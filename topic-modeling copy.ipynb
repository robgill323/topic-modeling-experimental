always a pleasure um i got a first question for you uh you asked this question i think on monday in a piece at the nation will um will benjamin netanyahu drag america into a big middle eastern war it is is uh a tribute to you that this uh question has nearly been answered uh just four days later um what well i think  um hes definitely trying you got to give bb credit right hes making the effort um i actually think its a very interesting thing thats going on right now because um both um the united states and iran do not want a big regional war h nor nor do the um arab autocracies that are aligned with the united states um and so what youre basically seeing is this very weird kabuki dance of uh people like you know trying to respond to various israeli provocations um uh and taking things to the limit of war but not war theres a  lot of kind of very curious calibration thats uh thats been going on um uh and this actually i mean to give credit where credits do uh george w bush by uh his idiotic decision to ev invade iraq um created a situation uh where um iraq is very friendly to iran and uh now acts as a kind of uh uh back channel or goet between the united states and iran so uh even before the um uh last saturdays bombings uh the us and iranians were talking and basically setting out the parameters for irans response um and  that has continued that the us is like you know uh basically trying to uh choreograph um this wrestling match so that you know both sides can get in their swipes uh without it actually being a situation where um you know we get world war i um how how long that can continue thats an open question right i mean were were walking on thin ice essentially but it is when you step back and just sort of contemplate this idea that in this incredibly volatile region everyone there like this is like you got  your best friend whos like trying to drag you into all sorts of fights but even the people hes trying to pick fights with are like no not interested its just sort of weird i mean is it i mean this is like were were like i mean aside from like the horrors associated with this when you step back and you look at this this is a very very strange dynamic and one which i dont i i i cant find at least within modern history any type of analogy to this um actually i think the analogy would be in um the  before the first world war which might not be the reassurance that you need uh but before the first world war both the um the russians and the uh austr hungarians and the the germans had various proxies in the balkans um as did britain and uh france and they were using these proxies to carry out battles and basically uh you know like uh um as these uh uh bulan proxies started to carry out uh horrific terrorist and assassination attacks the great powers got dragged into war because uh whats in the interest of the small power is to  get the big power to join them in their battle and fight their fight for them uh and thats not necessarily an interest of the big power although they want to show like they want to have this alliance system so i think that is the worrying precedent that you could have a situation um i also also sort of remember that warner brothers cartoon with the two dogs one of which is a very tough guy and the other is a little dog that follows him around and keeps getting to fights knowing that the big dog will uh join him in his fight uh and  that is basically the american israeli relationship you can also i think draw uh some comparison to the final years of south africas apartheid regime where they were beginning conflicts uh was angola zimb way um you know you can see a bit of the parallels of a of a regime of this kind being unsustainable and collapsing upon itself but of course the american israel relationship is so unique given the fact that we its the only country that has this powerhouse domestic lobbying organization in apac  with tens of millions of dollars that has been quite effective in basically buying our government in this in this way so much so that i i mean joe biden still has not made any substantive action despite some rhetorical shifts in funding israel and supporting it diplomatically including what we saw yesterday at the united nations vetoing that palestinian statehood uh resolution yeah no the south african analogy is i think exactly on point and its partially a matter of like they want theres two factors at work one is  the personal survival of benjamin netanyahu uh where you know like he knows like if theres no war hes done and so like if hes being pressured to like um ease up on gaza he has to have another war uh but beyond netanyahu and i i think we should never just blame netanyahu theres the israeli political system and the instincts of that political system have always been to like talk about anything other than the palestinians thats to say like never get to a position where you actually have to negotiate a two-state solution  um and the theory that theyve always had is theres always some other factor whether its saddam hussein or the iranians that are the real problem i mean this is like um right you might recall right after october 7th there were like these articles in the was in the wall street journal and elsewhere uh making the absurd argument that this was like uh basically an iranian plot that the iranians had caused october 7 and its because they would rather fight like a big war with iran which is a state and where you know you can like  bomb things then actually grapple with the real unsolvable dilemma that they have um this they occupy these uh population that will you know like uh refuses their rule so so theres a kind of distraction uh effect going on but its also about galvanizing western support right because this this supplemental which i know will talk about this aid to israel has been kind of just sitting there and um the at a time when public opinion in the west you know for the base of the democratic party here a majority of  people bidens voter base are outraged by this and want us to change policy on israel but and im sure netanyahu saw that and so this like original strike on the consulate into in in syria killing this top iranian general appears to me as a very obvious attempt for him to galvanize western military support if the threat of iran looms as public opinion was beginning to change on this gen on the support for this genocide yeah no i think that is the rationale and the logic although i have to say like if we get into a large war and  there are like a large number of american uh uh soldiers dying because of a war that israel started uh you know like public opinion which is already souring on israel like you know its gna go to a whole new place yeah i agree with that i mean did you see this thing in the uh supposedly in the times uh where supposedly israel was surprised that iran took issue with this um with im not joking they said they didnt see as a provocative action they didnt see it as a provocative action i mean the  what what is stunning to me is like the it there i have seen no outside of like all the speculation you talked about in the first days after october 7th i have seen no reporting whatsoever and and and and plenty of reports to the to the contrary that iran was involved in the planning of of october 7th or was even aware of it beforehand i mean that seems to be the consensus and yet here they are in the midst of uh this assault on gaza which is supposedly according to them existential theyre just like side  bombing uh you know syria and iran like just we didnt even think that anybody would even notice like what what who is this for it feels to me like this stuff is now just for deluded people to have something to hang on to do you know what i mean like its not convincing anybody absolutely yeah and i want to just underscore that like the only people that were saying that the iranians had for knowledge uh was basically the wall street journal and a few other right-wing outlets that were clearly being fed information um from  israeli intelligence but the consensus of american intelligence is the exact opposite that um not only were the iranians not involved with october 7th they were really taken by surprise uh by it and that actually explains a lot of their behavior of both um iran and hezbollah afterwards where theyve been really trying to like you know have hands off they dont want to get involved with a fight that they did not um uh know about and uh have any role in uh so i i actually think uh yeah who who is this for i mean like it is based on  the especially based on yeah appealing to that hardcore base and as a says galvanizing western opinion like there is a sort of you know if you can have a war with iran you you can um uh get that but its also based on the very practical reality that geor uh joe biden has given them a blank check and has always said you know you have ironclad support there are no red lines so if you have someone whos like you know willing to back you up all the way lets say youre like a rich kid and you have a  daddy who like you know every time you crash a car or you know you get into a bar fight hell always bail you out right uh lawyers always send lawyers guns and money then then youre going to act that way right this is the spoil literally did that with his kid but anyway yeah yeah yeah well and with his dogs i mean this is actually like bidens way of uh relating to uh um people the the irony is too is that i feel like you know well i think netanyahu knows that he needs to have these ongoing dramas to m maintain  his position you know to to not get booted out of office i think on some level like there has to be some measure of drama i also cant help i mean i think in i think that there is uh and while i agree with you you know netanyahu is is more symptomatic of a problem that exists in the israeli body uh um uh uh body politic as opposed to being sort of uh some outlier i dont think he is at all um but i do think that this is another case and i feel like this happened during the bush administration as well in fact thats  what i i i would imagine there was like some uh dissent as to whether um israel should have unilaterally pulled out of of of gaza and just converted it into essentially a a ghetto an open air prison or whatever it is you want to however you want to characterize it um but that there is no ballast of which the israeli administration can use the us government it feels like as a way of like justifying tapping the breaks at any point um i mean maybe this is happening internally you know when uh you know you  got even like ben gavier i think it was who said like the attack on iran our retaliation for irans retaliation was was weak and whatnot i mean obviously they have their incentive structure but nobody can credibly say like the us is going to cut off aid if we do anything different i mean like thats the thing they cant even say that no absolutely they cant say that no biden has given them a blank check and this is what you get and on the netanyahu point i mean absolutely his personal survival rests  on world war but if you actually look at like you know the reporting on whats going on in the war cabinet uh you know the so-called moderates um like gant like theyre actually like more eager for a war with irq than netanyahu is so i think structurally it is like the israeli state um basically the war in gaza has gone very badly i mean like if you think about it like its been six months and like kamas is still there and they havent recovered the hostages theyve done horrific horrific things uh and yes  of course if you have a modern army you can kill a lot of civilians but they have not achieved any of their military goals um and nor can they i mean they have no real like logical military goals there uh so so so they need another avenue for showing military prowess uh and then joe biden has you know like he said you know here are the car keys go wreck another car exactly um what what do you make of the vetoing of uh the un resolution for full membership for palestine the the us excuse on this was like well we do uh  support a palestinian state but we think it should be negotiated between the parties which essentially means they shouldnt be able to have one unless israel gives them permission to which as far as i can tell there were really no multi-party negotiations well lets put it this way not everybody was at the table uh when israel itself got its mandate from the un mh yeah no absolutely i mean like um well i mean theres a couple of things one is i i want to uh its a little bit interesting that before the  vote the us was like going to like all the uh countries on the council and uh saying like you know lets not bring this up can can you do us a favor you know like uh and its because they didnt want to have the vote and they didnt want to come out to be seen as against a palestinian state and i think that really shows the kind of game thats played here which is that the idea of a two-state solution a palestinian state is basically used as a rhetorical lip service like its something you pay tribute to but you  never actually act on and you never actually do um and i think its actually interesting that uh the um uh countries that they were going to uh trying to say like you know like lets not bring this to a vote uh they didnt listen to the united states the us has zero credibility on the international stage on this uh not just like in the global south but like you know like among tradition allies in in europe and asia yeah that i think is really the telling thing this is if you wanted to take a temperature and see  where the rest of the world is relative uh to their uh listening to the us two extensions is the best that the us could do um and i think that is uk and switzerland very very telling uh frankly thats right yeah thats right and then i mean of course the uk are the you know lap dogs of america so thats uh not surprising but uh uh yeah no i i i i the um this is really an example of american exceptionalism and it goes back to like emmas point about you know the the immense power of the israeli lobby uh  and the fact that the us has carved out um a very special position for israel which they give to no other country and the fact that even among that you know american exceptionalism joe biden is not an outlier to even that like he does not even have the self-respect of a you know bush senior or a clinton or an obama or a reagan who all at particular points said to israel enough is enough like joe biden does not have that in him uh and thats what makes this a very scary moment yeah let lets talk a little bit  about um the sort of i guess the the some of the politics around this like it it seems now that the majority of democrats um um in a significant majority are against you know this unconditional support uh to israel and there uh you know prior to this exchange with iran it seemed like there was at least some building momentum to condition aid um well talk a little bit about the supplemental thats winding its way through but um i was really struck by the protest that we saw i guess it was yesterday uh in at columbia  university um because it it does remind me weve mentioned uh you know south africa it reminds me of when i was in college when we were having this big um uh fight to divest from south africa and and rollin reagan was like you know constructive engagement sort of made up a a term for this um but there were hundreds i mean there were a lot of students on that campus and they brought in a bunch of cops to arrest them apparently uh ive learned from twitter that colombia is very very uh particular  about their lawns in their in their quad there apparently and their gate situation which they closed to because of all these outside agitators you know but this is this is like the these were very peaceful protest i mean there thats the thing that really struck me theyre bringing in hundreds of cops to arrest just a frid a thursday afternoon sitting on the quad protest it was pretty crazy well i mean the most remarkable thing is you know there the administration that called it in and the nypd in their statement said well you  know these were peaceful protesters and we didnt actually see anything you know that was going on here uh but we were called in right like like he so so the administration of columbia university is officially like more like lets crackheads than the nypd uh and i just to be clear with people this is how they did it they basically voked the rights of students to hang out on the quad essentially uh on this day so they they it was trespassing that they were arrested for uh and thats yeah its an  amazing thing its an amazing thing and and particularly since you know we have a long history of this going back to the vietnam war and the south african protest where you know like its actually a very bad thing for a university president to like call in the cops on protesters thats a good way to lose your legitimacy uh with faculty and with students uh but i mean university pre uh presidents are facing pressure from another end uh one is political theyre being dragged before congress in these kind of show trials you know like  to say like what are you doing to fight anti-semitism uh but also from the donor class and um uh um i i saw really interesting analysis of this which is that the universities are um being hit on two pressure points uh one is from the donor class which includes a lot of people that are you know either pro-israel or just pro status quo quo they dont like protest they dont like disruption uh and then they have the students um uh which are politically very different uh and increasingly um you know like international um i this is  one way american universities like continue to go that they get students from all over the world and therefore are like you know like far like more progressive on this uh than the than the donors and but the university needs both for income right like they need the student tuition and they need the donors uh to uh give um you know uh grants and alumni funding uh so um basically its like like which side are you on question and a lot of university prof uh administrations are well you know the donors they they write the big checks  you know like that is the side that theyre on and i think thats a its a pretty grave mistake well i mean look youre youre going to get phone calls from donor owners you youre not getting calls from prospective um uh students who they are yet theyre also not listening to their the teachers on their campuses right thats the other thing where the administrators are basically as youre saying g responsive to the the donor class and the big money donor specifically at these elite universities  and you have the professors who are engaging with these topics and want to preserve uh free expression on campuses the exact place where you know you should be having these discussions this is what liberal educa education is ostensibly supposed to be for and the administrators are actively um and including the colombia uh president who went in front of congress and did not provide really any defense for her student body or the academic freedom at the institution um and who criticized professors at her own university uh you  know like slandered like you know uh professors there which is like a really shocking thing um yeah yeah know i think that the university presidents are in unt tenable position um and to go back to this south african example the um i think it was um uh gmat in um the father of the actor whos the president of y yeah yeah who you know was a former major league baseball commissioner as well but he was also i did not know that actually yeah yeah yeah yeah he called in the cops on south african protesters um and  that was basically the end of his like reain as president like he lost huge amount of legitimacy um and you know like did not have faculty support uh and even among the donor class like it is the big donors that are for this but like you know theres a lot of medium level donors you know who are just like normal liberal democrats and theyre seeing this stuff and theyre not liking it so so yeah yeah i just think uh um i mean it really shows you you know in stark relief um you know like uh the power centers um uh where the power is  and how much power is it odd with democratic sentiment its going to be interesting too to see how um what trajectory this sends this generation on in terms of its politics um its i think you made that point on um on twitter that its you know sort of like making clear whose toes are where and and whose toes are being stepped on yeah no no i mean its something i i think about a lot i mean you know we obviously have the example of the 60s um but its also the case and a lot of this has a racial dimension as well i mean a  lot of the sort of changes in the university are you get um you know this cohort that are immigrants people of color often the first of their family to go to university and um and you know like the val doran at um uh university of south carolina you know who was denied you know like a top student val usc in california california yeah uh whos not allowed to speak because of uh her pro palestine sentiment so so so youre gonna get these people who are you know traditionally you want to integrate them  into the american elite you want to like you know like like make these people you know your next generation of leaders and but but theyre learning you know like like like what the contradictions of power are in america um and and yeah its a huge alienating effect um yeah im hoping it doesnt depoliticize people but you know like you know sends them in the right direction yeah i have a feeling this is not going to depoliticize people in the way that maybe some some element of people coming out of the 60s were depoliticized yeah  um i mean its not as broad-based as what was going on with that generation there was a lot more there was a lot of different factors i think uh involved in that that um arent here in the same way and frankly i think ultimately you know the odd thing is is that there is pretty to the extent that there is a silent majority um they are probably in agreement with those protesters uh oddly enough they may not be as motivated they may not you know it may not be as high on their agenda but if they were forced  to decide i think its pretty close uh certainly the the the majority of american public now is just sort of like this is this is too much um the whats going on</th>\n",

       "      <th>but i wanted to not get past the free portion of this show on this news day without talking about this big news as well i mean of course we mentioned it yesterday but um the escalation of these massive campus demonstrations in solidarity with palestine with the people of gaza demanding that their universities divest from weapons manufacturers from contracts with the government of israel and more um colombia kicked this off with the encampment that was met with massive a massive crackdown by the  administration with the nypd um that was not enough for someone like tom cotton by the way the republican senator who if you find yourself agreeing with this fascist freak as a liberal zionist perhaps maybe check yourself and take a look in the mirror um he has called for uh the national guard to be sent on these protesters which is he loves doing that he really does but remember when he said that in 2020 about black lives matter protesters and he took out an oped in the new york times and it was met with  outrage wheres the outrage here because well theres less so because the instances of anti-semitism that you know im sure there are anti-semitic incidents but they are by every account extremely marginal extremely marginal talk about that in the fun half but the headlines are dominating just those mar the the are dominated by just those marginal instances nothing about what theyre actually asking for um thats the focus and so you can have these like fascists like tom cotton saying these kinds of  things and there not be honestly the push back thats necessary uh uh to dis to to meet this moment of the biggest crackdown on campus activism and free speech since the 60s um and i think cotton calling the national guard invoking kent state was clearly deliberate by the way by the way victims of kent state were jewish i think three of the four as our victims of uh columbia angu and yales crack down disproportionately jewish disproportionately jewish the jewish voice for peace activists um and jewish  voice for peace specifically targeted by the administration um to cease their operations so what was amazing though was as these demonstrations continue to grow the faculty in these schools are demonstrating incredible solidarity with their students and it goes to show that our education system its so deeply corrupt in ways i think that that perhaps you know we all understand it but this lays it so bare i mean robert craft pulling his money after shade davidai got his uh pass revoked i mean it says everything you need to know  it says everything you need to know that the administration is beholden and the administrators are beholden to these massive wealthy benefactors who get to determine the direction of these higher learning institutions and those doing educating and the educated are really not the priority and so this was just honestly a really moving display you can see here how many faculty members walked out of colombia in solidarity with the rest of the students um because yeah its not just crazy kids the crazy leftist kids who are  anti-semitic its also the teachers the scholars who when you really do scholarship and you really understand the history of palestine um the immorality of the israel israeli project is incredibly clear so of course academia is going to understand this and they also understand what it means to stand with their students this was the crowd some theyre you know cing down uh and this was a speech here too from another columbia professor addressing the student body christopher brown whos a history  professor speaking to the students um about his concerns about free speech good afternoon im christopher brown professor in the history department this is the first time ive ever held a microphone at a protest of any kind im not sure with thats something to take pride in or not but i say it because this is not typical for me im here because i am so concerned about what is happened to this university with where we are now and with where we are going thursday april 18 2024 will be remembered as a shameful day in  colombias history the presidents decision to send riot police to pick up peaceful protesters on our campus was unprecedented unjustified disproportionate divisive and dangerous we are fortunate we dont know how fortunate we are we are fortunate that no one was hurt yes yes with that kind of shower for with those all those firearms all it takes is one person to get nervous a table to fall a car or truck to backfire on allen amsterdam avenue shots fired do you know police department does not belong on this campus except in g  moments and that show of course that show of force was a sign of [music] weakness shame on in trying to show that they metant business what they showed was their incompetence we can keep it rolling thats what i was trying to say i want to say one other thing and thats about the congressional testimony on wednesday de and this is about academic freedom its also about colombia in 3 hours of testino the president of the university to my mind showed no pride in our institution [music] she said nothing she said nothing meaningful she  said nothing meaningful about the virtues of this institution of its people of its faculty of its staff of its researchers their dedication to excellence their commitment to their students the quality the quality of the undergraduates and graduate students that we have here [applause] the distinctive record of academic accomplishment and impact the variety and rigor of the scholarship which is happening here today the prospects for continued excellency she didnt say anything about any of those  things she allowed slander of our institution to stand without rebuke soviet style education no response all right in we got a good the whole speech is really worth it honestly so i wanted to keep it rolling a bit but um yeah i mean there were other there have been other uh professors from colombia and barard who have spoken out essentially some that weve had on the show adam tws has been great uh speaking out on on behalf of this of course you know ri k i i saw some people recognizing recognizing pro professors that theyd  had at nyu who were being handcuffed and and walking out in by the nypd in solidarity with their student body yeah as a nyu grad um it is a shame that this morning theyre putting a a wall in front of uh that uh i dont know if its i forget what the um uh building names are but yeah just build in the wall very on the nose um and just to like put into context heres some other things about what are happening on the campus uh united nations human rights office of the high commissioner after 6 months of military assault more than  5,479 students 261 teachers and 95 university professors have been killed in gaza and o and over 7,819 students and 756 teachers have been injured with numbers growing each day uh and i soulon uh said this on twitter and this is my response to a lot of um i think uh people in media whether theyre editors or um sort of rapid response columnists but soan says this i think stopping to do to policing or individual condemnations of random people at protests of a literal genocide is gravely irresponsible and conveys a lack  of seriousness dont do it it is never worth it and any audience that demands it is on isnt on your side to begin with and that is how i feel about all of this is not worth the time if i was a if i was an editor for a newspaper i would put i would cover how thirsty israel is for jewish people to be victimized so they can use it to uh as propaganda for an ethnic cleansing c campaign way before i would be covering these incidents which are the responsibility of local authorities if theres anti-semitism going on on campus that is  the job for campus administrators it is not a cnn news story it is appalling that this is used up any time when people are being like 18 more kids killed by bomb blast of the day it is pro genocide uh uh uh maneuver that were seeing this is this is literally a psychological operation that so many zionists are drawing our attention to this they they responded and i mean these administrators and administrations basically responded in unison i mean coordinated theres this is a there are well-funded groups that  are basically sending out outrage uh threats to these universities and they have the ability the same groups that were doxing harvard students and putting their information up on led moving trucks outside of harvard square um theres a lot of money behind maintaining the war machine maintaining our relationship with israel for ideological and then al racist reasons and then also of course you know the is israel is a weapons manufacturer and trader and an outpost for us interests in the region um and a  destabilizing force which some people benefit from so theres a a lot there but the point here is that academia and people interested in educating others and those who want to be educated are standing and raising their voice including many many jewish students to oppose this um and its an important moment in our history for sure and its time to step up like all the professors i ive been so happy to find like you know nyu professors speaking out uh about this even ones that werent at the actual protest but its we really  need this right now this is an absolute emergency and we played uh um that professor uh speaking at spellman i forget her name um rua benjamin rua benjamin yeah um talk and like we need that across the board uh and this is absolutely one of these times where its not time to be silent</th>\n",

       "      <th>came across this clip over the weekend this is from 2018 but i really liked watching this not just because it was actually good journalism that you rarely get to see um but because this is a preview of what we are going to see in 20 years with these pro-israel politicians or anybody that is coming of age in this time and seeking power who wants to get elected office where did you stand on gaza where did you stand on the genocide of the palestinian people because theres a lot of revisionist history that happens  but margaret thatcher the conservatives ronald reagan the conservatives in this country in the 80s were immensely supportive of the apartheid regime in south africa they accused the anc of being communists and terrorists as well and uh there were many of the the same tactics of suppression used against college students protesting apartheid at that time so this is an interview in 2018 when teresa may who at the time you was involved in politics but was not supportive of nelson mandela and uh thec  in the efforts to to combat apartheid um going in 2018 to visit robin island where he was in prison red to honor him and channel 4s michael crick asks her basically how do you have the g visit robin ireland you were active in politics in the 70s and 80s what did you do to help release man nelson mandela well i think what is important is what the united kingdom did and no no what did you do what did you do did did you go on protests did you get arrested outside the embassy did you boycott south african goods did you do anything  i think you know for well that i didnt go on protests michael but what is important is the work that the united did you boycott satan goods the work that the united kingdom government did to ensure that it was able to give support where that support hang on at that stage mrs thater mrs thatcher believed that nelson mandela was a terrorist were you a loyal conservative party member did you think the same thing what was important was the support that the uk government was giving at the time often support behind the scenes um  but in in other ways too we saw to ensure that we saw the results that we did in relation to the ending of apartheid here in south africa a government led by a woman who thought that nelson mandela was a terrorist now youre going to be going to robin ireland arent you going to be feeling guilty that at the time nelson mandela was on robin ireland you theresa may did nothing to help his release you personally what i what i will be feeling i think when i go to robin island uh is to recognize the immense stans ship  statesmanship of a man who spent so many years incarcerated statesmanship and when he came out of that incarceration had that he was incar he was incarcerated in part due to the fact that the resistance the western western governments like the uk and the united states um were supportive of the apartheid regime and did not pressure this the white the white apartheid regime to release their biggest political prisoner because that was a threat to their power and i just found that to be a fun clip for how she  squirms but also a basically a window into the future well and the present like theres a reason that south africa still hasnt got around to the land reforms that were promised in that in those good times in the 9s uh and its because probably the thats thats actually the role that britain plays is okay youre going to get rid of a partti lets see how to do this in a way that actually is fine for capital so thats actually the role that people like that played when they say they played a role because the  real radical role that got that got aparted out of there was played by like uh you know radicals like mandelo or you know i mean we had ronnie cow was on communists um uh who helped uh um sabotage efforts and uh sort of resistance armed resistance like the mk uh like which obviously the britain britain was not supporting um behind the scenes they were uh yeah exactly so behind the scenes that it was almost ind discernible yeah we have literally call him the guy a terrorist this is like the video equivalent of like when the cia  tweets like happy martin luther king exactly exactly well okay we remember a civil rights hero that we absolutely did not tell to did not tell to commit suicide when he during his time okay and the men not just that he was deemed a terrorist he was deemed a terrorist until 2008 he was on the terrorist watch list nelson nelson mandela and then these western governments have the g to to herald uh the figures who actually made the sacrifice as heroes and pretend we were with them all along this is what  will happen in 20 years but hopefully well have a new crop of leaders then that were inv d in boycotting israel in dismantling this project in standing up for the palestinian people and theyll be able to answer that question better than teresa may yeah i mean speaking of books to read um long walk to freedom by nelson mandela is another one that everybody probably should read think the audio books pretty widely available too but he frankly like talks about um things like armed resistance and  sabotage and even um terrorism and you know obviously he says uh terrorism we decided not to do it obviously for just distasteful reasons of of committing it but also it would have a negative effect but he says that if that the fight got so dire that that was the only thing that they were left to i would just read those chapters and maybe see if theres any other things that applies to in terms of whos responsible for when violence breaks out in a colonial situation for</th>\n",

       "      <th>hello welcome to cbn news my name is dan andros and the us has warned of an imminent attack by iran on israel could be within the next 24 to 48 hours cbn middle east bureau chief chris mitchells joining me now from jerusalem to discuss chris what is the latest here with this threat were hearing about well dan a lot of people here in israel are preparing certainly the idea is preparing uh for a potential imminent attack uh they say theyre prepared for the offense or the defense uh defense minister yav galant uh actually we were  in a briefing in with him uh just about on wednesday uh he brought up iran himself he said that if theres any attack against israel from iran they will uh attack iran directly uh theres been a lot of activity lately uh the head of sent centcom has visited here with iav galant theres been a call from from lloyd austin the uh secretary of defense to yuav galant saying that its ironclad the cooperation and the relationship between the united states and israel also president joe biden has said the same thing that uh and he b  basically gave a warning to iran basically what he said at the beginning of the war after october 7 and his word was dont so uh but a lot of people are anticipating the possibility of an attack here and theres speculation that maybe it could be uavs drones missiles even cyber attack against israel all because of what happened on april 1st with a reported uh israel attack on the uh iranian consulate in uh damascus that killed a major uh islamic uh regime general as well as c several of his aids  so thats part of the scenario playing out right here dan anecdotally was uh i have i go to a gym just around the corner here and uh one of the guys that i almost see almost every day there hes uh hes very concerned as as well our sums about this possible attack yeah and uh you know one thing i want to note here when you hear the iran saying that well this you know or at least the reports or wherever theyre getting this information from whats sourcing inside of iran saying that this attack potentially imminent because of  this attack in earlier in april by israel of course that neglects to mention iran and their role in october 7th and the attack there right they did they conveniently sort of leave that part out as if israel somehow provoked this attack on iran its just really remarkable to watch that spin happen and unfold and the understanding is that the general that was killed muhammad zahad was part of planning october 7th so uh certainly they theyre they theyre complicit in in what was what happened on october 7th uh they fund theyve  helped arm theyve helped train uh hamas terrorists and they have this whole plan uh in the middle east right now to surround israel with h proxies that can do what their goal is to destroy the jewish state they have hamas in the gaza strip they have hezbollah in lebanon on the northern border they have iranian back militias in both syria and iraq uh and they also have the hooes down in yemen and what we heard today as well is the threat to jordan uh one nation that is right on the border theres almost uh  500 kilometers thered be about im doing my quick math here maybe about 300 miles of border on uh israels eastern border that would be very dangerous if anything happened to the uh kingdom of jordan so their whole goal is eventually to have hman here in in the region and uh certainly to destroy the jewish is one of their goals so i see in the by the way in the comments here were monitoring everyone in the stream were thankful youre all here i see about i dont know 1,200 of you right now which is great and uh  were glad youre here leave your questions in the chat i see one uh here i saw one iran is seems like theyre all bark no bite what do you make of of that do you do you think this is all more just chattering from iran or how seriously are people taking it there and israel well people are taking it seriously but its a good comment because uh sometimes iran does have a lot of bark uh but maybe not so much bite and uh theres two things i think to mention about that first of all their m mo modus up arandi is to use proxies  uh they really dont necessarily want to get directly involved uh so theyll use hezbollah the hamas the houis uh the iranian back militias in syria and iraq but not hit israel directly and thats part of the chatter going on in the last few days is that israels been warning israels foreign minister uh yov cat said if you hit israel directly from iran were going to hit you directly in iran uh but the other thing is that uh and we heard this earlier today from yal carmon hes the head of the uh middle  east media research institute and they monitor uh all the arabic uh farsy uh media what theyre saying and his analysis is that uh they really dont necessarily need to respond directly to what happened on april 1 even though it was very painful uh in a direct attack against their major uh military leadership but theyre looking at the long game theyre playing a strategic game uh he says their main goal right now is to overthrow the kingdom of jordan and which would hurt israel far greater than perhaps a limited attack  back that would last a day or two so its a good comment and you have to take uh you know sort of these things and see how things play out uh with where there be attack and then how israel could or would respond and then what will happen uh you know if if they just play the long game yeah all right were talking to cbns chris mitchell live in jerusalem and we thank you all for joining i see even more people are joining into the chat here which is into this live stream which is great and if youre just joining us there has been a  warning from the us they have warned that there could be an imminent attack with possibly within the next 24 to 48 hours on israel is from iran theyre saying its in retaliation for attack that chris just mentioned uh on iran in um earlier this month uh chris and i got we got a question here from one tired mama in there says what i dont understand is this everyone knows the proxies are from iran right hezbollah etc and theyre supported by iran if any of those proxies attack we all know its iran so why would iran not be directly  attacked in other words i guess why are they surprised uh its a good question and and its part of i think sort of the military diplomatic uh dance that goes on here in the middle east uh theres almost like unwritten rules that uh you know if for example israel would hit iran directly that would change the whole dynamic theres something similar going up in the northern border right now we had a israeli uh intelligence officer talked to us uh a few weeks ago and he said you know uh israel will hit  certain targets hezbollah will will hit certain targets but they they dont seem to go above this sort of unwritten line in the sand uh to escalate the uh the conflict any bigger than it already is i mean theres been a low-scale war up on the northern border for since october 8 so but it really hasnt escalated into a major major conflict although many people are anticipating perhaps in may perhaps in june that there will be a major conflict up on the north uh between hezbollah and israel but its a  very good question you know why dont they just hit iran directly im not sure israel necessarily right now as its embroiled in the gaza wants to get involved in a major war directly uh with iran and i ill add this stand as well you know i i know a lot of people here in israel uh even in the government uh want christians around the world to know uh what the situation is here in israel uh and they want people to pray and they want people to intercede stand in the gap for uh the jewish state and for the  threats that its going uh through right now and also that the jewish people around the world and and israelis here would realize uh that theyre not alone that many of their christian friends uh around the world are standing with them in prayer and in support yeah most definitely praying for the people there and for you and your team there chris as well of course and you know and i just remember uh listening to you talk about this and the threats from the north you know our own george thomas just had a  report from up there as well talking about uh i think he talked to a former intelligence uh officer there who analyzes all these threats and theyre saying that hezbollah is more well uh funded and more precise than they ever have been before and so the the threat of an attack from up north is so much higher now because we saw what happened obviously on october 7th that theyre willing to do it this isnt just a theory anymore that they that they threaten to invade threaten to wipe israel off the map no theyll actually  do it and their capabilities are surprisingly high thats was that surprising to you to learn that well no weve been hearing that but there was a great report by george the other day and he talked to uh uh the head of alma which is a research center right there on the northern border he was in kash monona and uh its a great report so if anybody wants to see that go to cbn news there on youtube or cbnnews.com and the point that the intelligence officer was making that the last war between israel and uh and  hezbollah was in 2006 we were there on that border uh covering that war and at the time it was estimated that hezbollah had maybe 14 to 15,000 rockets and during that 34 day war they shot almost 4,000 rockets uh about a million israelis were either in bomb shelters or they fled the northern part of the country uh during that time and uh and right now you have a similar scenario you have uh towns like kirat shimona a town of about 24,000 people nearly ghost towns right now all along the israeli lebanese border maybe about 880,000 uh  israelis are uh no longer living in their homes theyre living in hotels in fact right across the street theres a hotel we believe that people from the north are staying in but if you compare what happened in 2006 14,000 rockets i would say a conservative estimate would be that it hasah now has maybe 150,000 rockets ive heard over 300,000 rockets many of those rockets can reach almost anywhere in israel they can theyre precision guided so they can hit uh military install they could hit power plants uh in fact  theres been talk here in the last several weeks even for the last few months that people want or maybe buying generators getting storing up with food and water for maybe three days or so and uh because the threat from hezbollah is so much greater than hamas and uh even though theyve been fighting for several months now theres still much of their arsenal is still intact youre just joining us now were talking to cb bns chris mitchell in israel hes in jerusalem and we are responding to this threat and the the  warning that has come from the united states about a potential imminent attack here by iran on israel could be in the next 24 to 48 hours chris and were glad that you all here and be kind im looking at the comments here we are monitoring these comments and when you get a stream this big we got 3,700 people on here almost and theres inevitably going to be trolls in there pray for the pray for the trolls in there that are doing and whatever it is that theyll do so be kind pray for them theyre lost and uh lost souls so uh  they need grace too so be praying for them but chris i wanted to ask what what would an an attack look like most likely if this were to happen im praying it doesnt and it and it is all bark and no bite as we were talking about earlier but what what type of attack would we expect to see if if something did happen i think you go back to uh what might happen would be 2019 there was an attack by iran against saudi arabias largest oil refinery uh we were actually happen to be in saudi arabia at the time and uh  it really devastated that particular plant and put it out of action for you know several weeks or maybe a few months so that could be you know any major installation infrastructure here in israel that could be one possible scenario uh i me mentioned cyber attack that could be another uh possibility and uh you know and just as as weve talked about you know using their proxies and maybe hezbollah would shoot some of their precision guided missiles to hit some sort of an installation perhaps a military installation here in uh in  israel so theres a variety of scenarios and uh so they may play out in the next 24 48 hours or we may see like yal kman said uh is iran using what they call strategic patience and waiting and not necessarily responding uh in kind in the next few hours or few days and uh and play play as we said the long game well ill tell you whats not helping chris is youre seeing a lot of language from the biden administration urging israel to go into a ceasefire and so if other enemies of israel are looking at this i would imagine correct  me if im wrong here chris but i would imagine these enemies are looking at this saying oh so we can attack israel take hostages do whatever we want and then theyre going to all yell at israel and tell them to stop fighting back great i mean it seems like youre just giving the green light to iran to hezbollah to to go ahead and launch an attack thats a great point dan because i think thats exactly how many israelis feel is that uh you know the biden ministration by restraining uh uh trying to restrain israel from going into rafa  the last major hamas stronghold in the gaza strip emboldens the position of hamas and their sense is that if if the us is going to restrain israel then well whats our incentive to go ahead and release hostages or surrender or but it it emboldens them that they can hold on maybe survive now you know in 2021 there was a war between israel and hamas it lasted about 11 days uh hamas didnt win but they didnt lose and now if they didnt if they dont lose in many ways they consider that a victory so they  have four five battalions left in rafa uh they believe that if israel uh is restrained by the united uh states and by other countries they can hold on and so i think thats their strategy right now and they understand whats going on diplomatically and they they read whats going on uh and so i think many people here feel like the restraint by the us is undermining uh israels ability to destroy hamas which they committed to after october 7th and you know the sense here dan among most israelis is that  they need to finish the job this is not um it for them its existential its a war for their survival some people have called it their second war of independence uh and so they feel they need to finish the job and the us restraining them they believe is uh not helping at all once again if youre just joining us uh chris mitchell here live from jerusalem talking about this imminent threat potentially that has been israel has been warned by the us that they have intelligence i i suppose on this attack  that could happen within the next 24 to 48 hours chris i mean is this sort of thing unprecedented here for iran i mean i guess knowing that weve seen an attack on israel happen now physically beyond just rocket a couple rockets you know that you know were bad enough before uh with a full scale invasion essentially so we with that context in our minds here um is this unprecedented territory for iran to sort of not be hiding as much behind the proxies on this sort of a threat or has this happened before well i i think you go  back to uh i believe 2020 when the united states uh killed general sumani the head of the uh islamic republic military and uh actually in that and we were talking to yal kman earlier today about that uh there was actually an attack against the us base uh i believe in uh kur the kurdistan area of of iraq uh that was actually coordinated with the uh the united states according to igal kon in other words uh iran said well this is what were going to do were going to send missiles against uh a us base but they warned them uh that  it was coming and so the commander of that uh that base was able to get some of their uh soldiers out of harms way uh i believe there were some injuries related to that but nobody was killed in that so perhaps this is happened before and uh well see actually how this how this is going to play out with uh uh in the next 24 48 hours or even longer all right chris again this is cbns chris mitchell i just want to take a moment here and quick pause everyone in the chat almost 5,000 people in the chat and as chuck always likes to say  during his live streams make sure you hit the like on this stream

hit that hit that like button were all glad youre here and im looking for questions here the chats are going by very very quickly on my screen so youll have to like write question and and big letters uh for for me to catch it so uh if you got question for chris our cbn news middle east bureau chief he is  there in jerusalem and and uh can can answer that question for you hello from texas were glad youre here so uh chris im interested in the the people asking for prayers so uh tell me more about that how whats going on there and i i think i just find it interesting that people that you know in these circles that that have connections to uh the politicians there and theyre asking you for prayers tell me tell me about that a little bit you know uh dan i think ever since october 7th happened i dont know  of anybody that ive told people that people are praying for israel and praying for the leaders or offered to pray for them individually i dont know if anybody that wasnt comforted wasnt encouraged uh by the fact that uh you know many christians uh pray and and ask god to protect them to give them wisdom to give them comfort the scripture that comes to my mind is isaiah 40:1 comfort comfort ye might people and i i think theres a real hunger uh put it that way uh in thirst for prayer and uh how  people can uh can just pray for them many many secular people i was in near o which was a kabot that was devastated on october 7th and there was a man who was a secular man giving us a tour and uh i i asked him at the very end can i pray for you and he said well im secular but ill take all the help i can get and so i prayed briefly for him and uh and you could just tell the impact that it had on him the the the sense of peace the sense of calm uh because so many israelis have been traumatized by this  uh dan by what happened on october 7th its hard to know anybody that doesnt know somebody that was either kidnapped or murdered and uh you have to uh and so theyre really traumatized and really grieving and mourning and uh and so some people have said you know ive heard a few things like this israel is in h great need of a a a hot shower and a good nights sleep or you could say this is its not say april 11th its day its october 187th or something like that its really part of their psyche  right now and so prayer is a big part of comforting them and dan i know we can do this on live because were being just uh natural ive got 10% left i could always go in there and and uh yeah can go get plugged in chris you go get plugged in because i have to respond i have to respond here chris and you can listen to me i was going im i apologize im going to hop on my soap box here for a minute while youre while chris is getting plugged in so he doesnt lose power uh on us hes hes doing that  right now im looking in the super i appreciate all those super chats that have come in harper an one tired mama del delita i think is how you pronounce that or del appreciate those uh super chats we really do appreciate it terry i see that coming in as well and theres a super chat in here from someone named ham who says look ham you know i appreciate the donation were going to use this to keep um talking and praying and giving news from a christian perspective he wrote wrote free palestine stop defending the genocide  and i i just have to address this idea that somehow israel is committing a genocide now the difference here between is its just its ridiculous enough to compare the two at all but you can see nobodys perfect but when israel has something happen in the fog of war thats a mistake what is the difference between what israel does and what hamas does hamas comes out and they lie they make up numbers they they do all kinds of things theyre hiding behind people as human shields theyre in hospitals  theyre in schools that is how theyre behaving putting innocent people at risk and lying and not telling the truth and then you have israel when something goes wrong and when those aid workers were killed by an israeli strike what happened they owned up to it and they said we made a mistake and they fired the people that were responsible for that mistake and so theres a level of accountability there and it just shows the difference between the two and so to call what is happening and what israel  is doing a genocide is just i find it offensive personally and so i apologize for getting stirred up but when someone gets attacked like they got attacked on october 7th for for them to then be called a genocide when they respond is its frustrating chris and i can only imagine how you feel over there and so uh ill get off my soap box now but ham i appreciate the donation we will take it and we will keep reporting news from a christian perspective so chris if youre able to if youre plugged back in  you can respond to that or you can leave it ill leave it up to you no im plugged back in uh dan i i would add that um john spencer who is a military historian is saying that and who has studied war he studied the war in iraq and afghanistan uh has said that israel has done more than any modern army in order to live limit civilian casualties uh how do they do that they text people they call people they drop leaflets they basically telegraph exactly where and uh theyre going and what theyll be doing  to in order to save civilian lives uh so thats one thing uh the other thing is that uh whats been quoted in the um the media and by many politicians including uh president biden is that you know 33,000 palestinians have died in gaza uh we know that um those numbers dont add add up statistically and and add that any death any um unnecessary death is a tragedy and yet hamas often or does use uh its own civilians as uh propaganda so in many ways their deaths serve the hamas strategy of making hamas become the victim and  the palestinians the victim which changes uh which gets reported in the press which has an impact on public policy which is have has an impact on politicians its part of their strategy that they use their own people as human shields uh its been documented there have been times when hamas is actually shooting or preventing their own people from getting out of harms way and and so its its not genocide if they really wanted to have genocide israel could do it but they dont and they because they  dont want to uh and they wont and so as you said that that uh that strike the other day was a tragic accident um in in the fog of war and the chief of staff the prime minister the defense minister all apologize profusely for the accident and the loss of innocent life so i guess that would be what i would say to add what you had already said yeah and to your point i mean i just my experience the i know youre over there all the time and i know you were there when uh former president trump moved the us  embassy there into jerusalem we were there for that and remember there were big protests at the gaza border at that time and there was a big day where a bunch of people that were obviously now we know likely hamas terrorists trying to break through the fence with violent intentions and they got killed trying to do that warned about it still tried to break through the fence they were throwing these molotov cocktail things on kites over there i saw those firsthand floating them over and theyd explode on the other side um but uh  jonathan kriz showed us chris this and you probably have seen these but maps that that hamas had printed out online and they were little maps of the towns on the southern border that got probably the same towns that got attacked on october 7th and it was showing and saying were going to kill jews once we get through the fence and thats why they were taking it seriously but the media reported exactly as you were saying that look at how israel is treating these people that were trying to go through the fence and literally  exactly what krias told me at that time happened on october 7th it it was exactly what they said they were going to do if they got through and it is what they did once they got through so uh its its frustrating to watch the media spin it the way they do and they just sort of take this stance where they just take the things that hamas says and then they just run with them and its its its frustrating to watch and its why you frankly its why you need places like cbn news and people like chris  mitchell who are out there to give you the truth on these sorts of issues so all right chris i want to ask you another question from the comments here royal q writes do you think this will lead to world war i three now thats obviously extrapolating a lot of whats going on but i dont know if youve got a take on that some people think were already in world war i right now yeah uh uh and and i you know the a war with radical islam uh that just morph into different manifestations um it could lead to a  regional war it could uh if theres i would say that here there seems to be what a a progression that that many people think will happen the progression is that uh israel will be able to defeat hamas in its last stronghold in rafa and that it will eventually then turn to hezbollah up on the north and uh that therell be a a war there much bigger uh maybe longer and maybe not depending on the scale of the war and how fast it goes or maybe how uh how much firepower israel can um can exert on hezbollah i  have been ever since 2006 uh ive heard personally from a general up on the border and what other military leaders have said that um uh they may bomb lebanon into of the stone age uh they wont fight the next war with esbah the way they fought it in 2006 so definitely it could lead to a much bigger war now if then hezbollah if if after that then uh some people may believe that would be the time to take out irans nuclear facilities something that really hasnt been reported a lot during these last  several months is the fact that isra iran is really on the cusp of uh being a nuclear power or the threshold they almost have uh they have a lot of uh enriched uranium to almost military grade they do have ballistic missiles he could put the question is i think uh the missing link right now now is the fact of whether they could miniaturize a nuclear device and put it on a ballistic missile so that would be the the key element uh of of what israel could do and as our friend joal wenberg says if they go nuclear they could do in six  minutes what took six years for adolf hitler to do to kill six million jews yeah thats a frightening thought there um all right more questions chris uh rebecca asked shes from the netherlands says why should iran warn before attacking wouldnt a surprise attack be more logical from irans perspective so yeah thats a good question i mean it makes you think are they doing this just to put this out there and to frighten or is it just yeah i just ill just throw the question to you i wont try to  speculate well i think what happened is when after the strike hit that they wanted to get out there at least verbally or rhetorically that they would hit back at israel and uh that they at a time of their choosing i think the time frame may be coming more from uh us intelligence uh the wall street journal is reporting that that this attack could be could be uh not necessarily will be but could be in the next 24 to 48 hours that certainly uh takes away the whole element of surprise if iran will do what  they do um with the caveat that maybe they will as we mentioned uh use time and uh strategic patience and wait for another time i i think one of the things they did say they will they will react at a at a time and a place of their choosing so but certainly as soon as that attack took place im sorry im going to have to get my camera a little steadier here sorry will uh they they will certainly respond in some kind at some time all right if youre just joining us now and again appreciate you all being  here we got 6100 people on the chat on the stream right now appreciate that um and appreciate you all contributing with uh super chats that is very much appreciated and johnny thank you for your super chat by the way johnny b and he also asked monthly subscription plan is it coming here on youtube uh that good question um be interested to hear from you all would you uh potentially subscribe to a monthly subscription to help support cbn news because i mean look we are largely viewer funded i we are we are donation  based we are a ministry and so we rely heavily on your support so uh that would be that would be an interesting question johnny to see how many people here would would hop on to a subscription on youtube uh i mean i know that because youtube provides the platform that uh you you have to essentially engage in some sort of revenue split on things uh from that angle so thats not optimal but on the other hand it is great to be on a place like youtube where there are millions and millions of people uh out  there that you can reach outside of your own walls when we have a stream like this and you guys like it and were up to 1100 likes if you havent liked the stream yet go ahead and do that by the way 6,000 of you on there 1100 likes keep doing that it helps it get out there more so it is a great tool for us to uh do these live streams so that you can talk and engage directly people like chris mitchell who are experts on things like the middle east and whats happening there and doing it from a christian perspective so uh it its a  great tool and we are happy to use it and i were up to almost a couple million subscribers now and so thats been fantastic its been a great tool for us so far here on cbn so so to answer your question about a subscription its something weve weve thought about but uh i mean i could take just a little straw poll here from all of you 6,000 people are in here would you would you go ahead and subscribe to it i and so i dont know maybe we can get a maybe we can get a uh gauge the temperature on that so all right chris i  know its late over there so are you good first of all i mean i should ask this before we keep going we didnt really discuss we we saw the news this this imminent threat here from iran and we didnt really talk about a time and how long were how long we would go so are you good to hang for a few more minutes i am good yes fine okay good so yeah all right so again if youre just joining us here this this threat from iran um what what are what are some other thoughts you have on this chris and you know as far as youre youre  there now so i mean you know what region it would be in are people sort of i mean i guess israel is used to this sort of threat at this point its always looming obviously a little more surreal now and real with what happened on october 7th so um what are people feeling over there and what else do you want to add to this well we we dont know where it you know a possible attack could happen theres a lot of possibilities uh as i said you know military installations of infrastructure like a power plant or  something like that certainly a cyber attack uh which really you you know may not have any fingerprints on it uh one thing i would add it was what happened inside iran dan and i know youve covered this and weve talked about it before is there is a large revival going on inside iran where many iranians who after a generation uh of living under the uh the tyranny of the mules uh are turning away from islam and many are and some are turning to faith in jesus christ many times because of a a supernatural visitation uh they see a  man in white they they who they known to be jesus uh so there is an underground church in iran right now and theres uh theres been you know in the last year or so uh a huge uh demonstrations against the uh regime uh tragically a lot of that has been um suppressed people arrested people executed um but still theres a ground swell of uh animosity against uh the repression of this regime and they need prayer too prayer that uh someday therell be an overthrow of this regime that has brought so much uh devastation and death  to the iranian people and to the region and they do have a goal to they have a heimi in the region uh they want to uh have the other sunni nations saudi arabia the uae bahrain uh jordan all of those nations subject to their brand of shiite uh islam the number one goal they have here in the region is to destroy the jewish state uh which is the main obstacle and drive the united states out of the uh middle least uh those two goals are pretty paramount for the regime so to pray for the overthrow of this regime i  think is one thing people can pray about and uh and you know that would be a gamechanger of enormous proportion here in the in the region if that happens it certainly would be absolutely and uh you know chris before we wrap here you mentioned that prayer point right there overthrow potentially of the of the regime um how about how about we how about we wrap this up here with just a little bit of prayer um are there any other prayer points you want to put in there before we go and take it before  the lord and before we sign off here for the for the stream well pray for the peace of jerusalem uh pray for the wisdom for the leaders here politically and military pray for you know a visitation in gaza for many of these people weve heard anecdotal uh reports of some people having dreams and as well but pray that what they had lived under this uh repression uh by hamas for 17 years um pray for protection for the innocents there pray for the release of the hostages uh you know dan if you were  here you cant go very far without seeing some sort of a poster uh you know at a bus stop a small poster a large poster um where you know one or more of the hostages pictures are are up there with their name and their age and um and theres saying bring them home now or let the let them go uh but that the release of the hostages and i think i would pray for the um israeli people they theyve gone through quite a trauma and obviously the people in um um gaza have as well and i i just add one point to your friend earlier that you  talked about genocide you know the pictures come out you know quite uh stark con yunus uh has been destroyed in many ways or parts of gaza have been destroyed part of the reason and and i was able to go there about two months ago inside gaza got to go into one of the territ tunnels uh you know there were about almost 500 miles of tunnels under gaza city conun certainly in rafa uh it was a military base a ter base that was had people living in it and almost every home uh had weapons uh whether it was a karten or a mosque or a  school even a supermarket had uh tunnels in them and weapons uh and so to go in to uh eliminate hamas uh was the goal of the idf to destroy this infrastructure but also try to protect the uh civilians i heard a story about two weeks ago dan where there was a meeting and i i reached out to unra to see about them they havent contacted me back again but the the story was this that about a week after the war about a week after october 7th the idf met with unra and other uh nos and asked if they could establish a  human humanitarian zone so people could go and find shelter and safety and un refused uh the this is a report i had and the report said that uh they felt like unra did it under duress because hamas was uh calling some of the shots and we know more after the idf went in that they found uh how complicit unra and hamas or how uh incestuous hra and hamas were so uh it it the pictures look awful but um but israel has done what it tried to do to eliminate what was an existential threat on their southern border and  while trying to protect civilian lives and yeah yeah and your report by the way when you went into those tunnels was was fantastic and eye openening really and i remember in the early days after october 7th when israel finally went in and they were trying trying to spin again the mainstream media trying to spin that oh israels just putting all these things there theyre setting up a staged video for you to see and you just they just keep finding more tunnels and more tunnels i mean that would be quite an  operation for them to just make all these tunnels and make it a movie set or whatever it was that they were trying to say and so those reports you dont see that anymore they kind of abandoned that after that first one because its so obvious and plain when you see what people like yourself saw with your own eyes going down there and seeing this stuff its its absolutely crazy and horrific um but i appreciate you for going in there and doing that it was really compelling uh stuff to watch and and um and sad at the same time to see  how hamas is uh using its citizens as human shields weve long suspected that and known that and then to actually see it the proof of it is is a whole another thing so all right lets pray here chris to close it up i know its late over there and ive appreciated all the time that youve spent with us here and and sharing your knowledge on whats going on there and uh ill kick it off and then if you want to close it up thatd

       "      <th>[music] [music] all right hey welcome folks milspec ops here its going to be your sitre its 44 2024 were coming to you live here from the monkey lounge in the great state of texas as we get into the deets were going to talk about a lot of different things were talking about this high alert that has been issued uh youve got uh iran basically making uh a lot of bold statements that theyre going to come after not only israel for the consulant bom bombing but theyre also coming after the united states um the  irony in that is uh it just cant make this stuff up its absolutely crazy because the sheer fact of the matter is we are the ones that have enabled all of their military uh nuclear um missile program operations right weve weve weve given them $400 million uh through the obama administration flying c130s in with pallets and pallets of unmarked cash uh all kinds of different things which we know they have used to fund terrorist operations and we continue to unravel and unlock all of the sanctions  that were put on against them to enable that missile program and yet they turn right back around and tell us hey were coming after you just because we dont like you uh you are the infidel right and so anyway lets uh were going to talk about that were going talk about some of this craziness as it relates to this this solar eclipse coming up it makes zero sense were going to talk about uh some biomics things because its a its humorous but its in a bad way um because uh as we laugh we almost  go into a hysterical cry because um we are basically i you it just doesnt make any sense we were going to talk spr were going to talk about uh just the multitude of things that this administration is doing um that shows you that we are not prepared for war uh that we are uh just at a very frail and fragile state that um our enemies have a very short window to react assuming trump gets in now if trump doesnt get in because of some other shenanigans at play that prevent him from coming in um then uh its probably still going to be  game on because uh this administration is extremely weak and um of course we know who is really calling the shots which would be uh ideally thats going to be our deep state okay that shadow government that we all hear about so let me do this im going to jump over here real quickly i do want to point out the fact that um if if you have havent been on this quilt this is an amazing handmade quilt my wife made it i will tell you uh the quality of this thing its heavyweight its um uh its just its art it really is its absolutely  amazing its an 80 by 80 inch quilt uh current bid this is uh were raising money for warrior tradition fund which is a 503c charity uh that helps first responders um as well as uh military uh veterans that uh are suffering from ptsd etc and um but uh the current bid is 2500 which is fantastic 100% of this is going to uh warrior tradition fund so if you want to bid on it you can jump over to monkey works.com or monkey works us.com whichever one uh go into the workshop go down scroll down youll see  the quilt uh click on that and then you can actually get this takes you straight here um and then you can just place your bid and whatever increment you want and uh yeah this is it its signed by me and its got miss monkeyy tag on here and it is like i said youre going to love it you will be blessed by this i promise you its an amazing amazing quilt all right lets do this lets jump over here to uh sky glass as we start off in europe which is a little bit unusual for us were just going to get  kind of a bottom up uh count uh 136 uh aircraft currently up across europe now if i take it over to the conus uh youre going to see were sitting at uh roughly 221 now ive stripped out 112 text twos 35 t38 and 44 ec45 trainers those things are no longer on the screen you cant see them but all you do see are military aircraft including these mil intel balloons that are over the united states and were going to talk a little bit more about some others that are also up that uh arent showing on this so lets  do this jump over into our watch list real fast and you will see theres one well talk more about that thats another hubal just just got airborne and um and then everything else looks to be kind of the norm the ones that catch my i got a couple that catch my one is this gray bird this is uh phoenix air right uh those are agency birds they look to be coming into texas very close to houston and then if we go up a little further you see a lot of air refuelers a lot of navy p8s thats kind of usual uh  that right there thats uh thats not the right picture for some reason it uh just wants to give me something other than what is really in that box but thats going to be your doomsday bird and then that is the accurate picture that is air force 2 so bob marley looks to be airborne and on the move and then as we get over here to europe just youll see a lot of e3 centuries um what you dont see are the german intel balloons they dont uh seem to be showing right now that i dont believe is an accurate picture thats  the swedish and i think thats an intel bird and then this e3 century we go down a little further that uh again if i click on the picture it gives me an awax not accurate um but that is uh one of those italian intel aircraft and then this another e3 century over over kind of the mediterranean there towards cyprus all right lets go to intel and just notice big transitions i see some broken traces off towards hawaii um and then of course i am looking at uh some stuff down to uh looks like port st lucy  florida that uh keep in mind there is a nuclear reactor down there that is always a concern very close to trump all right um other than that it looked like the normal uh and then lets go over here to the awak side of the house and um the interesting piece of this when we talk about tempos there are a lot of uh the same like every this is a 3-day cycle give you an example uh lets see e3 centuries 22 of them all right here we are again 22 uh that looks to be kind of the standard right now weve established from a baseline  perspective and just notice the locations look to be kind of in the same general area they always are uh doing a lot of the man- ine middle stuff united states a little bit different i do see one that headed uh over towards reno uh weve been talking a lot about reno one up to alaska right over texas and uh that kind of covers it so that is going to be awax now lets talk agency boys this is uh uh your gray birds right and just notice uh the flurry of activity down towards the southern side of the um california notice the broken  traces as always that weve seen uh notice this one it goes into montana all right uh thats important when we look at the r135 youll see uh very similar flights uh flight patterns all right and nothing i got nothing over europe or africa all right now lets go here lets talk uh lets talk r1 35s for a minute start off in europe exact same locations theyve always been we just see them kind of in and out of sweden across up to finland this right here tells me theyre looking very closely at at the russians in that that area right  remember these are sidel looking aircraft and so um and then of course uh around taiwan remember taiwan just had a .5 earthquake that took place or 7.4 um but uh then notice that again we just saw the agency aircraft going into uh montana then i see the side looking as they always are in that same general area just pay attention if youre up into in that region okay all right c17s now notice the traces to hawaii are significantly less that tells me that everything that was coming out of hawaii headed over to europe getting deployed  um is uh is already there right probably f-22s if i had to guess east coast pretty busy but our actual number of c17s for a three-day count is only at 216 um versus 371 now the big thing notice the big traces going into uh ramstein look how thick the traces are from ramstein into the middle east and then it was a pretty thick trace that dropped into jalter area there near portugal and spain uh right at that little pinch point going into the med that looks like theyre still doing a lot of air drops into gaza right uh i  see high altitude c17s there and then of course i see little thick traces going into uh bahrain and um and then we get over here to asia and you again will see that uh okanawa up to japan and then australia has got their normal normal stuff as well all right so now lets talk a 60s the number last time we got together 610 3 days right uh well actually 5 days was 1,025 3 days was 610 3 days yet again today is 610 so uh like i said that uh that whole tempo and rhythm uh that happens when it comes to the military  and commercial very similar in nature lot of the same patterns a lot of the same locations that they look and um you can see united states is very very very active and busy europe not so much now if you were having a very large exercise going on as they have told us they were uh you would see a lot more and were not seeing that okay uh which tells me that that exercise is uh thats a front for something else which is probably a spring offensive uh against russia right in ukraine uh try and push them back and  so you can see a little bit of stuff there in asia a little bit of stuff there in australia but really nothing major to speak of so okay back to our main uh one thing i did want to point out lets look at the air refuelers and you will see here domestically in the united states that the kc 135 22 and the b76 uh 7200 pegasus are seven um just note the locations uh florida very heavy uh in terms of florida air traffic what i dont see are the normal we would see uh out here to this texas border okay  and um uh but looks like theyre just getting up and getting active so all right let me hide those and well get rid of those traces um all right now lets get into the news piece of this uh going to talk specifically about this eclipse coming on monday now if youre in the area of this path and you see red or yellow that means that you are not going to see an eclipse that means the cloud cover thats what this is the cloud cover is going to be so thick that the only thing you will see is it go dark for about  four minutes and then go away now why are people freaking out over this particular eclipse i have no idea ive never in a million years seen well i havent been around a million years but you get my point its its just absurd and it makes zero sense unless the mainstream media the mocking bird media has been told to put a fear into people for some crazy reason its the only thing you would think after they saw the fact that this is all going to be covered in clouds almost the entire path from the texas border probably even in  mexico all the way up until you get to the very tip up here where it is green if youre in this green area youll be able to see the eclipse you wont be able to see the totality of the eclipse youll be able to see some of it um because you wont be covered by clouds everybody else you aint seeing any of it in fact like i said itll go dark for about four minutes and thats it so why tell people continue to tell people oh you need to have food supply and water and uh you know all of this other crazy  stuff that theyre issuing these warnings and alerts for states of emergency for an eclipse you think its the only one that has come across uh uh the the the world um in in probably you know our lifetime its just its absolutely nuts so uh check this out speaking of nuts texas do basically telling truckers hey listen were having a standown youre not allowed to be on the road during this time from midnight to midnight the following uh counties and you can see it right here just the county strip where  the total eclipse is going to be uh youre not supposed to have any trucks on the road lets see how many people adhere to that probably not and i doubt it will be en fored but uh theyre putting that out there and uh it just goes to show you how stupid this is right okay moving on from that now this is absolutely amazing to me uh that we continue to allow this and this just goes to show you how how much power people can have right in terms of masses and the fact that they continue to breach the el paso border barriers uh  this is after the one in march where they just all stormed it and rushed it and then the judge let them all go because there are no repercussions because they didnt get incarcerated because he didnt get kicked out of the country theyre going to continue to do it and so um and this is a small amount of people imagine what a very large amount of people can do all right go to sri lanka and watch them take over the consulate there or the presidential house and everything else that happened when that became a failed state uh yeah  you start putting people in numbers and uh there isnt a lot uh the military can do about it all right other than try to contain it so all right were moving on um but a little breath of fresh air this is going to be uh swift air again this is a huge migrant moving machine uh just fyi they are going out of business in about two days um i think it is april 6th is their due date it may be today but i think its april 6th uh that they will no longer be they filed bankruptcy and they will no longer be in operation  that means were going to lose sight of the people coming into our country at least being able to track it monitor it what will end up happening is they will get uh vouchers and theyll put them on commercial airlines like american and delta united uh southwest everybody in their brother spirit whoever they can get them on and theyll just start flying them in and then at that point we have we wont be able to see him other than somebody sitting next to a guy with a packet in his hand all right  okay this uh this is the uh the main story here uh as israel beefs up air defenses they call up troops and basically iran is saying its going to be payback for the syrian strike at the consulant general location and um yeah this is a pretty big deal uh so israel is kind of on the edge of their seat waiting for some type of a response this could actually escalate very quickly this could actually what bring about brings about um isaiah 17 where damascus is no more if israel pushes in uh a nuke into damascus and they uh they decide to  pop something off into israel uh israel is going to take out damascus itll be gone uh isaiah 17 says well wake up and it will be no more so uh there wont be no any fuzz on it where people are like um i wonder if thats isaiah 17 no you will know 100% all right okay now this uh coming from our deep state authority this is going to be the cia actually warns that iran will attack israel within 48 hours uh were down to i guess the this about 24 hours left of that warning now keep in mind that they are also saying that uh iran  is saying that uh they got a beef with us as well so uh stay frosty uh have a plan because if this thing goes south uh its going to be complete chaos people are going to be really uh very confused and dazed if it happens domestically now i do want to point out something when we start talking about these guys we start talking about the deep state if you go back to uh a blog that i wrote in uh just the last month uh its called operation northwood uh northwoods if youre not familiar with that go read  that blog its at monkey works us.com uh under my blogs operation northwoods that is when the united states government decided um that they were going to bait the american people and fake an attack uh it would have been a real attack been a false flag uh event on us soil of a major terrorist attack they were going to have uh everything from airplanes hit and buildings to um you know people just getting shot up all over the place kind of crazy to think that our government could do something like that huh well not really actually  the more we learn about a government i think the more we realize that theyre very capable of this uh and it kind of makes question 911 because this is along the same lines but their whole premise behind that was to spark a war to take out fidel castro right again um this was back during the the cold war this was uh just after the bay of pigs incident happened that got alan doues the director of the cia the longest standing director removed from power and we believe that is why the motive behind  alan doues and his intelligence community to take out jfk all right now well move on from that but uh its uh dont think for a second that theyre not capable of doing something along those lines and blaming it on somebody else i.e iran okay okay here we go this is thursday the 4th and it looks like hes putting on his jams yeah questionable uh we have had her reports that he walks around u buck naked in the white house at night that uh he just uh going out around 2: a.m. looking for some ice cream i guess  but um anyway he does put on his jams i suppose maybe little onesie um but uh you know it looks like hes starting at 10 wrapping up at 5 and hes going to have a celebration of greek independence day maybe hell declare that a day of uh i dont know whatever hell hell declare it for something because the guys just and then hell forget it declared it so all right biden loses swing state uh in the latest poll he loses most swing states in the latest poll as disapproval grows yeah i dont think hes got any real  approval i think uh theyre trying to bake in some some fake approval so that uh if they do something else like they did last time uh we will all uh well at least we wont but therell be many people that believe that he actually uh got the majority vote so um that is if we even have an election but uh anyway you can see uh larry mo and early up here on the stage um yeah lets just move on uh this like a wave of nausea hits you when you see those three their faces just its disgusting okay this this ought to tell you just  how um incompetent the current administration is so they say that theyre nixing the plan to refill strategic petroleum reserve because its too expensive right remember he said well if it gets down below $72 a barrel were going to refill it all um well yeah that didnt happen in fact it didnt get down to that low started 1975 its at its lowest level its ever been lets go take a look at the graph lets just um just throw that out there this is a a kind of an interesting deal uh but this is uh  let me turn off the dot this shows you where we are 17 days of strategic petroleum reserve right there okay look at the bleed off think about when uh that bleed started was uh he came into office he sold a bunch of it to china of all people and then uh instead now keep in mind we are the biggest exporter of of petroleum in the united states why do we not take uh some of that export and refill this right just take it uh you know ban export for 30 days replenish this because what this does is uh if for  some reason we go to war uh and the military needs to be able to keep things going there you go right there again youre basically taking away uh capability uh which is a national security threat to our us military by doing that right there all right intentional folks thats not an accident all right okay lets go back over here so we get into the next piece the navy reveals they have a major ship building delay as global war risk elevates yeah theyre saying hey you know what we cannot uh we cant make what we need  cant get it out in the field uh everything is backed up we dont have the parts we dont have the labor we dont have anything to do exactly what it is we need to do to go fight a war now weve heard this on a multitude of other things right artillery 155 mm uh artillery shells we we just cant make enough of it weve given ukraine everything they had and theyve already blown through it all and now we are short uh stinger missiles oh hey by the way they dont make those anymore so everything you just gave to  ukraine uh guess what yeah itll come back online about two years when ron re uh wickers the entire program because its all been mothball all the tools everythings been sheld scrapped whatever it may be and oh by the way its outdated techn ology so we have to update it to current standards so that uh you know we can actually put something in the field thatll work so thats that aspect now you go back and you look at afghanistan and the fact that we left 12 billion worth of equipment out in the desert that is  still good and still usable and uh and then you basically watch that stuff just kind of disappear into the cracks and it starts showing up in random weird places yeah right this is intent like i said all right you know what i love this right here election day will be christian visibility day uh yeah just leaving im just going to park that right there for you uh remember what uh flashbang just came out and said uh that easter the day that our lord and savior was crucified uh for all mankind that redeemed you and enabled  you to go to heaven uh because otherwise youre not going right theres only one path and thats through jesus christ all right his blood on the cross paid for your sins past present and future in full right comes out on that day and says hey this is uh national transgender visibility day give me a break right and uh here you go and then he comes back in and says oh i never said that i dont know what youre talking about yeah well we kind of got you on video doing it but uh n not a shocker all right hey lets  get into the notams i dont see uh i see a lot of stuff going on i do look like uh look like i see flashbang on the move uh looks like hes going home here uh that starts here i think in two days uh and it goes until let me just click on it um april 5th to the 8th all right so that it goes all the way to thats kind of interesting to monday the eclipse day hm all right well there you have it that is where we are this is all turbulence and slop headed across the drink and then uh i dont you know im not seeing anything  else we did have a a chinese rocket that just broke up over california i dont know what happened to it but uh there was film of it coming in and breaking up across uh california high altitude as it reentered the atmosphere but uh didnt see any boxes for that maybe that was a short live thing so okay cyber attack we get over to bit defender at the threat map at you can see we are being lit up like a christmas tree today um yeah this is uh were getting were actually getting pounded today so uh if youre having some weird  fluky stuff happening thats probably why all right okay bigs army airfield as we get into the deets on whats going on at our at our military installations im just looking for big things moving in and out um that right there is american airlines showing up uh from philadelphia uh looks like a um 787 n uh 900 dreamliner thats interesting brand making new national cargo showing up from homestead florida two very unusual locations we dont see those coming in from that spot to bigs ever all right so  i dont know whats going on behind that my guess im just going to float this out here national cargo out a out a homestead down in florida yeah its probably got a bunch of haitians on that plane im just putting that out there my guess and then it looks like from there uh this national cargo is going to fly over to jackson mississippi and then this one looks like got a delta airlines in there too that is also going to jackson mississippi all right so i dont know that i mean maybe some troops but  im im really thinking immigrants all right all right again you see american airlines delta airlines that will uptick all right because uh swift air isnt going to have they wont be in business running operations so okay do the big thing here just big 747s and then just notice where theyre headed r ze poland all right so again moving moving big big pieces troops i like i said i think uh thats your for operating base uh in uh poland just right off the border of ukraine all right then this keta coming in from cbg  747 thats all i see are very widebody large aircraft coming in and out of do headed over to uh europe all right okay this is ramstein again look at this camber flight going to kuwait from there uh dont see it inbound i see some smaller 737 800 from kuwait uh that thats thats got a military uh no bad aviation uh actually thats not military that one is c130 uh thats probably if i had to guess taken some uh probably taken some of the crim to lm out of uh thats been uh pulled out of gaza sent to kuwait we put them  on airplanes they go to ramstein and then we either send them back to the united states via charter or via uh commercial flight and then look at this one you got a 747 coming thats a camber flight out of kuwait city so um all right well lets watch it middle east seems to be really really up ticking right now okay this is going to be rze poland again this is this is ukraine right here this is the forward most forward operating base from the united states um in in the region of course it is a commercial aviation um uh airport  as well but you can see all the military coming in german air force the brits um let me go down we got camber flight look at that 747 747 those two we just saw leaving or departing go down a little further let me see how many others we have uh duke thats going to be a base commander atlas air coming in from hong kong actually sorry leaving to hong kong from there german air force pretty active folks pretty active thats the brits right there all military um everything i pointed out now check this  out nato to plan a long-term ukraine aid they mole 100 billion euro fund watch for the united states to re wicker money instead of having it air marked for for ukraine aid uh they will probably pump it into nato which nato will then launder it and send it to ukraine which then it will get laundered again and um but thats their plan uh i got to tell you certainly feels like war is in the air okay now speaking of that thats the ruskis right there russia has almost completely rebuilt its military this is  coming from a us official yeah so so while all of us are looking at delayed lead times for manufacturing equipment uh not going to make it in time two years out for uh stinger missiles etc russia has managed to completely get their uh military back up to the level they need in order to go to war so it is almost completely rebuilt thats incredible all right well listen theres a reason why im just going to point this out why why russia is still in the bible when you get to ezekiel 38 gog magog russia  iran turkey three of the primaries there is a reason they are in there and we are not when you see that news i just showed you that their their military is 100% back up ready to roll okay um and then you hear about us and uh were were our spr is at uh the uh 17-day level um you know we dont have uh our navy ships we cant get them made and pushed out fast enough because were having uh material shortages and worker shortages and everything else uh thats the riding on the wall folks telling you its coming  and we are our days are numbered okay here we go this is going to be the brits uh just notice theyre coming out of the united states headed back to the uk and then this one looks to be coming out of uh nova scotia and marsailles so mara is uh thats out of france thats that one right here all right moving on camber flights holy smokes what uh what we got 10 10 10 camber flights and look where theyre all going thats middle east these two are in europe and these probably are pretty much one in the same all headed  same directions but uh uh look at this look at the amount of flights in the air uh very active across europe very active here uh headed down to uh the middle east and then it looks like we got some uh popping in and out of ford hood um that ones going to be alliance uh in fort worth and then this one uh looks to be east coast all right okay omni same thing right headed uh out of the um out of the us over to shannon thats thats going to be troop related then this one coming from okona to seattle that could  be a troop rotation maybe and then looks like another one rolling out of anchorage down to uh that looks towards okona let me just double check that yakota seattle baltimore anchorage to kadina yeah its okona all right okay now lets talk here this is uh this is going to be doha all right um if youre if youre not familiar let me back up the location so you can kind of see exactly where this is a sorry i said doha this is not doha doha is over here this is jaib boti all right uh so were just going to take a gander at jaib boti  and see what we got uh uh this is a lot of commercial flights is what i see i dont see any military that one right there looks uh thats atlas air 767 out of kuwait all right so we do have some troops that have been moved down to this location out of this location so here down to here all right on the board and im just going to see i thats it so other than that jaib boti is clean but it looks like uh that is going to be uh the latest movements all right now check this out i think iraq is getting  ready to start staffing up because of syria because russia iran turkey very heavy presence inside syria given the state of whats going on around there i would imagine um this you think about this military seal of command or or msc uh basically uh the ship loaded equipment bound for iraq and uh says that um a privately owned us flagship under long-term charter to the msc is currently using three shipboard cranes to load 550 pieces of caro cargo consisting mostly of 20 foot sea containers all right uh interesting so  it looks like we are using thirdparty stuff to move um move our equipment maybe its because the fact that we have several of them stuck in the port of baltimore now i think four of them this is what we read so it doesnt end there though check it out us could revoke the hooti terrorist label if the group halts attacks on ships this is absolutely the the dumbest thing ive ever heard in my life um that we would actually go to this terrorist organization and say listen um if you will stop attacking our ships  going into the red sea will take off your terrorist label and um this is right up there along the lines of uh listen well pass this bill if youll stop flying the gay pride flags over all of our embassies around the world um yeah how much you going to pass uh 7.2 billion or trillion sorry $ 7.2 trillion dollar spending bill um if youll stop flying the flag over the embassies absolutely crazy and people take the bait and they go oh yeah lets do it sounds good all right this is doha all right if youre  not familiar with that thats this comes in and out of bahin its in that general area the longest ever runway you can imagine uh you could land space shuttles on this runway theyre just absolutely so long um and uh anyway uh looks like got an atlas there in and out thats cool wait now what i am seeing are a lot more military flights than we normally see in and out of doha i havent seen this in a while uh moose 77 thats going to probably be a c17 c130 atlas air coming in from kuwait and then of course  that going back to kuwait 747 thats probably moving equipment uh around from up north or moving it up north okay they came in maybe to the port there or something okay there you have it and a camber flight coming in from frankfurt again thats doha all right el gora okay this the the only point behind this one is just to show you that the flights are existing they are coming down this is a day ago and um you can see landed down here towards the south um if you kind of get into it this is the red sea right here all right egypt  over here israel right here west bank right there jordan here saudi arabia here so they kind of bring them right

       "      <th>so right now youre under arrest for theft for what for a theft i just explain you have been resisting the whole time no i didnt you didnt even grab me that is hurting and like i said im pregnant stop come here here stop shoplifting is one of the most common minor crimes and while most stores have been a victim of this offense not everyone is clever enough to get away with it even worse sometimes shoplifters get caught and make their situation a million times worse by having an entitled attitude towards the  cops the good news is that these shoplifters receive the perfect karma and watching them being humbled by the cops is incredibly satisfying without further ado make sure youve got your popcorn ready so we can dive into the worst cases of entitled target shoplifters getting away with shoplifting once would be an accomplishment already but we cant see why anyone would be stupid enough to try their luck more than once especially at the same store unfortunately for this one regular target shoplifter today she  would run into some trouble buckle up get comfy and lets see what happens today you were seeing for a while possible concealing items to include clothing jewelry some other items checkout and they wanted me to get you identify so that they can for other incidents and they wanted to know if you concealed any others would you be willing to to open up your pur so i can see you didnt conceal anything so theres items with target tags on those i came in here with that whats that i came in here with  that and just you our body cams on so youre being recorded she has what looks like a underwear or some sort of like an underwear jewelry and like a pair of shoes i dont have no shoes shoes about the jewelry jewelry so every single one of those things has tags on them and when they go back thats a lot of jewelry this woman is caught red-handed by the police with a bag full of her loot and as it turns out this would be her ninth time stealing from this target this time she loaded up on all kinds of  products and pricey jewelry the nerve of this woman is quite unbelievable but it gets even worse from here on out im not going to go to go please so right now youre under arrest for for what for a fact i just stop get off me stop no get off stop no please get off me off absolutely not have he broke my watch oh my gosh please get off me hey put your hands behind your back youre under arrest get off for what youre under arrest for theft just like i told you okay let me get up let me get up no lay down down  put your hands behind your back can i get up pleas hands behind your back can i get up please hey stop your hands resting hey let me get up can i please get up no why len can i please get up listen the more you resist the more things i do thats going to hurt stop stop resisting as soon as you stop resisting we can get you in handcuffs god come bring back im not trying to go to not trying to go to ja i you just ch it today the shocked look on the womans face when she gets told shes under arrest while literally holding a handful  of stolen goods is priceless and were not sure how she thought shed ever try and outrun the cops even with her dramatic escape attempt the funny thing is she didnt even make it to the other end of the parking lot and her hilarious run from the cops was caught perfectly on the body cameras so im not trying to go to jail im sorry im not trying to go to jail go you should have thought about that before you run im reasonable i could have sided you and released you you started this im so sorry now youre  under arrest for obstruction as well trying to run so sorry take a step to your left separate your feet please i dont want you to kick my partner if you do youre going to get an assault on officer charge too im not going to kick please pleas let me go please all right lets walk to the police car im apologize im s i think the throwing of the pepsi on me is not necessary no im so sorry i really do apologize like can you please let me go no i just got out of jail oh my god suddenly now that the woman is  caught she starts being super apologetic but its a little too late now the woman then shares some interesting information this is actually not going to be her first time seeing the inside of a jail in fact its a surprise that her recent unpleasant encounter didnt scare her straight so what im going to do is first were going to grab your index fingers just to make sure you provide us a real name okay jail what were you in jail for before cuz i had two old warant that i just squashed and what were those for um  a duy and um a trespassing motel see okay all right so this going to be the back of my hand im going to p you down make sure you have any weapons on you before i do that can you tell me if you have any sharp dangerous p hazer needles bazookas guns okay back of my hand the cops clearly cant trust a word this woman said so they did an extra check to confirm her identity thankfully the body search goes down without too much drama unless you count the woman hyperventilating and crying in the background her pleas are falling on deaf  ears though and shes about to learn that shop lifting and running from the cops have some serious consequences so why come in here to steal i dont have the money for it i dont know i dont have the money for it do you have a job no can you get a job yes okay why dont you do that instead of coming in a target trying to steal why dont you come in to target and ask for work im i know its not always that easy but sometimes it is all these businesses around here are trying to recover from co so everybodys got a hiring sign  up do you have a drug problem youre may be paying for with these drugs or with these with these stolen items yes okay whats the going right now for like underwear and jewelry and stuff or was that for your own personal use the underwear was my own personal use and then what are you getting for jewelry these days the jewelry i was going to sell it to somebody to for them to buy it for my drug habits how many blues are you getting for like a piece of jewelry like one just one yeah where you getting  that at from somebody that i know the cop at this point was being very understanding after the woman admits to her struggle with drugs the reason behind her reckless behavior becomes clear it also seems like the person whos buying the stolen target merchandise from her isnt giving her very good compensation for her illegal ventures either shes probably starting to regret her actions right about now and youre like i dont want to go back to jail and i say yeah you you are under arrest i can always arrest you and then  you and i have this conversation and then i say hey im going to let you go since you were cooperative in this s but you showed you werent going to be cooperative when you ran and then you threw a soda at me sorry i apologize now i have i literally washed my uniform last night now i have soda all over im so sorry im not trying to go to jail please you guys can trespass me fre here i want to come back here im like well so youre getting that too your trespass from target for life can never come back  okay they also have eight other cases that im going to look at the footage of so far what they said was the total that you have stolen from this store is between 1,500 $2,000 so if thats the case then were looking at possible felony charges for organized retail theft depending on how the prosecutor wants to handle it or each one of those days is a separate theft charge okay go through her bag and see what other stuff is it seems like having that full bottle of soda thrown at him was the last straw for the cop as  they were willing to work with the woman before she turned it into a sticky situation literally the total value of what she stole was a pretty big number and were pretty sure she wasnt expecting to be possibly charged with a felony can somebody pull video to show that whole incident plus us taking her down y ill be able to have all that please im not trying to ja okay okay slide your foot in there for me okay i got to talk to my partner my sergeant all the way over okay then give me a second ill here lean  back im going to make sure i got some ac blowing back here okay all in all the cops were being pretty decent to and even made sure she had the luxury of cool air but very soon shed have to take responsibility for her crimes as they say no good deed goes unpunished and this woman learned that neither does shoplifting if theres one lesson here its this dont run from the cops after youve been called shoplifting the shoplifting woman was charged with assault shoplifting possession of stolen property and drug possession as well as  resisting arrest she also received a permanent ban from all target stores people normally try to act as inconspicuous as possible when attempting a crime like shoplifting from target but these next two women clearly didnt get the memo when the cops arrived on the scene these two were in the parking lot unloading their full cart of stolen goods into their car right in broad daylight could you be any more stupid you guys just took from target no take yeah they just called you just stole from them no  no 91 cy 28 we have returns anybody got an id on them no okay well they just said you took over a th000 bucks worth of stuff from them so you got an id no stop i didnt do push me out of way i push out the way im not doing pregnant okay as soon as the cops try to assess the situation the pregnant woman tries to physically bar the cop from opening her door and this sets off the dramatic and heated debate that followed news flash you cant use being pregnant as an excuse to get out of being arrested and the cops  sal to prosecut her to the full extent of the law and if the charges stick it would be totally justified i did not push you i push the door and you hurt in my arm im not resisting you have been resisting the whole time no i didnt you didnt even grab me that is hurt and like i said im pregnant all right stop committing time crimes while youre pregnant let me go you dont know what i did i didnt youre not being let go all right i dont have anybody inside just stop dont even ask okay can you let be  on the way out can you please let me go im not resisting im pregnant you already did resist once were not i push the door when being impossible to deal with giving the cops a hard time and standing in the way of them doing their job you cannot expect gentle treatment but the claims from the pregnant woman that the cops pushed or hurt her are totally baseless if anything she was hurting herself with all that struggling and resisting exactly and im pregnant can you please fix them now let me go  im not doing i said im pregnant can you please fix the cff now im pregnant this hurting me they loading im moving come from that the dramatic shenanigans of the pregnant lady are quickly getting old and were not sure how she doesnt realize by now that shes only making the situation so much worse she should take a few tips from her friend let me go i cant go nowhere going to our station thats fine do i got a choice at this point you absolutely you do not cuz you made your own choice prior to that even being  strapped into the back of the police car the karen and yes she definitely earned this title continues being obnoxious and even swears at the cops people like this deserve to get a whole buttload of karma and wed expect that the consequences this woman will now face will straighten her out its hard to be that hopeful though i appreciate you cooperating um unlike your im not going to call your friend just your acquaintance im not sure how well you know her but obviously you can see that shes causing problems  shes shes already in the squad sitting thats why youre out here talking to us right now because we dont see the need to dore you on squad car problem well i havt l and i have no reason to right off the bat the pregnant ladys friend is a a whole lot more cooperative and the interaction she has with the cops is vastly different this proves that these entitled criminals have only themselves to blame when the cops start getting rough with them you cant expect to commit a crime and then still have your  own way when law enforcement shows up so what where did this stuff come from to the best of your knowledge well we just get a lot of this stuff out of her moms house like i she said shes moving so her mom stay not too far from here and we just like load the stuff out um theres a tv in the back where that come from from where from target yes okay the woman is able to shed a bit more light on the specifics of the case apart from the tv theyd already loaded the woman claimed that nothing in the trunk was  stolen do you think this was actually their stuff or was this just another cash of stolen goods from another store hey this is your car you said just so you know youre missing two lug notes on one there and one there so be careful i i dont want to see your wheel off or anything like that you know you seem like a nice person so i dont want you get hurt or anything this car was in our town last night we had a f we got the cops showed their caring and compassionate side here the side which most of these entitled and rude  criminals never see here the cops prove that most of them actually do care about the well-being of average citizens and if you just comply with them while theyre doing their jobs youll very rarely have any problems i tell you what im the boss so i im not going to be the one thats going to be handling these the whole case im not going to be you know interviewing you guys again um so were going to have another officer eventually going to come in and talk to you and and uh i appreciate how how straight forward  straight upfront nis you been and calm we appreciate that the cop just explained what most of these thick-headed criminals dont seem to realize cooperation actually will make a massive difference in how your offense is handled resisting and swearing at officers is a surefire way to get the maximum possible charges but youll definitely receive a much better outcome if you simply act like a decent human and comply with the officers request so i understand what do you want you were mean as hell for me i thats i was  thats i was about to say look like i think that we all got off to a little bit of a bad start i dont like it when i see somebody it look to me like you struggling and resistant put of my offic im going be completely honest im already caught i cant be no blunt than i already am im not i wasnt i was not complying its no use arguing with the cops when your obstructive behavior is caught on camera and the cops body cams rarely miss a thing the pregnant woman may not realize this but its not the cops job to be  nice to you the other officers will probably be with you for a little while tonight and just just remember that respect goes both ways that our ill make sure that our guys are respectful to you make sure that youre respectful to us as well okay just half a pet off im just uh i think its my job to make sure that trying to make my my guys work as easy as possible and if somebody is is um argumentative causing a problem it makes our job i didnt say you do im talking about in the future thats why  im here talking the woman clearly seems to be missing the point entirely and her friend actually proved that she was wrong by being respectful to the cops and receiving much better treatment do you think the cops were being fair with the pregnant woman were going to go into the open garage door here in a second you do not have to grab me every time im not going to run bro so theres cameras all over the place du and if i dont then and i get in trouble for not doing my job right and i dont and i  only have 11 months to do this job left and im not getting in trouble turns out the cop wasnt going to be doing this job much longer and this may be one of the last entitled carens he has to deal with that being said its easy to see why hes so excited to be leaving were pretty sure hes had to deal with his fair share of angry and entitled thieves but this woman is one hell definitely remember everybody everybody thats scar of the police when yall so not that is so not true yeah thats what i have come  across many black people that have been very supportive of the police so good for you i support the ones that are nice so you support me you were not nice to me high five knuckles okay see you like me you all right the statement that the woman made could not have been more false and we know that most law-abiding citizens see police officers as trustworthy and helpful instead of being offended the cop still tries to be nice with the woman and makes jokes with her shes in no mood especially considering  her situation but its possible shes just a grumpy person in general both women were charged with retail theft the pregnant woman got slapped with the additional charge of resisting arrest our next shoplifting case takes us to the bellisfair parkway target where a woman was spotted for shoplifting the cop gets the info from the worker and soon enough he sees the woman strolling with a full card of merchandise acting all cool as if its a totally normal shopping trip when she did take notice of the cop she clearly  got the fright of her life being caught in the act lets dive into this shoplifting fail so you said guy with the usa bucket hat what about did you see the guy next to him the i see the guy next to him however usa buck guy he had a full cart left came back in with a shorter about 5 shirt who had scooter with her uh i dont know if she but last i saw she was now lo her okay so usa bucket guy for sure school yes okay card full of stuff yes okay and what he look like other than the usa bucket hat uh one second i want  to say hes probably 5 its the police department stop youre under arrest can you stop her if you dont stop im going to grab on you okay now turn around why did you run the cops learned that this shoplifter wasnt working alone and while they had easily thwarted her plans to try and run they needed to detain all the suspects while the womans dramatic attempt to run away way was amusing it took the cop almost no effort to catch her so what was she thinking next we turn to the male suspects in question  out of the t high fy again its obstru step out of the car was it all right go speak with that off pleas let go face the car put your hands on the car for me put hands on the car im just going to fr you for weapons or ill put you in handcuff okay youre going in handcuff you kept be grabbing a knife and then your hand was on it when i contacted you at this moment the police arent exactly sure whats going on but they know they need to take action the first man wearing a bucket hat is placed into  to handcuffs and since he had a knife on him the cops had no idea if this was going to be a dangerous situation or not with the woman and the man now detained they could carry on their investigation knowing they werent in danger that was perfect can we so we have her detained can we get a total on that yes sir absolutely and then ill work on the usa guy okay thank you thanks yes back barrow can you put your stuff in here you take this off for me okay just face the car put your hands back here i dont smoke but i have cigarettes  in the car by the time the first officer had cleared up details with the target worker the third male was already talking to the cops and the complete story would hopefully soon be pieced together the cops are even nice enough to let the shoplifting woman have a smoke probably because she cooperated very smoothly after her initial run her good behavior now may just make up for her dumb idea of running okay you can step that this going to take because honestly they just need to verify one one quick look at the camera  that said he was only in here grab a scooter and he left thats it g e r o m e j e r o m e sorry you have a midle this show uh j and a date of birth for you8 8288 like for real like i feel like this is too long already like you get a li in your pocket the other suspect jerome is getting more antsy by the minute and were already wondering why hes so on edge as time goes on hes only going to get more mouthy with the cops it seems how is this possible i aint even going the store dude i aint even going the store  james john adam mary edward sam tracy tom rubbert adam charles young mdle are rubber 0170 no theyre just keep doing this while the cop is trying to relay information to his station the male suspect keeps on rambling in the background even if like he claims he didnt go into the store at all its clear that hes complicit in some way and his uncool and anxious behavior is definitely raising some red flags for all the cops f fishy going on here making me sick man good making me sick got all theyll figure out the theft portion  but youre going on your fony warr after all the smart back talk the cops figured out that the man actually had a felony warrant on his name even though they could not yet confirm that he had a part in this shoplifting incident this was enough to put him in handcuffs too its hard to imagine why youd get rowdy with the cops or help someone steal if youve already got a warrant but alas if these people were smarter they probably wouldnt be criminals hey michael what else was the bucket hat so you said it was a usa bu  there was two guys with bucket hats yes so theres a guy that had the like a navy blue buck usa on the front i want to see hes wearing a blue or dark blue or black jacket was it plaid or no i dont think it was he walking with a noticeable like hunch to him as well the entire time okay cuz theres we have one guy with a usa bucket hat on and one guy with a like a navy blue one all navy blue guy had a cart and he put everything in his car so were guessing he stole mhm um so we have at least a female who  stole right in front of me and then well deal with the uh well deal with the male so okay um were arent going to charge the mail on the bucket hat yet until we can get confirmed via video which one it was uh so that stuff will be on video okay ill give you a case number and well go from there finally with everything under control the cop is able to tie up the situation with the store worker as well and open an official case this was definitely one of the most exciting parts of these cops night but thankfully these criminals  werent smart enough enough to make things difficult for the cops hey maam whats your first name sorry i missed it tracy have you been trespassing target before okay heres the deal you dont have any warrants that are bookable but you have some you need to take care of second whatever you stole talking youre going to have charges if its felony forward at the prosecutors office if its misdemeanor send a ticket for theft okay youre also trespassed from target if you return to target and you steal you will be  arrested okay the 52-year-old woman woman tracy is going to be taken to the police station and charged there since shes working with the cops and complying she ruined her chance of ever shopping at target again though while the information was not released the woman was definitely charged with retail theft at a bare minimum on this day the cops were called to a local target for a shoplifting incident where footage captured two women who were engaged stuffing bags full of store items and trying to leave  they quickly split up but what the cops were met with at the scene is definitely not what they were expecting right off the bat the first suspect tries to avoid the cops but as we all know by now this never goes down particularly well stop down there down there stop i swear to guys down there stop down here stop come here here stop im going out there in front of help b help b help babe help me youre rest that for what for what babe help me babe help oh im out with her in front of the for dealership stop put your hands behind  your back okay okay babe help me youre making this way worse for yourself im not biting to do anything youre making this way worse for yourself can i get get up please please cant breathe please turn around let me get up please quick get up please quick making this way worse yourself the 33-year-old really thought that her fiance on the phone would be able to help her while she was struggling on the ground resisting arrest its clear that no one will be able to help her get out of the mess she just made for herself  and its absolutely dumbfounding how long she maintained her struggle against the cops and i went to sierra my fian was at target thats thats youre looking for during a white shirt and and gray shorts tell they they said a female yeah thats her its its its a female she has short hair white shirt great hands yeah thats considering the womans situation and that shes homeless one may understand a bit more why they were driven to shoplifting this is still breaking the law though and the women  would have to face the consequences without running away were going to find out what you stole and what you didnt stole if youre lying to us that theres a receipt on here its not going be any good either way its over at this point so do you really have a receipt on here or do you not have a receipt on here i have a receipt for for part of them and not all of them ill be honest with you all right all right so there is certain things that you paid for and certain things that you didnt yes all right all  right do you want to do you want to pull that up you dont have to show us im just going to be honest with you the first suspect claims that some of the items she had on her were in fact paid for but considering she really wasnt able to provide any concrete proof we dont know how trustworthy this statement was considering her previous erratic behavior well youre going to get more charges resistant so i know sir i really wasnt i really wasnt trying to i was just trying to tell you that she was down there i got that but i was  trying to tell you i i i i apologize i understand i understand hello hey how are you good so we got the one of the two we got the one that had the black bag so she has merchandise and here so she wasnt being 100% truthful with us but she said some of that is hers that she had a receipt the woman seems like a totally different person once shes in the police car and even though shes very apologetic at this point its way too late to try and be cooperative since this ship has definitely sailed brings the car  around backpacks off everything this is what were watching real time saw her outside going to meet her and then i put it together like oh i remember these two cool one day yeah so probably everything in here is what she had i just want to make sure theres no weapons or anything im just i found this the investigation goes further and after convening with the stores workers the cops find concrete video proof of the two women committing theft fortunately for them the entirety of their reckless crimes was caught on  the stores cameras so theyd have absolutely no way of getting out of this hello how are you good is catherine around whos catherine catherine white girl with short hair not that i know of not that you know of i is anyone else in there with you no not that i know of i just got in here i was next door so okay is this just take a quick look were just looking for c i cant give you permission to do that is this your place no its not my place when the cops arrive at the supposed living accommodations of catherine and the  first woman someone else opens the door and like many people in the sketchier areas of town the woman was extremely skeptical and denied knowing anything about catherine at first if shes here boom boom boom summons on her way but we dont find her today she got warrant she goes right to jail so you all right okay i just we just got to leave this a little bit this is almost starting to feel like a movie at this stage and when the cops explain the situation to the woman she suddenly disappears inside  again without a word this was quite unexpected and the strange behavior almost makes us feel on edge what do she do what does she do i mean if shes not like family we cant really say but i can tell you for sure that its its a minor thing disorderly persons thing not the end of the world i think she knows hi catherine how are you hold on want to put that down thank you for coming out we appreciate going to fat you down make sure you do anything just a minor thing at target you know its about if you have any  drugs or anything on you thats going to hurt me poke me nothing nothing nothing all right okay finally catherine makes her long awaited appearance and we can finally put a face to the other half of the shoplifting duo at least shes complying at the moment and this definitely does count in her favor unfortunately it doesnt look like shell be able to find all the stolen goods shed already discarded which does count against her a bit problem is you guys ran hold on tight nobody knows whats going on its  you know like s to said its minor so you know dont need to make a mountain out of a molehill right let your head get in there you have any warrants or anything out for you no okay well things go smoothly youll get released on the summon right this investigation thankfully has a drama-free ending and the second woman didnt put up any fight while being handcuffed and taken to the police station unlike her fiance cant all criminals just be this nice after being detained both women were transported to  jail and both were very likely charged with shoplifting charges it was september 7th of 2023 when the simol county sheriffs department received a call about a shoplifting woman at target who tried to sneak past the point of sale checkpoint points and according to staff shed been frequenting the store at least two to three times daily most likely stealing on every one of these occasions miss latasha shes more than capable of speaking but she did let me know that um she is living out of a hotel right now  shes having a hard time managing and paying for her stuff relatives or anybody here she had her mom was just calling from her from new york she said um you want to chat with her youre more than welcome too i understand i understand all right so bre um are you going to uh i would like to uh prosecute and tresp for this in majority of the time yes she was here last night and she did steal alcohol last night as well she stole alcohol today but those are the most like frivolous things ive seen like that im going to start compiling  on my end um im actually going to oh you mind if i take a picture oh sure the woman is clearly a mom but is shocking is the fact that she was stealing alcohol this is far from the worst thing shes done the cops were about to learn a shocking piece of information that would change the course of this investigation for the worst no dont oh so they have two young kids in the car and a baby in the car okay might as well call the you have your id on [music] you hold on give me one second hey whats going on do you have kids in your  car h do you have children in your car do you have children in your car yes okay yeah yeah hold on let me give me a second im im going to read her miranda ill call you back we learned the unimaginable that even though this woman had a young child with her and was giving the girl the items to try and steal she actually left two young children locked in her hot car one was a young boy and one was barely an infant and its clear that this investigation just got a lot more serious im living in al to im just having a hard time  right now i get it and we all have hard times i know so but we have a bigger issue right now how many children are in your car right now two kids what are their ages my son is 10 10 and my daughter is one one so you got a 10-year-old and a one-year-old in the car thats it okay all right and then how old is she four shes four hi four okay so how many times have you been at this target right here and stolen items i dont remember im not sure so its just been a a whole bunch of times the woman admits that she cant even  count the number of times time she stolen from this target but even though shes now facing a serious shoplifting charge her criminal child neglect is the much more pressing issue we can understand that everyone runs into struggles but this doesnt explain why the woman was stealing alcohol so all right so you are trespassed from this particular target okay if you do come back to this target you will be subject to arrest okay i do have to take a photo of you did you get the vehicle open i can just open  it they got the vehicle open they broke the window its concerning that the womans first concern was if the cops had broken her cars window instead of asking if her kids were okay and this is making us quickly lose any sympathy we may have had for this shoplifter so im going to go ahead leave this car open so you guys can get some fresh air okay all right uh um whats your name um and thats your sister brother yeah going to be in the fifth grade make sure you guys getting some air condition see make sure you guys get  some get some air over there okay like i said the other im wait for the other deputy see what he wants to do and then were go from there okay chocolate p cookie the nice mail cop took great care of the kids and made sure they could enjoy some fresh air for a change and this is the kind of great service wed love to see from police officers after a chat with the young boy and determining that the kids were okay the investigation into their mothers offense could continue because i dont know like how this works ive never been  a dr so i have to take i i dont know like how long im going to be there so they need food to eat go ahad and stand up your hand hey how you doing just come and pick up the kids you are yeah oh im the dance whats your name sorry your name yeah can you tell me what happened um yeah if you want to close the door the cops were being extremely nice to the woman and they even ensured that her daughter did not have to see her being arrested once she was out of the room though the officers placed the  shoplifting woman into handcuffs and thankfully the kids dad had arrived to take the three of them home so their mom got caught steing out of that and so shes going to jail no not steing stealing yeah what what now when you say stealing thats what we i dont know exactly what she took or what she you know and of course this isnt the first time so you know so let me call you right back let me call you right back the dad seems confused and surprised urised by the entire situation and we can expect that  any parent would be quite shocked at finding out their young children had been witnessed to and dragged into a serious crime we definitely feel sorry for this poor guy now let me ask a question what like this is what she stole no what did she st she actually she actually asked us if we could not disclose information whoever was coming to pick up um it it will obviously be public record and youll be able to see it anyway um but this ill just say this isnt the first time no shes never been im saying this isnt the first time out</th>\n",

mean yeah so hes completed the main treatment  program on the unit although hes made quite a lot of good progress and he certainly has been involved in quite a few incidents in the ward um been verbally abusive made threats to kill um really quite serious incidents ill give you ill give you a shot when we need to lock it here and i think the difficulty that we have is trying to reconcile the fact that hes saying he wants to change and that hes keen to continue to work with the fact that hes continuing to engage in that kind of anti-social  behavior lovely mike cheers anti-social behaviour to me im 45 so lets just say ive had the age of 15 ive had three decades of it thats not something you can just discard and put away overnight room werent built in a day youre not mean yeah anti-social at the time behavior to me was my identity it was about who i was you know what i mean yeah to put it down and just say well im not gonna im not gonna be this way anymore it dont it dont happen that way do you plan to get out of here yeah absolutely you know  what i mean yeah uh this this this painting here which i finished a couple of days ago so there was two titles the first one was been double in anguish like a tree in a storm or uh sometimes a river and i opted for sometimes a river it was it was easier to manage john has been in secure institutions for 22 years growing up in zimbabwe he had corrective surgery for a rare birth defect i mean a lot of my friends just accepted me but there was a minority who didnt they made it clear that i was different  unusual strange and that played on my confidence and my self-esteem really you know and one of the ways that i thought id combat the feelings that that produced later on was to drink and that that just magnified some of those feelings that i already had john has a personality disorder and when he drinks he can be unpredictably violent this is a timeline so these are historical events significant events in my life that may have uh had a psychological emotional impact on me in some way this is uh this forms part of the  violent reduction program um so these are highs and lows um so a low for example would be as a child being bullied uh some [music] some sexual abuse and um this is my index offense its the primary offense i stabbed a man several times i spent the night drinking with him i was drinking out of a can in his lounge and i and i said could i get a glass from for the um for the beer and he directed me to the kitchen and when i went to the kitchen i started opening up the cupboards but i completely forgot why i was in the  kitchen and i saw a block of knives and i came back out with a carving knife and i uh and i attacked him [music] they can do a huge amount of therapy understanding their offending history their offense their risk profile but at some point youve got to test it out with reality youve got to be outside the hospital to see how you manage with community life the stresses the challenges of being in a big city like london today john is facing those challenges after decades inside he has permission to go into the local community  without a member of staff its really quite exhilarating [music] being unaccompanied being on my own [music] it feels quite liberating [music] everyones fascinated by the concept of extreme violence murder mental illness [music] the sort of terminology that the news of the world always used was the stop phrase scum of the earth its a very powerful statement isnt it scum of the earth uh theyre theyre very conscious of that our patients obviously want to return back to the community in a safe and  successful way i suspect often the public would wish they stayed here perhaps indefinitely most of them would see them as sick dangerous and nasty individuals we have to in many ways persuade them that what were doing is safe thought through and very responsible [music] i might experience anxiety and i do every day but there are varying intensities and depth to that and most of the time its just you know its manageable its just you know its okay im okay if im okay youre okay were okay were all right random things  will happen thats life it just feels it feels unmanageable thats me my mind playing tricks on me so i dont engage with them stick to my plan what everyone else is doing thats their plan my plan is different my plan is looking after me one of his problems is that when things dont go according to plan or when others make mistakes or when things are unpredictable it gets very stressed very anxious and in the past he has coped by drinking alcohol taking illicit drugs that would lead to risk of violence to  others when i was a child and i did something wrong i was very aware that ive done something wrong but you have that sense of im in trouble and ive been ive been in situations where ive had a sense of being in trouble done something wrong or panic that i have to phone somebody and invariably what i do was i phoned the police john phoned the police in 1998 after he stabbed a man hed been drinking with he was found guilty of attempted murder at the time when the police officer arrested me asked me how many times did  i stab and i in my mind it was once my mind had completely censored the whole event and that it seemed like it was only once but in actual fact it was several it was 13 times hello ugh its helen brousseau here tony is he up and about he was supposed to be ready i think ive got to go through his risk assessment hi mike can you just do us a favor is tony is he out the bethlehem royal hospital treats mentally ill offenders who pose a risk of violence today ward manager helen is getting a patient ready to see his clinical team  they want to decide if hes safe to go outside the hospital on his own [music] oh this happens tony are you decent hi do you remember we spoke about it yesterday its its quarter past two in the afternoon just lets get up and about as i dont think it looks awfully good youre spending all day in bed really so come on lets see some action all right lovely thanks very much mike thats great [music] tonys been in and out of secure institutions since he was 18. hes been diagnosed with a personality  disorder and paranoid schizophrenia tonys got a risk of aggression and violence um when hes unwell and when hes unwell he does tend to use illicit substances and so when he uses these substances he becomes even more risky he has a attack staff on the ward and then when hes out in the community previously hes attacked people when hes been unwell and under the influence of substances oh well we should all have a fight im not glad weve got a total of 36 convictions since 1997. thats quite a high number  oh yeah yeah yeah [music] whats as well going through it [music] hes still quite a risk his parents are quite worried um about him absconding about the risk of violence and aggression the risk of him using drugs on the outside and its only fairly recently hes been using hes been using illicit substances here on the ward tonys recovery is at risk from the legal highs in cannabis that despite tight security are smuggled onto the ward by patients on leave tony has a great difficulty in understanding  the dangers of drugs and of how those substances change his mental state and turn him into somebody who we would consider dangerous to be fur with tony he has been trying hes certainly making good improvements but i think its just a little step too far to give him one escorted leave at the minute you could have done with a shave but never mind so why are you languishing in bed for got no toothpaste on nothing well i will get some we shall organise it why not didnt you tell me that yesterday he has no concept of  the fear that has been engendered in his family um and people around him when he becomes angry or aggressive or violent lets see him then and see what he says so our job is to try and help him understand what what he needs to be before he can get that on escorted leave first of all what id like to say is that in general i think were all agreed that youve been doing really well and were all working towards you eventually being discharged from hospital but i think its a little bit too soon to think of  unescorted the best thing that you can do is carry on with your medication carry them with the groups and the biggest message i can give you is to stay off the legal highs or the drugs yes yeah yeah all right um yeah ive got to pull on through ive got to continue not to ive got to not fight no one um ive not got to get myself into no bother keep myself to myself mind my own business and get along slowly but surely yeah and take it in respect that the people around me are trying to help me and im trying my hardest to cooperate  but there is times i am turning against the staff and thinking oh well should i do what should i do what should i do but when it goes quiet and no one explains to me i dont know what i dont know how to continue you know stay off the camera yes thats right all right well done thank you all right cheers have any of your patients ever gone on to commit serious offences again they have um and i think thats one of the most difficult parts of the job my risk assessment is clearly not an exact science and  we dont always get it right and on very rare occasions patients have gone on to commit other offences so why take the risk of letting these patients out at all dr campbell i think quite strongly that they should be given that opportunity to address their very real mental health problems rather than just pretending that its not an issue and keeping people in prison for however long it would need before the risk was reduced which in many cases would be never you ready yeah all right lets go mate  were gonna go over to the place because of his sentence jamess first trip out of the hospital must be approved by the ministry of justice so for now he can only look at the outside world from the perimeter fence i try and go up there a couple of times a week just to sort of uh [music] prepare myself really for maybe in a couple of weeks when uh my community leaves granted and just familiarize myself with uh just the comings and goings of uh life outside these grounds you know what i mean yeah  a world carrying on you know what i mean yeah well going getting by without me in it [music] a lot of growing up mate over the last couple years but you know its been really hard hard actually facing up to that i used to make excuses for [music] 16 years ago while serving time for armed robbery james made an unprovoked attack on a fellow inmate he was given a life sentence trying to fit in into a high security status jail feeling totally out of place i was trying to sort of uh make a point that you know im not here to be bullied  by anyone i went in a cell with another inmate you know what i mean yeah he punched the geezer up you know what i mean yeah i set about carving the geezer up with a toothbrush and a razor blade id have died in a system i wouldnt have been released you know i i lost everything in the process you know my ex-partner my kids loved them dearly you know i mean yeah but uh you know i was no good to them mate i was i was out of control mate you know what i mean yeah i was a villain i was violent why would you want to be involved in  someone like that and now im here ive been in two and a half years im on a journey to try and uh build someone im proud of and i just dont want to go back to an old lifestyle mate you know not just get out there i deteriorate crash go back to square one again i cant do it i cant afford to do it you know what im saying yeah id rather take the solely approach and ill get it right this time you know what i mean yeah [music] so what have we done today to get you ready to go out um ive had a shower yep um i washed my  clothes last night thats it um ive washed my hair yes im good looking check check mic check check one whos on the mic the version its me madam enemy im on the mic to get you lightly hold on my lady check check my one two three gets out of van sometimes what does um just my my human being you know start being like an idiot thats silly and that makes me after this whoa be careful with that for three weeks tony has avoided taking any of the legal highs that gets smuggled onto the wards ready to go yeah  his team has allowed him two hours out in the local community lets do this you got everything i need yeah but he wont be going on his own escorted leave is the first test of a patients ability to cope with the outside world its something tony has struggled with since being diagnosed with schizophrenia 18 years ago and youre feeling cold no its all right its quite warming isnt it you should see so if you say so he has a long history of absconding from hospitals often making his way back to  his mothers house now you know what i need one-to-one supervision you know what i mean yeah why because i wander off ill go on my own missions you know someones got to stay with me you know i dont mind it though because it helps me out you know yeah its true it makes me feel 10 times better about yourself you know when youve feel like and that yeah in the past there have been physical attacks against his parents tonys turned up at three four five oclock in the morning started throwing things at the windows  trying to gain entry into the house theres been a lot of fear a lot of anxiety and i think at the moment its the first time that his family have felt safe knowing that hes in a secure hospital and that he he cant cause them any more distress i would have made it one once once upon a time but but i felt unwell you know yeah youre getting better now getting better yeah itd be any time two in the morning ten oclock at night um early hour was tony would be walking up and down the street calling calling me and i used to  to block it out try and block it out used to go into the kitchen and stand out in the kitchen so he couldnt have no contact of seeing me what would he show it mum help me help me help me heartbreaking heartbreaking knowing that youve done it youve tried in the power to do what you can lets just start breaking doing this youre just going to be able to tell that im doing all right you know yeah you are youre doing well in that schizophrenia is a chronic condition there are all sorts of psychological  treatments that we can employ to try and help them live with those symptoms and cope with them as best they can but we do have to be always aware that we have our limits to um and thats thats very difficult to come to terms with but maybe weve achieved the best we can but somebody is still unwell is he all right run off oh no i dont eat bacon we have to continue to try but i think its a case of balancing always the risk to the public and it may be that some people can never leave hospital this is what i have to cope with  its a drama whys that drama oh look at these boots you know what i mean that would just thats just theyve got mud all over them mate from yesterday you cant wear those johns been living under lock and key for 22 years i cant wear those mate you know now hes been judged safe enough to take daily trips into the local community without an escort i mean we all struggle in this i struggle i have uh you know everyone has difficulties done weve all got difficulties [music] because i do have like this image thing  difficulty with myself and um is it problematic it has been you know self-esteem confidence you know where i perceived myself you know like in the 90s with a guy with a camera filming me in my face all our image and this was on my birthday and you know and i and i reacted quite aggressively to that i threatened him with a knife and went to the kitchen just because he was filming here not because he was filming me it was the reaction that the other people had as if like oh look at you you definitely got a  funny face looking at your heads like you know the men identifying faults thats what i felt i felt like you were identifying faults you were looking at you know i had problems because ive got no knuckles do you know what i mean so i cant bend them so if ive punched somebody i you know that that thing has been broken so ive used a weapon as an extension of this or um as an extension of my my rage so i might have seen a knife as like an injecting injecting all my fear into somebody else you know  a few days after threatening the man with the camera john committed the stabbing that gave him a life sentence five years before that he used a knife on his girlfriend in a violent unprovoked attack it was a similar pattern i feel trapped and i feel i do feel a need to kind of try and protect myself because i strongly perceive a dangerous threat i attacked her and i had stabbed her and i phoned the police and the ambulance and i was arrested and i spent was sentenced to prison for six years what did you feel  about what had happened i felt appalled i felt appalled and disgusted in myself the crimes our patients are involved with are very serious theyre theyre very tragic theyre often extreme 22-22 because of the graveness of their crimes they wont achieve this thing called atonement which is almost a sense of self-forgiveness [music] our job as a team is to somehow help them bear the enormity of what theyve done and thats a really compelling but also very complicated piece of work i think its about this process you know  its something meaningful and real has to happen you know there has to be like a genuine change there has to be some understanding about you know these these events however difficult they are and painful they are is to understand these why these things happen this is why im in a hospital and this is why im trying to you know make amends in some way the decision about whether james can start to make short trips outside the hospital has been delayed frustrated hes struggling to contain the anger that has been key to his  reoffending liberty proper liberty bruh youve been in more huge shakespeare youve tried changing rules and all that you know what i mean its diabolical its about coming in alignment with what other recently for the last four years very fine with that interference yeah now let me let me finish before we jump on because im left on the wayside time and time again do you know how this reflects one of the difficult things with james is the way that he was treated in his early life i mean a really terrible  history of neglect and abuse one of the worst that ive seen my personality disorders yeah im not liked im not black you know and this all feeds back into like why didnt i fit in one ive been chose part of this team hes not had the opportunities in his early life to develop an idea of how to relate to people and what relationships are for and i think those difficulties have really been closely related to his offending behavior im surfing the urge because like internally i want to scream and shout thats like  part borderline you know its like im just its like but ill just have to just ride ride with it you know what i mean yeah youre like a pressure cooker and this could be the slightest little thing that sets you off and and and youre sort of really um rash you know its like taking a dummy off a baby you know what i mean yeah i could uh just throw a wobbler well i dont want that setback you know what i mean yeah so i just got to refrain myself and just stay calm and just think whatever comes whatever comes comes and it ill  deal with it you know lifes passing me by my you know i mean yeah you know im anxious to sort of just get some formal normality normal life im like a dog at the lead at the moment trying to you know gnaw it off mate i want to get out there and sort myself out even though ive got a lot of anxiety problems but i just want to get out there and get my life back on track mate you know whats up tony uh um im miserable ive got the amp im pissed off and my hormones are playing up um its against my religion  which i dont have a religion but im church of england i was bored want to get a move on you know make a start of things common misunderstanding is that its an easier option being forensic psychiatric care compared to them being in prison i would argue that in fact this is the tougher option when you go to prison you have an end to the sentence the sections that the majority are on here are indefinite they will go on as long as necessary some have been in the secure psychiatric care for decades  and there is no end point oh oh come out of here mate as far as im concerned that i dont even know what im doing here mate aint done me no favors mate and thats why im losing my temper i want to get out of here mate ive got a life to live ive got a daughter to look after this is like being in the in the cemetery this is like being in a funeral parlor sitting here laying and theyre all looking at you im thinking you know whats wrong with this div they want me sent back to prison they dont want to see me go out there  because they know what im like outside im laying on this bed im laying on this bed holding my head together holding all my body together now i mean im suffocating im suffocating in the building how much more they want from me man i cant do no i cant do nothing more can i but im all right ill get for it ive got me ive got my daughter there so ill just look at the photo every day and just think to myself babes ill be out one day ill be out not to worry ill get out of this i just want to get my life together mate  i wish i could walk right now you know i wish i could walk [music] [music] he was 18 years old and it was coming up to christmas and tony had gone to was going to a party he went to the party and then it was about two three days after hed been to the party he was acting very strange um he kept saying or weird or weird things that was happening i thought this aint right this aint right hes its something hes took something he has definitely took something and he said all he could it was help me mum  help me and he just went down on the floor help me mum help me mum sorry i said that we need to come to the hospital the hospital and so i took him up to the hospital and they sectioned him there and then for six weeks and i lost him id lost him tony can be very scary he is voices yeah the voices tell him what to do and he says he has to do it he said i dont want to hurt no one but they they tell me what ive got to do i had to cut tony off for his own for his own good for his own benefit and that its very  hard as a mum when youve got a shutter door on your son that is old no theres nothing you can do youve tried and you tried and you tried and you cant and you cant do no more hes took the fight from me the fight has gone from me do you expect children or your kids or whatever to do well but never happened in his case did it should we make a cup of tea keep it up here get the pill get some piece of pill wake me up [music] james has finally got a decision [music] his escorted leave to the local town has  been approved [music] he hasnt been allowed outside an institution in this way since he was arrested for robbery 17 years ago yes hey finland thats all right no problem no stress eight weeks of non-smoking you know what i mean yeah hes about to just go down the pan oh gosh generally with leaves the concerns that youve got to take into account are the likelihood of the patient disappearing absconding with him in particular thats less of a concern the greater concern is just not really coping when hes out wanting to  return very quickly panicking and becoming very emotionally aroused and just losing his confidence [music] its nice to be able to normality in that guy yeah just seeing the world go by youre not mean yeah away from the ward youre not mean yeah i love it coming up here mate bundles yeah its just different pace of life out here you know at first when i come out was quite bricking it you know felt really unusual im on leave im on tag all the different aspects to it do you know what i mean yeah its like  but you just ignore it at the end of the day nobody dont know who i am what im doing you know im just mingling in like normal people do i am normal you know what i mean yeah ive got personality disorders it doesnt mean im a raven lunatic do you know what i mean its all good mate [music] hello mate did you do any uh pork belly strips you can have a couple of them please yeah do you know what im asking what yeah yeah hang on a second mate yo guess that bag can we check that bag a sec oh thats it  what all freshly done and i thought id lost a lot and now i found it you know what i mean now what a relief mate i feel like im gonna pass out man i felt really stressed to know that i really did let me just get some bit of air mate because i i feel really uh stressed mate james left his wallet in the record shop he visited earlier in the day stress ed so i said oh gosh did you know what it was a testable test because internally i was screaming inside i was ah cheers thanks so much mike appreciate  you matey thank you yeah cheers lifesaver hes got a long way to go before i think hes ready for more extensive community leave and even beginning to think about unescorted leave i think thats a way off he could be moving on the next year to 18 months but i think that would be best case scenario and i think he sometimes underestimates how difficult its going to be yeah hes hes uh not high and dry yeah im going back to the ward now im depressed i want to get back out here my real world get on with my life my  and yeah cheers for today mate and thanks for your company cheers mate as the prospect of being discharged from the bethlehem royal becomes real john has started to look for voluntary work subject [music] volunteering dsm madame are currently an inpatient with the bathroom royal hospital im current i currently have extensive community leave and im currently looking i currently currently id be grateful if you could let me know of any positions you have a terrible photograph youre sincerely send  beautiful this me as a kid i reckon im 13. and with my bowl cut but just i think its uh i think its sad because of like uh you know this kid hes not hes not smoking hes not drinking oh good to see you around how are you doing and where has life taken you see how do you answer that where do you even begin with that where do you even start hi mate i dont even know where to start ive been in the hospital recently mate i had a few psych problems thats for the last 35 years an email letter or two  [music] how do you explain 35 years [music] [music] [music] doctors are about caring and i take pride in the fact that im working with a group of patients who are probably the most dispossessed sideline rejected in society shame and isolation for patient increases their risk if we tackle that effectively compassionately we reduce the risk significantly weve got two options as a society we either lock up offenders with personality disorder and theyre just removed from society altogether or my position  which is to try and get something positive out of these horrendous incidents these individuals didnt emerge from a vacuum they came from families who lived in streets and had neighbours and they very much are a product of society too and i do think we have a responsibility to think about how we support manage understand them to me the options of doing nothing just doesnt make any sense you just got rolled in there time i know i know all right yeah just stalled dont in there yeah but youre all right yeah  tony you you know the rules its once a month yeah okay all right then and ill speak to you soon all right all right love yall [music] you</th>\n",

again so she didnt get hit or anything because of what she was doing the officer grabbed her by her side okay youre more than welcome now like cuz i got to go already um like i  said like i know i mean my daughter has never giving problems and i he was here as a parent it was your kid and they said dad come pick me up im looking for you here and said why i want my daugh to and i got here and nobody would tell me it might be the alcohol i dont know i dont know is that okay for me though what is that okay for the parent to be hysterical and nobody say nothing about their daughter your daughter havent calmed down till now i can still drink it you think ill drink it are you  going to open it open she got it its on you on you buddy buddy youre not my buddy you im not calling you a buddy you ain my buddy either thats another char another charge if you throw up on another charge throw on you your daughter again went for the alcohol bottle again on the table she doesnt drink i dont know what but she had it on her she doesnt i know you can tell me i dont know if she got it from another student the fact that she had it you know what i mean so even right now she slipped out  of the cuffs and charged again oh no was going to happen i dont want her to be obious like picking because i did we the officer originally put the cups on to hold her she was she she not because she was already ling at the principal so she became a threat to the people and that small are im but so the office in which the principal is is smaller than this i know that but can my daughter come on with me right now excuse me can my daugh come on with me right now right now were filling out the paperwork she has being  charged with three different things im going to im going to fight that and i want full everything that took place today thats fine so can am i not to take my daughter already she as soon as they finish the paperwork can you can you just cuz my daughter get you say um real hard to like contain you we are on probation me yeah no no okay why you going to put me on probation no im asking no dont put me on that all right you open that a special p a special a special p not the one on your bag i open this i can take this  off start bring help i want ice you you your eyes i aint going to work do you think i want ice they if shes being hot with you she being even worse with us yeah but i know but im here pick her up im to him we do the finish the paper workk okay once weve done with our people were going to turn over to you but why you you have to be in there everybodys in there staggering because we contacted you an op probation officer so if they were willing to detain her and take her to the jail detain her why because batter school  personnel is a felony its a felony yes soon as you make contact with a rude incident or angry manner to another individual the school staff even if i just slapped your hand its a felony yes okay so thats a felony for a child even for a child then you then she resisted okay cuz she was well she was kicking and pulling well she she slipped out of the cuffs right now right now as we speak where my daughter shes sitting on the chair now okay and you have her handcuff yes but handcuff for why i mean  because shes already expressed expressing to do something more im willing to remove my daughter um so how more pap going to take place i give us another at least 20 20 minutes 20 why youre going to have my daughter hand for 20 minutes yeah cuz you little too tight and you loosen it too much now so like hes been a police officer for like how long and he still doesnt know how the to put on a handcuff or what 74 thats got are real the mother became defensive and attempted to justify her daughters actions theyre  not even tight yes you understand listen to me your your your definition of the safety is not as same as ours so we un handcuff her and she lunges and hits a principal or staff so keep her handcuffed out out of the building once we release her to you shes on handcuffs and you take her okay okay but as long as shes in our custody shes can i go back to them while you do not yet theres not enough room theres so many people why is everybody in there though because shes acting not the way she is  i know you just have to be in the officer come onc everybody does not have to be there she got citation we have two security guards in there two female security guards okay we had the principal and assistant principal and the officer okay thats how many people are in there in that small room or people on yes theyre not on her theyre not touching why so by i need to get out think do you think you give a you dont so you know that so i know what you know that i dont care no i dont give a either you give  a dont theyre all but theyre all verbally like to wrong not shes the one thats more verbal than anybody else shes cussing and making just calling people names and everything she yeah so she shes saying shes calling people hoto shes calling this m no no i understand thats thats the minimal thats not the language i know shes just calling she can get very biger its hard to comment shes derogatory name shes using it all okay so her demeanor itself i dont live with her so i dont know if thats her normal  demeanor no but shes acting out and that shes a student thats why i said i have never had a problem with at this point in time i dont know why shes acting out that way but she is okay and due to the safety restrictions were going to detain her shes detained now and shes been charged soon as were done with paperwork and everything she has poss is going to get suspended obviously from the school im going to from the school but shes going to get turned over back im sorry she is going to get turned over when were done back  to you how long i going to be because apparently whenever i called 911 you were on your way here i was here we already here yes my first my first concern excuse me are you mr lloyd no who i dont know who i thought mr lloyd was his supervisor see its all mixed we dont have a lloyd theres a different thing youre saying jump like theyre just standing there because theyre all physically abusing her and theyre all like nobodys physically doing anything to her cuz my daughter does not rect that i  nobodys touching her if my daughter was like nobody is touching nobodys touching im going to give your mom a copy anyway she wasnt going to fight her youre dumb thats not what happened squaring off you what happened h its remember listen its not your perception if she felt that way thats what she felt no thats not what she felt thats not what happened she might be thinking that in her then thats her but thats her i know i could tell thats her okay but if shes but like my my part is going to be  different or what your part what do you mean like what how much parts are going to be cuz like i can see a lot of documents theres three charges theres three charges what kind of charges okay youre looking battering a school personnel youre looking resisting and the alcohol thats a lot home thats bad home when youre old good huh well the one with the teacher the school personnel thats a felony oh thats stupid but nothing happen with the teacher it doesnt have to happen you dont have to injure somebody it just  has to be do as long as you touch that person i didnt even touch that person she touched my phone i my phone no i had my phone in my hand and she reached for my phone and and she kept trying to reach for my phone i no it in my position you had it right there on the desk but then at one point did she have it with her no she it was laying on the desk like that and i was like let me see my phone and i grab my phone i my hand and she goes to reach and then she kind of getting my finger off and then afterward the stuff is  stuff you can explain okay all the stuff is what you can explain later yeah i mean but right now thats what it is update for mom i just is my mom still out there yeah shes waiting outside im just shes waiting wait but why am i waiting here if you guys are still do i need to print that form out so your mom can sign it cuz youre going to go with your mom the female continued to complain about the handcuffs so when the are you guys going to take these off are you guys so you guys have to keep on the whole time youed look how  loose they are you act like theyre tight no bro theyre tight at first and theyre still on here and its still affecting are you or what guess all you guys are huh theyre not intended for you to be keep moving around oh theyre not intended to be on me where are they intended to be on on why youre asking questions that you dont want to you okay what she talk about stupid cool start cussing out like and what about it hey where the my phone for real hey get my phone your moms not in the building no iu  about hey when are you going to get my phone im going to give it to your mom when we release your tour oh why you just give it to her right now or when she you see her or whatever the yeah yeah you should have raed that like what the are you holding on to my phone that now therere still gossiping theres other stuff going on besides you oh really you think i give a im not talking about you okay shut up who you no dont give a fu about you shut hallway i dont my ears okay do you guys have ears  i go youre right its not that important if you dont care then dont ask the question shut up okay my eyebrows you guys take a long ass i swear what the you guys trying to do take all d no not trying to take any more time than we need to just i bet you guys taking your time for sure thats all you press yes its  finally hey what the to my computer your mom has it are you sure yes finally dont shut up see you again go this is what she had later the females mother called the police department to file a complaint  about the officers behavior this officer he threw my daughter on the ground and my daughters a miner okay i think thats battery to me okay okay so obviously um there has to be reason that any kind of officer uses force and what about a camera should yeah yep is he supposed to have the camera on at all times miners yes correct yes most definitely most definitely also and im regarding an incident that happened on march the 7th on tuesday at sierra middle school okay the things that he did was appropriate  you know getting my daughter on the headlock thr on the ground and having all these other securities like get on top of my daughter one of them was even sitting on top of my daughter okay and i want to know um cuz im sure it be any elses kid and somebody says hey this person threw me down somebody hits me i because they threw me on the ground and i thought was only 13 the officer threw me on the ground i bang my head and sh my knees and then he he continued to put his knee on my hair and then he started  getting me a handcuffs or trying to okay and then he had me like down face first and then afterwards all the three security guards started attacking me okay i want to um a charge on that officer for battering my daughter cuz he has no right regardless of what theyre trained nobody has a right to throw anybody on the ground and have a bang their head and keep their head their leg press on their on their head for what okay whats the reason dirty handup why you got to do all that i can i can definitely put  myself in your shoes there im a mom as well and i would definitely want to make sure that anything that occurred was proper does that make sense and yes another thing that was very startling to me was that the school people they never called me i had a call from my daughter and then they had her in another extra room like when i got there and they were refusing like for me to see my daughter and they were refusing my you know my daughter kept asking for me and they were refusing the female was charged  with battery on a school personnel resisting in minor in possession of alcohol youtube thinks youll love the video on screen click to watch watch now</th>\n",

karen was subsequently fired and asked to leave the property but refused and remained at her desk officers caon and barnett arrived and attempted to persuade the woman to leave but she ignored their orders too she was on the phone and one of my other employees downstairs heard the person that she was on the phone need to stop drinking while on the job okay so we just terminated her like probably

not coming off theyre going to jail the karen was charged with disturbing the pieace trespassing and resisting arrest unlike the law student  this next dumb karen is convinced that laws dont apply to her what are you going to do with my car probably tell her why because you are driving without a license i dont have to have a license that is commercial driving it is not commercial yes it is on january 17th 2022 this anonymous woman had been pulled over after going 54 mph in a 35 mph zone an officer conducting a routine check on pensacola bay bridge came across this vehicle and having seen this decided to pull it over to inspect what  was going on without any idea of the kind of person he was about to encounter young lady officer banks sc brief police pars im point you doing 54 and a 35 any reason for that speed tonight where was a 35 before you got off the bridge and as soon as you came off the bridge all this is 35 i was going 40 i thought nope you got your license registration proof insurance you dont have to have a license to drive car yes yes she did you do not 157 41 with me having been explained why she was being pulled over  the woman doesnt see her fault and when requested for a drivers license she makes the shocking statement that shes not required to have one in order to drive a car now this is something you only see in the movies step out the vehicle am i yeah you are being detained right now step out the vehicle young lady i i am i right either you step out the vehicle i will remove you from the vehicle i know my rights 157 sovereign supervis sovereign citizen did you hear what i said you need to get a supervisor out here right  now no you need to step out the vehicle right now super young lady step the step out the vehicle last time im going to ask you im going to ask im going to ask then im going to make you move step out the vehicle youre going to get me a supervisor out here right now no youre going to step out the vehicle right now you are going to get me a supervisor out here right now thats fine as the officer asks her to step out of her vehicle she denies it and instead asks for his supervisor claiming to know her  rights but does she really i know my right what right is that i i do not have to have a drivers license to drive a car i am not this is not a commercial vehicle okay i know know my right okay very well thats what you want to stick with call a supervisor right now all right right now or else what i know my rights if i dont call supervisor or else what i guess were not going to go anywhere then just hold it for me and go and give me the channel you need to get a super be that can educate you on what the law is okay  this woman is clearly as she claims she doesnt need a drivers license to drive around because its not a commercial car the officer whos amused is taken ab back when she says she could teach the law to him so youre not going to give me a drivers license im not going to give you a drivers license i dont have to give you a drivers license okay im im traveling i dont i dont have to have a drivers license to drive a vehicle okay in what state is that any state its common law natural law okay  constitutional law okay you need to get a supervisor out here i do yes okay her declarations that its a natural and constitutional law in all states to not have a drivers license if youre driving non-commercially are absolutely nuts at this point the officer couldnt believe the audacity of this woman to persistently ask for his supervisor as an excuse to not provide any of her details and calls for his sergeant not long after the officers sergeant arrives at the scene and is put in context of the whole situation  unfortunately for her hes not as calm as the first officer so you do need a license to drive the vehicle and you do have to identify yourself to these officers i i do not have to have the license to drive a vehicle yes you do i do not youre wrong but okay i know common law natural la i dont care about common law youre in the state of florida youre in the state of florida youre in the state of florida doesnt matter in what state it doesnt matter im in the us it does matter so you better hope the information you gave us  comes back is to being you so at this point in time i need you to shut the vehicle off and step out of the car im im not getting out of the vehicle youre going to get out of the car i havent been suspected of a crime you are being legally stopped on a traffic stop you are not being cooperative it is not a ter stop trust me i know the difference you were speeding turn the vehicle off and get out of the car out of the car now undo the seat belt turn the vehicle off turn it off now off unbuckle  so thats it put all that down step out turn my face away from me turn my face away turn around i do not have to have a drivers license to drive a vehicle yes you do no i do not well then you can tell that to the judge if you end up going to jail i do not have to have a drivers license to drive a vehicle i have all the laws right there care i dont care what laws you say you have i know that you dont care because youre youre supposed to be a police officer off this is you should know that this conversations over then  right you dont care about the laws you dont care about our rights thats the problem sadly for this woman her imaginary laws dont apply in florida and shes detained once in the backseat of the car she surprisingly starts asking if she can call her mom can i please call my mother you cannot why because you dont need to call you are you an adult yes then why do you need to call your mother to come and get me from jail since im being illegally detained you will be to call her once you get there can i at least lock my car we will  make sure it is secure what are you going to do with my car probably tell it why because you are driving without a license i dont have to have a license to drive that is commercial driving it is not commercial driving yes it is having asked to call her mother is a clear sign of the type of person she is and how she was raised never taking responsibility for her actions and being always protected from the consequences seeing no way out of the situation her demeanor and complete attitude all of a sudden changes to that  of a cooperative person just be honest sergeant please you dont have a license okay i ill never drive again yes you will because you believe you dont have to have a license ill go get a drivers license tomorrow well wait a minute now you now youre telling me that youll go get a license because youre telling me that i have believe you dont thats correct you have no choice sergeant turner please this is no this is the road thats being taken and this is whats going to happen and if this madness wasnt enough already when  the police ran a background check on her it was revealed that she had a warrant for not appearing in court you failed to appear on the court appearance for what was it expired license so your mississippi drivers license is expired and for the registration okay and the registration so you had a court date that you missed do you remember that no i dont you dont or you choose not to no sir i would not lie to you i dont lie i i do not remember that okay well you do have a warrant out of santa rosa county  so regardless santa rosa county youre in santa rosa county do you not know where you live i just moved here my mother lives on high points when did you move here about 2 months ago from pasola mississippi okay and you dont know what county you live in now after two months i dont i dont thats not something thats i use often what county i live in okay having her story shown multiple gaps her situation gets even worse when the officer checking her car finds ammunition but not a gun wheres the gun  in the car the gun theres no gun in that car seems to be ammo the guns in a pawn chop when did you pawn it like two months ago so why are you still just carrying around ammo i didnt know that ammo was in there whats wrong with carrying around ammo what can i do without a gun nothing all right is wrong with it but if theres ammo normally theres a gun and since the vehicles being towed we want to keep the gun in safekeeping and in a not so shocking finding at this point the officers find a plastic bag of  white powder which to the surprise of no one turned out to be cocaine give me your full name give me your full name look at me give me your full name give me your full name drugs inside the vehicle you are under under arrest now for possession of felony narcotics the woman is finally arrested for possession of cocaine adding to her charges of dui for the influence of alcohol or drugs and operating a motor vehicle without a valid license her face says it all but she isnt the only woman who pretended  to be a lawyer this next karen is lucky to have survived after crashing and flipping it over however she is not thankful for it as she throws a tantrum while being arrested for drunk driving you didnt read me my miranda rides and you also didnt tell me what i was under arrest for do you remember that on august 20th 2023 wisconsin police officers were called to a neighborhood regarding an intoxicated woman who had hit a parked car which resulted in her car

assumed i was operating my vehicle correct what happened to you not talking well dont want talk anymore dear tr to arrest a lawyer the only bar this karen passed was the mini bar for another shot rachel had the right to remain silent but not the ability as she starts grilling the officers on why shes arrested that cop obviously has a lot of patience rachel was charged with ow first and was cited for failure to maintain control unsafe lane deviation  and no proof of insurance and entitled kens such as this next one try to cause a scene by riing people up in order to avoid getting

       "      <th>hello hello its patty joe i am sorry its been like five days four days something like that um had work and i am now a vehicle owning person now i did oh ive just had the motorcycle for a while but you dont go to the grocery store and the motorcycle i mean if youre going to go youre going to go like to like some far off one and you only get like what ever fits in your saddle bags or your backpack not a whole grocery chip so you cant like go to costco on it although ive been known to so got myself a new  car so i now i still feel like i dont have it you know like because even when i borrowed my sons car i felt like i couldnt like drive it places like i couldnt use it frivolously so i dont know its going to take me a while to get used to being like mobile again but there you go and there is some d i about a used car so theres some damage i got to fix it so were going to move into that if youre interested let me know ill tell you what we are on day nine day n i think theres like 15 days of we  were like over the halfway mark all right lets see lets see what durl has to say see what dum dum girl has to say lets go here see record should reflect that the individual known to this court as darl brooks is president okay looking at all his papers got his got his paperback bible good morning everyone i will get started i will call state of wisconsin versus uh darl brooks case number 21 cf 1848 may i have the appearances please good morning judge sue oper leslie bazy and zach wow appearing for the state of  wisconsin good morning good morning sir please state your name for the record im here as a third party intervenor in that matter appearing as authorized representative for my client i set for value and return for value all of the charging instruments in this matter and make my exemption available for discharge of all obligations and charges connected with this case i do not dispute any other facts in the charging instruments record should reflect that the individual known to this court as darl brooks is present in person in  custody in street clothing wearing a suit and tie and a mask for the record i do not consent to being called that name i dont cons to be all right we still have yet to address subject matter jurisdiction the it for the record so for the record has it been proven um mr brooks i stand by the written decision that i issued in this case last week a second copy was please dont interrupt me a second copy was provided to you i know you saw it cu you tore it up yesterday um so im not going to address  it any further you are mistaken and wrong about the law that it needs to be verified or proven um are you talking about the paper i accepted in return for value so with that value return for value mr brooks im going to continue with this trial whether you believe jurisdiction has been proven or not it has not been proven for the record and it has so that detective uh carpenter was on the stand and it needs to be proving and i part of prosecution would like to have him brought back up unless theres any other issues the parties  wish the court to address from the state i did want to address something briefly go ahead um as the court knows from short discussions yesterday the state will be playing a couple videos of the defendants in his statements um the court had previously heard those as part of a motion hearing and im not sure if im really getting the defendant notice or what im doing but i i really tried hard and i im pulling out snippets from this because if the court recalls there are a lot of references that the defendant  makes to prior domestics with erica um his prior record things that the court had previously excluded so im going through and i am um pulling specific time um ranges from this so that nothing that was previously ruled um in admissible comes in and i guess obviously this defendant has the absolute right to cross-examine the witness he has the right and weve offered and we have been um putting exhibits up for him but i do want it to be noted that i would not be willing to have mr brooks just say oh go to about the 7  minute mark um because if he even goes like two seconds before a clip that i had played or two seconds after it could include information that was previously ruled and admissible and i guess what i would say to the defendant is the court has previously protected the defendant um to make sure that things didnt come out where he asked a question that could be construed opening the door and the court said were not going to go there mr brooks and he got the message however with this if theres any portion of this  video thats played that talks about the prior with erica i do consider that that he has opened the door and i will be asking the witness about it so i guess this is maybe more so directed at mr brooks that if he plays clips that um contain that information he will have opened the door hes had this video for weeks at least um this these videos have been he understands opening the door exactly the same as he understands hear say and subject matter jurisdiction he does not understand it he he thinks it should go the way he  wants it only have information that he wants it but the record should been clear and accurate subject to a motion hearing im not sure exactly what accy had ive reviewed the 5h hour video a number of times ive been very meticulous in my timestamps that im grabbing out from here and ious am unwilling to have the defendant put miss gussy in a spot where hes kind of well around this point he needs to give exact times that he wants um started and stopped because what happens is if he says okay can you pause here by  the time he says that 5 seconds may have gone by which may be enough to some of these if i would play two more seconds than what i have here it would open the door so i just want the defendant to realize that this is kind of a slippery slope here and um he proceeds at his own risk and im not going to ask asked miss gussy to stop it at a certain time because i think somethings about to be said um thats on the defendants um and if he opens the door i can um assure you i will i will go into it um so i did  want to put that on the record judge not to be a jerk about it but just once its out there i cant not address it and if its the defendant who brings it out there um into the view of the jury then i going to feel compelled to address it um and then i didnt know if the court wanted to go through the preliminary instruction that you had provided previously on the interpreter my understanding is that mr marquez speaks very little english um if you want to add the um added paragraph that would be fine for the state weve  had very ive had two discussions with him and uh i would not say he is um that english is a comfortable language for him all right thank you as to the first part to what the state brings up regarding the redacted recording i would remind mr brooks the court did enter some rulings previously why do you have to roll your eyes at me lets start the morning off on a good note i roll my eyes at you so i dont think its fair that you should say i roll my eyes i saw you roll your eyes at me im i didnt  roll my eyes at you so dont dont do that mr you did id appreciate a little bit more respect these r let me finish because now youre interrupting me these rulings were entered by the court um to prevent other acts evidence from coming in but a defendant can open the door in a variety of ways these recordings and i have reviewed them previously uh do contain uh discussion and statements by you regarding these other acts and as you heard from attorney bayy she has all of the time stamps to stop at  appropriate time so that the state does not run a file of those pre-trial rulings you can open the door by asking questions by asking for a video to be played um and not knowing those exact timestamps i think its important that i reinforce what the state has just advised you of uh so that when you are watching the recording as all of us will be um if there is something you want replayed and you want to cross-examine the witness about that you know those time stamps and then the state has graciously indicated they would assist  once again in replaying portions of that video i dont need a respond resp from you unless you feel you would like to give a response to any of that with all due respect theyre the ones that want to play the video so i dont i dont understand how im the one opening the door they chose to play the video soine theyre not going to play the entire video though theyre going to redact out probably stop fast forward the portions that this court said would would be in admissible so if you so for example if  during your cross-examination of detective carpender you ask the state to replay a portion of the video and you say go back to around the 7 minute mark you have to understand that you may open the door even inadvertently to some of those other acts evidence coming in so what im telling you is if you want any portions replayed then or if you ask for the entire video to be played under the rule of completeness that you have an understanding that you would be opening the door to the evidence of other acts  coming in potentially ill have to rule on it at that time um but so be mindful of the time stamps uh i dont understand in your honor that thatll be thats almost like you making the ruling and then it and not having any standing if you already made the rulings against them i told the state they cant offer this evidence right theyre the so if you offer the evidence or ask questions that would open the door thats a different story and we all have treaded lightly when youve asked questions that  would have opened the door to a variety of witnesses so the states just simply saying look were going to do our job were not going to put in the other act evidence were going to pause the video fast forward the appropriate spots but if you want any portions replayed or if you ask for the entire video to be played uh then you do that at your peril of having those other acts evidence come in so thats all i want to tell you um he doesnt like that as far as the jury instruction uh do you have any position  on whether that second well i shouldnt say second its the very last paragraph where it says add the following if appropriate do you have any position on whether the court uh reads this entire jury instruction 60 to the jury prior to mr marquez being called as a witness yeah i think the jury should hear whatever need needs that they need to hear do you have a position on that last paragraph specifically sir given the information that the state has provided today youre a stomping in brackets and its  after a bolded section that says add the following if appropriately advise the parties yesterday we would be talking about that this morning hes really reading because his heads moving i mean it was just stated that um the witness doesnt speak very good english and okay brace yourself for the barrage of stupid questions about people who dont speak [music] english oh my god people who dont speak english so that would that would indicate that it would be a lot more work for the interpreter so to  make sure thats not what im asking about sir im asking whether you whether you have a position on whether i include the very last paragraph of that instruction uh to the jury no i dont feel like that needs to be read to the jury i think its pretty its pretty clear from the from all the language leading up to that let me ask attorney bayy a question about um the contact the office of the district attorney has had with mr mark were you able to communicate at all in any way in english even if you would  describe it as broken english yes i think our last conversation we probably said um i said something in english he responded and then when i said something else i think he needed translation for that his primary or victim witness person um specialist assigned to the case is bilingual and she speaks to him in spanish all right given that um bit of information provided by the da and office of the court regarding his ability to answer some but not most i think its appropriate to read the very last paragraph um certainly doesnt hurt  its not going to take away so i will read the entirety of jury instruction 60 obviously the part thats uh says read here if appropriate comes out uh and then um i will print that off and uh that is what i will read at the appropriate time did that print madam clerk quick question on that um this is a dum question how do we know exactly what words uh the witness will be able to understand in english versus thats not how the interpretation works the questions are in english theyre interpreted in spanish what what  works excuse me sir who speaks spanish what words did in english do you understand can you give me a list of them so i can make sure to slip in the english words what an idiot what a dumb question to the witness the witness will answer presumably in spanish uh and then the witnesss words will be interpreted in english and its the english as this instruction says that is the evidence i think its a little unfair that the prosecution has had conversations with the witness and i havent considering that its my witness they  were on the states witness list as well i believe so um its fair for either party to reach out and if witnesses want to talk to either party uh in preparation thats frankly fair game so how how would i be able to reach out to a whitney mr brooks you are representing yourself that uh obviously poses some challenges and difficulties but that is the state and stage that we are at so with that um i know we get detective carpenter on the stand he can come up and be out here uh when the jury comes  out um so come on up sir i will swear you in again as is my practice when theres a witness on the stand for a second i have one more thing real quick um well it needs to be other than subject matter jurisdiction so what is it you didnt even let me get to it i said what is it i said it needs to be something other than subject matter jurisdiction can i get to it theres no way to know what im going to say if i cant say it mr brooks please tell me what it is youd like to address i i would want to address why my um icfs  have not been addressed because i know you have them why have i not getting copies ive gotten copies of every other icf why not the the recent ones sir i am not uh going to be the intermediary anymore for icfs that are directed to the uh clerk of court regarding copies thats not thats not explaining why i havent record there something you want me to address then you should address your icf to me and not the clerk of court well where is the where is the icf if i sent it i should be able to get a  copy ive gotten copies of every single one whether they were for that from the clerk whether they were addressed to you or whether they were addressed to the cler of courts ive always not going to address that further mr brooks im not going to be the intermediary when you have questions to the clerk of court so whats the point of me sending the icf me doing what you asked me to do and sending them and then not being able to know if theyve even been received and get a copy of them which ive been getting copies of ask for a  copy of the icf they dont have any obligation to i addressed i addressed it when i first sent it i asked you on the record did you receive it mr brooks i didnt receive anything because nothing has been sent to me if theres something that you need then you should reach back out to the clerk of court were not going to take up court time regarding an icf sent to the clerk of court again i will advise you once once again i did this the other day if theres something case related it needs to be addressed to  me if it has to do with the record it needs to go to the clerk of court and it was it sent to the clerk of court the but i still should i still should be able to be told if it was received and get a copy which youve done that before every single icf and i told you i would no longer be doing that sir because of this very issue ites you say so now it changes so now it changes all of a suddenly no it didnt change all of a sudden and you know that so dont try to does it change all of a suddenly all  because ive been getting copies of everything ive sent which is what you asked me to this changed last week and you know that it shouldnt change i dont im bringing the jury out and im not addressing this issue so i want i want the copy of my ics that i send um send the request to the i dont have to send her another request wheres the one that i just sent last week all right the jury is going to come out so please be respectful i i will but at the same time you still have to i did what you asked  me to do if tell me to do something and i do it and then now youre saying im not going to get a copy which youve been providing them ever since ever since you told me to do it youre making my mr brooks the rules on that changed last week no no it did not im still supposed to be able to say if its been received or not so why should i have to send multiple icfs to even know if they theyve been received thats ridiculous im going to give the parties the um final version of journey instruction 60  which i will be reading at the appropriate time come on you cant change stuff at the last minute you as me to i did it as a courtesy frankly youre not courteous me im not even not even im not even refering refering to the fact im referring to the fact nobodys gonna do you a favor if you are a big poopy head you are a youre a horrible monster and then you expect people to bend over backwards for you that you havent even enough respect to tell mece to the jury theyre coming out okay that doesnt that doesnt uh mean  that you shouldnt be able to tell me if my icf has been received icfs that you told me to submit you told me that you told me that that is a gentleman of the jury you will disregard the commentary by mr i accept for value and return for value this document just like youve been hiding everything from the jury that they the jury will disregard the court is not hiding anything from the jury yeah you are so mr brooks please be respectful of the jury theyre coming out you should be respectful you are  addressing issues that are not related to evidence are you actually do something please and then now it changes everyone can be seated thank you this is ridiculous just like subject matter jurisdiction hasnt been proved for mistrial just like youre making judicial determinations that you dont have to prove anything by law hold on which is a tacket agreement by you your honor ladies and gentlemen of the jury the please disregard the statements currently made by mr brooks incorrect st ments of the law prove that theyre  incorrect prove in this case wheres the proof wheres the legal proof and you need to disregard them because you dont have it and we are going to continue with testimony mr brooks i warn you do not interrupt i dont identify by have a discussion about whether you

got to read to you before i kind of get your side or hopefully get  your side here and love to hear your side id like to know what the rail has to say about okay you know we got some people calling us saying this you know um he said you made under this before no i wasnt driving someone thought you might have been he had to get that warrant you ended up calling a guy just to use his phone kind of loitering around and just you know how you end up how you ended up kind of being thats what they say no no no i was going to say i i i knocked on his door to use his  phone y right but it probably wasnt him that called because he got his phone but someone was concerned about something so just trying to figure out whats going on down in that neighborhood does that make sense yeah okay all right he kind of you know like i said i probably that wasnt probably the best but i was just like i need to get a uber i have money on my cash app card yep so im not trying to rob anybody im not trying to break it and obviously you can tell im not drunk im not you know i was just trying to escape from  the scene of my last crime yeah uber under the influence of anything so okay all right um what it was okay all right um in regards to these derell then do you understand that you have the right to remain silent just answer everything with a yes or no yes sir okay and then i just write down your reply um you understand if you give up that right anything you say may be used against you in court yes sir uh do you understand you have the right to consult with an attorney and have an attorney present during any  questioning yes [music] sir uh do you understand if you cannot afford an attorney one will be provided to you by the court yes sir understanding the above rights uh derell are you willing to speak with me us primarily me im the one thats be doing most of talking probably uh i just want to know a little bit more about whats going on just a little bit because like i told you i know very little i just know that you know youre down in this neighborhood someone called you know they didnt know what you were  doing down there and things like that so i got limited from their side but im looking to see you know what you have to say about it im looking to see you know maybe maybe a lot of maybe the caller was just on some bs down there you know i dont know you know i dont know but but i cant i cant really show the court that if i dont have you know if i havent talked to you so thats why im here just to kind of see what you got to say about it get your side of it you know running around a neighborhoods not  not the end of the world its not a huge deal right right right right unfortunately i wouldnt had to do that if if i made better decisions with women yeah but not going to point the finger sure im a grown man i make my own decisions so yeah you are you got going point the finger in nobody i just yeah didnt think didnt think yeah what the hell you want to speak me not right [music] now not right now so was a decision made to speak with mr brooks the following day being called their name leading the  witness the objections are overruled the witness may answer yes maam it was now when you spoke with the defendant on the 21st what did you have some general information as to casualties from the yes i did what information did you have at that point at that point not all the information was in yet but i knew um as i stated in previous testimony um our emergency department was very full um i knew there were significant injuries to many people um i knew some were deceased i did not know the exact number at that  time you had um approximately another couple minutes of conversations with mr brooks before you called it a night um was he what was the vibe that you got from him during those couple minutes objection i dont consent to being called that name is leading wi the objections overruled you may answer i would say friendly i think when you heard the the clip there um mr brooks jokes about riverside and football the ind ual he was talking to at that time was detective stern um as you cant obviously see him in the video  um i could sense i believe you can hear it in mr brookss voice in that clip um the fbi put him on edge it was unusual to see them i could sense the nervousness he did transition as i talk to him more throughout that clip into a more normal conversation tone again but when i was speaking with mr brooks casually throughout the night that was the type of tone um he had with us it was very friendly and he seemed when it came to myself in detective stern very comfortable speaking with us now you had  stated your initial intent was to talk to him about loitering in the area that he was arrested do you recall that objection spe to you over roll the witness my answer yes i do did mr brooks at all talk to you about the loitering in terms of what the focus of your investigation was that night objection i dont consent to being called that name leading the witness overruled the witness may answer yes the statements he made in there um you know about you know being in the area because he needed an uber um  you know he he says more you know to us about not knowing the area walk he doesnt know the streets things of that nature and he just needed an uber to get home um so yeah that was that was his reasoning for for being down there and he stuck to that reasoning the entire time direct your attention then to the next day so strike that that night was he transported to a moso police department yes he was and did you go to moso police department yes i did um did you transport him so it was a dual transport uh officer  lea from the walkshop police department responded to walk memorial hospital in a in a marked squad car that has a uh inappropriate rear back seat transport compartment mr brooks was placed in that car and myself and detective stern followed in a separate car so that comment is very important for them to say and get on the record um theres very little that you know they have to like guess say validate but appropriate transport of people in custody is huge the entire i dont know people call it unrest and some people call it riot and  whatever that happened in baltimore after freddy gray is specifically and directly because of the way police transported that person and did not secure and even afterwards there are people in um what they deemed at one time to be appropriate transport with the person cuffed and then if it the if the van stops short and theres somebody even after mr gray who hit their head on the front of the of the back of the van and was hurt i dont know if he was killed but id have to look into it but documenting and putting on the  record that they had to go in two cars and the reason was so that he was in an appropriate vehicle to be transported is actually something that really needs to be said and and validated by by the police because they do transport people in compromised um positions that they cant def you know would be able to help themselves or stop themselves from being injured have you not been you know restricted in those ways specifically handcuffs and specifically hand behind your back so important tiny little fact but important  once you get to c police department do you do anything there objection leading over roll you may answer not the first night myself and detective stern stood by while some basic medical questions that were part of moso police departments policy as far as holding a prisoner were asked of him um i was there until mr brooks was placed into his cell once mr brooks was in his cell i explained to him that i me personally would be returning the next day to speak with him more and give him more information about the investigation did  officer lea end up staying at the moso police department with the defendant objection sply to you overrule yes he did why was that objection hows that overruled that was mosos request being mr brooks was although so because of the transition and we did not have our own municipal lockup facility um we requested to use moso police departments and they allowed it but being mr brooks was technically in our custody they requested that one of our officers stay um there to do the monitoring and the jail so did you return to the city of  moso police department the next day november 20 seconds um to speak with mr brooks again objection i dont cons to be quot over ruled you may answer yes i did did you return with anyone um i returned with detective bener now what was the plan for this interview you had said the previous day the intent was to kind of start very low just looking at loitering um did you have a plan going into the interview on the 22nd objection leading overrule i did what was that planned so the plan was was different  from the prior day so the interview with mr brooks on the 22nd didnt start till about a little afternoon that a that afternoon 12:11 p.m. to be exact around 8:00 a.m. that morning there was a briefing with all officers that were involved where i learned some additional information um one of the things i learned that morning was that there was a domestic abuse incident that had occurred between daryl brooks and erica patterson something i was not aware of when i was with mr brooks during the evening hours of  november 21st um there was also much more information at this point in regards to the parade incident um as i had stated in my earlier testimony it was very very chaotic that first night um between radio traffic and what i could hear going on down in the downtown as i had stated it was really unlike anything ive ever been involved in but by tuesday morning the 22nd we had narrowed it down to basically just mr brooks that there were not four people in this car we were looking at one man so he was now  a suspecting the domestic abuse and driving in the parade so i chose to begin the interview on the less serious matter that being the the battery charge that he was looking at with erica patterson now you said tuesday the 22nd um monday excuse me okay thank you and um what do you try to do when youre meeting with someone do do you try to establish any type of rapport with that person is that helpful you how did you approach this interview on the 22nd objection leading im also st us to the form of the question it was actually  compound if you could rephrase how did you approach the question of mr brooks on the 22nd objection i dont consent to being name witness my answer so when i began to speak with daryl brooks on the 22nd um i began with some very light conversation i explained to mr brooks that i had more information from the previous day i explained to mr brooks that his girlfriend at that time erica patterson had made some domestic abuse allegations against him that were physical in nature i didnt indicate to</th>\n",

       "      <th>every time i come my brother be retired highway patrol 33 years every time i come since we served her this every time i come over here my brother escorts me over here m so im scared for my safety and shes crazy shes the type that will say that i hit her h the cops have been coming over here about i bet theyve been coming over here two three times a week there different things that shes done destroyed my house did you see the riding on the wall no the mattresses were in the way the girls were even on  my side at the restraining order place once i showed them my video her spray paint in my drive my car for oh my god i cant believe theyre not arresting her no maam theyre not now its going to be even worse shes going to retaliate even more every time she gets served with something she tears something up breaks something in the house see how she spray painted the house i got her on film im telling you stop painting my house how long you been with the s uh the scambia county huh how long you been with county about 10 years  do you ever know bane matthews he retired he might have retire i mean was retired before you hired on we are here in escambia county florida because this kindly old man care for a coach for a no thank you opened his home to a young woman when he finally asked for rent she became abusive and destructive while working on an eviction which takes time a judge has helped escalate the process by issuing an injunction against stalking due to her behavior effective immediately stuff real quick [music] [music]  hey got that paper i think he gave me the wrong [music] one [music] should be the non written one yeah this one i receive a handwritten one whats that why did i receive a handwritten one uh sometimes the judges do that then before they get transposed on the [music] computer okay so there was yeah see the differ [music] in so you still have the court date on the [music] eight there is that [music] okay okay so on the so the court date in the meantime the is its going to be a temporary restraining order okay um so  there is priv actions on here listed no contact among him is one of them and then cant be within 500 ft of this address so how much stuff do you have here um well okay right there in the driveway is where his rv was and he moved it so he could go stay somewhere else and how much stuff do you have here though cuz you cant be here for the judge part of the terms that you guys work out on the eth is he was just told to f umig mhm whenever this was delivered so this is only temporary um thats why he took his  rv yeah until we work this out so what im saying though is this is temporary okay eviction is permanent okay up until the court date these terms are in effect at least until the court date and part of what the judge says is is the not within 500t well that is my address too that does make sense what do you [music] mean took all my stuff in go like he took his rv so un unfortunately i cant give any good input on that but judge says you have to be out of this house okay until at least the or when  now does it say right now yes where when we when i mean on the paper where does it say when its ordered it say done and ordered order and adjudicated judges saying you cannot be within here okay so got to be a certain amount of time long enough to get your stuff and go okay and thats not a problem mhm i just want to know what you know what time i should be theres really no time frame i said its its when you get served you have to get yourself and vac for the temporary say that where exactly whenever you get serve and have  to make it r w because its you cant be within 500 here so once you are ser saying what it doesnt have a time correct so does that mean 24-hour notice no its once once youre served technically i mean and like said that im not trying to be a dick about it but technically you are violating in terms of a restra or by being here right this second so like i said its not an issue of getting all your stuff just have to get it and go thats unrealistic though what do you mean just its just un unfortunately thats  the terms of of a temporary or permit retraining order or in this case the injunction for against stalking so how much stff do you have here that you need to get out um itll probably take me 3 hours to get out okay def cant be that long so i like ill try to shorten the time but i need to make some phone calls cuz im not just going to get in my car and start driving to nowhere well in the meantime we going inside grab some things and you have to get out no problem i need to make a couple phone calls first okay well i need we  need to pack up a few things and make the phone calls in the process do i lets see that sounds great and good im going to do that um but im going to sit down and make a couple phone calls first i dont have that much stuff well how much stuff do you have um im trying to work with you here of of to trying to get all your stuff out so you dont have to deal with anything later on right um same so i mean honestly if i was i dont really have much more than like some clothes and a couple dressers  you know lets lets st inside and work on that im going st outside and make a phone call so i know where im going but lets step inside and pack your stuff otherwise we dont have to give you the chance to get all your stuff out im im trying to work with you here so if you want to make a phone call im fine with that lets go inside make phone call file an eviction it doesnt matter though that he can still file an eviction in the meantime the judge has ordered you out of this house okay so theres i said two options  we can come in here calling somebody first okay then youre not going to go go back inside one or two no cu im im not trying to be a jerk about it i dont think you can prevent me from getting my stuff or making a plan to have somewhere to go youre sitting here debating it with me as a problem im telling you to go inside pack your bag while you make a phone call to to call somebody make a plan and then and through with it it doesnt matter about plan you have to get your stuff and get out of the house thats  fine so but im a plan to know where im going before i get my stuff no thats not what happens that doesnt that sounds it doesnt sound very that doesnt make a whole lot of sense like no the judge says you have to be out of the house so you got to get your stuff get the house now or not im not going to sit here and be ignored so is that what you want to do because the other option is going to jail for making a plan yes if thats what you want to call it yes you use whatever word you want or word the  whatever way you want or use whatever phrase you want i dont care youre not getting out of the house so get yourself and get out of the house or you go to jail thats the two simple explanations to it this is a sered dvi signed by the judge okay you have to be at this house he says thats fine so we can go inside and get your stuff and get out or you can go to jail im not going to sit here and stand there and debate this with you at your door so are we going to go to jail or you get your stuff get  out ch im looking some things up okay im not here for you to look things up i know youre not but i like this this isnt definite so correct its a temporary order until your court date so you have to be out until your court date so you can look up all you want thats fine but im not going to sit here and debate this with you in the doorway debate whether or not you know where im going you dont have a plan for me do you no thats and im not trying to be add its not your problem right correct so the judge says you have  to be out of this house so you have to be out of this house okay but were not getting out of the house so like i said were not im not going to sit here all day and do this do you have resources sleep on the street i just want to know where i should go i dont care where you go all im doing is telling you thats not my problem though the judge says you have to be out of this house im here to tell you you have to be out of this house im trying to work with you on it and trying to get you get your stuff if you dont want to  get your stuff thats fine but you are going to leave this house thats fine but im going to make a plan first no

hearing uhhuh for um my roommate is filed stalking on me for anyways well today this officer come knocking on the door at the same time with my roommate okay but and told me that the judge ordered a temporary injunction okay and that i need to leave right away okay so so i told him okay well i need to make some plans some arrangements okay you know  um and basically he was like no you cant make any arrangements you just have to get your stuff and get out who is she to you just a a good a friend that i helped out a long time ago um anyhow just someone i helped out through the knowing her and then she didnt want to pay rent and all the other stuff so i started talking about evicting her getting rid of her and she just got crazy later problem you know so i got on my phone to try to you know attempt to make some arrangements first right and he ended up  and just went from b door did you tell him you werent going to be leaving right now i just said i wanted to make a plan first okay and so why didnt and i asked him if he had any resources like right make a place to okay all right well i guess he he was under the impression that you said something about you werent going to be leaving today or at least right now and he said yeah you are you you need to get your stuff and you argued it for 10 or 15 minutes and then i guess you that when you got on your  phone um well while we were talking about it yeah okay and then what happened after you got on your phone he pushed his way in okay and tell me tell me the story of what happened from there i mean he pushed his way in i mean and tried to arrest me okay and what happened what did you do i mean did you turn around and let him put handcuffs on or i asked him not to and i asked the question that shes getting charged with this time uh the violation of the order cuz thats thats the whole reason we got into this  because she wouldnt get out and uh resisting officer so just two uh misers hes got a felony hanging over right now for ass salt and battery on her stepdad yeah well they may bond for that then so like i said steve uh uh roberts a good friend of mine and he already told me says you know shes got such a past criminal record uhhuh that if she does anything yeah i got you no i have no idea and shell have a bond i dont know if theyre going to revoke her other one but theyre shell have a bond for this you got any questions can  i still make a plan for somewhere to go no youre going to go go to jail now why cuzz you fought with the deputy so how so what do you mean how so i mean how you you didnt do what he told you by gathering up your stuff and getting out of the house so youre violating the injunction and then when he came in and told you youre under arrest you didnt go quietly and peacefully you fought back so you get charged with violating the domestic violence injunction and resisting an officer that i just received mhm cuz that injunction says  you have to vacate the house right now and by not doing it youre violating that injunction wasnt even given the opportunity the same one that showed up to give it to me is the one the resting yeah because you werent going to get your stuff i dont have a problem getting my stuff but you didnt do it you argued for a while and then you made a phone call i just had questions okay well you didnt need to ask questions you needed to get your stuff thats what he told you get your stuff and then you can ask  questions after you do that but you wanted to argue and make phone calls and thats thats why i was problem want to know where im you know make a plan on where im going whenever i pull out of here with my stuff okay all right um im going to go take care of this and then well head over to the jail and well have some well have a crime scen person take some pictures of the taser mark okay all right hang on a bit the suspect was charged with violating her court-ordered injunction against stalking the homeowner for  refusing to leave

       "      <th>i never thought that these words would leave my mouth but squatters are kind of trending right now i guess i mean it seems like everywhere i look i find another story about some group of people who have illegally moved into a vacant house usually in california just saying usually in california but todays story is the most ultimate twist to this whole squatter situation theres a handyman out there named flash shelton who has found a loophole in the law where if he becomes a water by moving in with  squatters then he can actually get them out of the houses where they are squatting 12200 homes have been squatted in the city unfortunately some of these squatters have gotten pretty sophisticated its just an incredibly confusing thing to think you go on vacation somebody somebody trespasses and enters your home starts living in it and then you legally cant do anything about it like call the cops and say somebodys in my house hi my name is flash shelton im the founder of the united handyman association and i also  opened up squatter hunters.com where we help people that need to get their squatters out this is a lot of process theres a lot going on here lets get into it so this all started in northern california theres a guy named flash who were going to talk about here in a second his mother was trying to sell her house i guess flashs father had recently passed away so the mom moved out the house was sitting vacant she listed the house on the market to try to sell it and one day the real estate agents showed up to the house house to  go do a showing or whatever they were going to do and they arrived to find some people who were living in the house and the house full of furniture so they call up flashs mom to say hey who are these people who are living in the house and shes like i have no idea i didnt rent it out to anybody well thats when the mother reaches out to her son flash and says hey can you help me out here i dont know what to do about this situation in general what you read about online and what you hear about online is  that if youre stuck in a situation like this where squatters have moved into your house especially in california then its going to be really hard to get him out because you cant just go there and tell him to leave you cant call the police because normally the police arent going to be able to really do anything about this so from what i understand it ends up turning into this whole thing where you have to go to court and file a bunch of paperwork and you basically end up needing to evict these squatters almost as if theyre  tenants so anyways flash does all this research himself he determines that yes it looks like these squaders probably do have rights they probably are allowed to just occupy this random house but if these squatters have the rights to go just squat into his moms house then why wouldnt he have the same rights to go just also start squatting there and kind of like use that as a tool or a catalyst to help get the squatters out i called lo local law enforcement and as soon as they saw that there was furniture in the  house they said that i had a slatter situation and they had uh basically no jurisdiction and they couldnt do anything so i you know i dissected the laws over a weekend i basically figured out that until theres civil action the squatters didnt have any rights so if i could switch places with them become the squatter myself i would assume those squatter rights this is a very creative way to look at the situation to say the least and he actually took it a step further and gave himself even more  rights than the squatter had because since this was his moms house flash was not an owner of this house at all so what he did was he drafted up a lease between his mom and himself so now he was a tenant of his mom whos the owner of the property which like i said that gives him even more rights the law would prevent me from physically removing them however um being that i wasnt the homeowner i had more rights as a tenant i would actually have more rights than them so if um if they were there then i  would have just entered the home with a le in hand i would have just shown him the lease i would have walked past him and said you know i dont know what youre doing but im moving in this is my house now and i probably would have just done anything and everything i could to make it miserable for them so that they left on their own all he had to do at this point was go out to california and move into the house now id be a little bit freaked out to do this if i was him because if someones squatting in your house then we can  probably assume that theyre not in the best place in life like at a bare minimum theyre probably broke but who knows they might be a criminal they might be on drugs you really dont know but flash is a savage he doesnt care he goes out to california he parks his car right down the street from his moms house and he kind of just stakes out there and watches whats going on for a couple of days and pays attention to like whos coming and whos going and stuff he does start to notice that theres some trends and theres some  people who are usually leaving the house in the morning hours so he figures maybe that means that those people are going to work or whatever so one morning he decides to make his move and move into his moms house while the squatters arent there you know id like to say that these are not people that are homeless theyre not looking for a place to live in all of the cases that i have worked with so far its its a criminal type its a self-entitled group of people that um that the laws are allowing to go in i mean its its its  like this because the inter the interpretation of the laws the way they are that were never intended to allow people to take over residential maintained properties in the first place is telling them that they can move in even when somebody goes on vacation in in a situation ive dealt with um move in theres no fine theres no penalty theres no restitution now hes gotten inside which wasnt all that hard i mean he has a key to the house but once he gets inside he discovers stuff all over the place in every room like these  tenants legit fullon moved into the house their stuff was completely unpacked and everywhere and he spent the next couple hours just changing the locks installing security cameras putting in an alarm system and he even put the utilities in his name at this point his plan is fully in motion like flash is a legal tenant of his mothers he lives in the house hes all settled in hes even receiving mail here at this point he wanted all of this furniture and crap that was inside of the house gone like immediately were talking the  same night and he came up with kind of a unique strategy on how he was going to get all of this furniture out of the house quick i saw a couple young guys across the street big strong guys i walk over and im like hey you know do you guys need any furniture and theyre like yeah im like well look i said i got a house full of furniture over here that if she doesnt get this stuff out by midnight tonight um you can if you help me get it out if you help me drag it out to the driveway its yours you can have  absolutely anything you want for free and theyre like sure awesome you you know so so i already had um them lined up so now weve got living in the house like not even a full day but he fullon lives there like he has moved in and settled in and at this point hes basically just waiting for the squatters to get home so he can confront them these squatters did get back david was sitting there waiting and believe it or not theyre actually pretty chill when they came back i just laid it out for them told them that it was all locked up  cameras and the only way they would get back in the house is if they broke in on camera and i would prosecute and i told them they had a day to get their stuff out or the furniture was not theirs anymore really sorry about all this i really am its just it its a nightmare beyond ive got guys scheduled to come take the stuff out later today so but were going to lad by lad take it um out of here okay well um yeah i mean i have at this point i have no choice i just need to i understand i i i would i would  be in i mean i was overwhelmed by the amount of stuff when i pulled in here when i pulled in here yesterday i mean i didnt expect all this yeah so thats my thats my fault that that is all of it i should have paid better attention thats beside the point we just need to get it done and tak care of because it was so just the right do what you can to get it out like i said i mean i i have to start putting stuff in the driveway and so that i can lock it up because once i leave youre not going to be able to get  back in you can tell that this lady is a good lady deep down inside she probably just came on to some hard times if youre in that situation and youre facing some hard times theres probably better things to do than just move into some strangers house the situation reminds me a little bit of that youtube channel called soft white underbelly if you guys havent seen his videos check him out he basically interviews all kinds of people who have fallen on hard times just like gotten into drugs or  became homeless or whatever and what you can tell if you listen to a few of this guys podcast is that the people that that hes interviewing might be considered like bad people on the surface but deep down inside a lot of them are actually good people with good hearts that maybe just got wrapped up in the wrong group of friends or maybe just grew up in the wrong neighborhood so this initial story actually came out about a year ago but its getting a bunch more attention now because for one theres just a bunch of squatter stories  that have come out recently and for two flash has been doing kind of like a bunch of press or whatever lately like hes been showing up on a bunch of news channels and talking about his services that hes offering which well talk about here in a second check it out some of those clips that we watched today was from flashs youtube channel its called outside the box with flash go check him out if you guys are into this type of content hes posting a lot of videos especially lately but if we go to  popular and we look at this one this here is the video that has gotten him the most amount of attention for sure its called how i remove squatters in less than a day this video has got a lot of people talking its got over 25,000 comments like this one here says what boggles my mind is that when someone loses their home to the bank police and sheriffs are present to evict the homeowner but they wont do anything to evict the squatters who are not even homeowners this guy says that its a joke that criminals have more rights  than law- abiding citizens which i agree like im trying to figure out who out there in the world is giving these squatters rights like i cant really imagine on either side of the fence republican or democrat or whatever like what lawmaker is thinking that is actually a good idea to give squatters rights i dont know if you guys know let me know down in the comments but i have no clue who would be in support of this dad lifts 007 says if you break into an empty house its a felony if you bring  all of your stuff and stay the cops cant touch it got it theres a lot of people who are saying flash great job for staying so chill especially because he was going in here and kicking people out who were taking advantage of his mother who was grieving at the time and what im gathering from all the people showing up in the comments who are realtors and attorneys and stuff like that the consensus seems to be that if any of us are in a situation like this in the future where were going to have  a house thats going to be sitting vacant for a little while we need to put all the right precautions in place like putting security cameras in the front and the back side of the house you should make sure that no one can just call and put utilities in their name without having a special pin code or passcode and its a good plan too to just have your neighbors engaged and make sure that they know that you own this house and its going to be sitting vacant for a little while and if they could just kind of keep an eye out for  you that could go a long way too now i wasnt able to figure out what flashs full-time job even is at the moment his instagram says that hes a public figure an anti- squatter activist a squatter hunter founder of the united handyman association and host of that youtube channel that we looked at earlier treat them like what they are they are trespassers until you give them rights theyre trespassers theyre not squatters people trying to squat arent actually squatters until you empower them lets get your squatters out he has  this website squatter hunters.com and this page is dedicated to basically anyone out there who has squatters in their house and they need help you can actually go to flash through clicking one of these buttons and hell do a zoom consultation with you and hell actually maybe offer to help get those squatters out of your house by doing the same thing that he did with his moms house if we go to the about tab we got a little bio about flash which we already know a good amount about him and look if  we go down here he actually has a team like flash is one of the removers he has this guy dylan whos also a remover and then he even has this guy mike hired who does i guess just investigation and research probably to figure out like maybe who these squatters are or who the owner is or what the laws are in that particular area where theyre going to remove the squatters because that is the tricky part about what hes doing is the rules and laws are going to differ for sure based on where the house is located  flash also does have a gofundme which is to help contribute to changing the squatter li i dont know flash personally i dont know anything about this fundraiser so im not telling you guys to go and put your money into this or anything but i just wanted to put it out there that hes raised 10 grand already hes looking to raise 25,000 and apparently this money is going to help rewrite the laws that would allow law enforcement to basically do their job and get squad ers out of homes faster seems like thats the general idea here  so yeah check this thing out if

       "      <th>and by the way now youre taking a picture of inappropriate pictures of me because of what i am wearing so guess what now im really compliment police on you its that time of the week again that sacred time of the week where we take a look at the entitled and insane species known as the karen kicking it off today were going to be taking a look at a karen who threatened to sue someone after being recorded trespassing on their property because as we all know already a karen is just never in the  wrong no matter what they do but without further ado lets check it out i got a phone call from my lawyers dave howd you come on my property no i didnt i sat in the car youre videotaping me you want a phone call oh your mom saw me across the street and stopped would you like a phone call from my lawyers thank you eliza for coming by steve im gonna call i told you once leave me alone theyll come near my home or its considered harassment and here you are darcy thank you for coming by steve im  calling the police on here and im calling my lawyer wow i think that might be a first in a karen video instead of calling the manager like your typical run-of-the-mill karen shes taking it a step up a notch and calling her lawyer instead that must be the busiest lawyer in the entire country theyre probably getting about 50 phone calls just in the morning alone lets be real theres no way karen has a lawyer i dont think anyone who says that on what seems to be a normal basis is telling the truth her  version of a lawyer is probably her friend whos watched like two episodes of law and order once while half asleep but she is wearing what looks like a law hoodie so maybe she is the lawyer who knows steve im calling the calling my police how dare you im not online im not on your property and by the way now youre taking a picture of an inappropriate pictures thing because of what i am wearing so guess what now im really calling the police on you cool you wear it outside and come by my house with the intention  of coming by my house with the intention of it your bolts should know better your bolts should know better guess what now im really calling the police on you well i guess this karen isnt that different after all shes dialing 9-1-1 now with about the most caring reason you could think of in this situation inappropriate pictures of her because you know you totally wouldnt have to be wearing something inappropriate in public for someone to be taking these pictures of you for a person whos wearing a law hoodie and  says they know lawyers thats gonna be the stupidest reason she could have come up with here the funny part in all this is that shes fully self-aware of what shes wearing here as well and its up to think that she could have genuinely ruined this guys life if he wasnt recording all this also for a little bit of context by the way the person recording in the karen in the video have a little bit of a beef going on and karen has apparently been recently harassing this dude whos now taking it upon himself to record her in  the act you know better come take your sign come take your side of my pr i knew you did it eliza i knew you did it i knew it i knew it the away from me get away from me dont you ever come by my house again stop where you are stop where you are right now dont you come near my house dont i said stop you keep coming closer i will call the police you keep coming close ill call the police eliza get off my property is this your property get away from me you came over here with the intention of taking  pictures and video of my house i dont give a what you did you came over here intentionally to harass me get the out of here i blocked you get away from me get the away from me get the away from me immediately eliza get away this is out of your realm this is out of your realm im not on your property you came to the wrong house eliza the wrong i dont care where you were what i know is a post somehow you can see that i blocked you and you show up at my house to take pictures who are you call the police next time you aint an  investigator you know goddamn wealth you know the law so well you know what youre doing is wrong im not doing anything you know what youre doing its wrong this right here all over for everybody to see that you go around the peoples homes and do what you just did not interested not interested we are on our way to cbs youre on your way to my house youre on the way to my house it came from that road you passed cbs from your house to get here the out of here get the out of here good good when the cops come  ill be sitting there this is why everyone should always have a hose ready in front of your house i really do wonder what exactly the other karen is saying to the police at the moment also part of me thinks she just happens to own that hoodie and another part of me thinks that she might actually be a law student which if thats the case with 1.5 million views on tick tock i dont know if thats gonna last much longer shes only harassing someone also not to mention the public indecency and of course indecent exposure which i think  we can all agree on all right so i have an update on karen i got a call from the police and as a courtesy they said im not doing anything illegal and theres nobody pressing charges but long story short they said that yes she filed the police report to try to pin me to sexual harassment um and her intention which she spread already around her friends was to try to get my you know livelihood taken away based on what i do for a living and with that she called the police this time because she wants the video taken down  and the cops said theres no legal action that can be taken at this point not at least by them and um so theyve kindly asked me to take it down just because listen theyre going to keep calling the police and calling the police until it comes down so i havent decided yet if im going to because i think at some point everybody has to you know have to be accountable to their actions as of right now the video is still up on tick tock with a juicy 1.5 million views which i think is the right decision  considering these karens are going as far as to call the police accusing this man of sexual harassment when in reality you happen to be wearing i think the smallest size shorts you could find in the kids section of a walmart even if the video gets taken down the damage is already done this is more than enough evidence to use if she actually does go to a lawyer which is not out of the realm of possibility considering shes a karen a stay away from the other people you hear me you just stay in this chair get  the out do that again ill kick you out myself yeah i just thought id throw in this video i had to get my weekly dose of karens getting owned this right here is a level 100 karen slang master in the flesh you could tell this is just another day in the office for him i feel like every single business needs to have a security guard like this present at all times to slay cairns that would make every place easier and safer for everyone get the out but anyways i think thats gonna wrap up todays video  thanks for watching drop a like if you enjoyed the video stay tuned for some more juicy videos coming soon to the channel and until then stay sexy peace</th>\n",

       "      <th>on june 17th 2022 law enforcement responded to a report of a domestic disturbance at an apartment complex upon arrival they encountered a male individual and a mother of three who

situation during their discussion the man discloses that  the woman is his ex- partner and they were engaged in a heated argument he further alleges that she has been physically aggressive towards him in the past although he claims that he did not retaliate based on the information provided by the man it appears that the root cause of their altercation lies with the womans actions is she your

attempts to explain to her that in cases of domestic issues law enforcement is authorized to enter her residence and conduct an investigation however she remains steadfast in her belief that she has done nothing wrong its a domestic related issue but he does not have right to search my things or my home without my because you have kids here we have to  check their wellbeing thats great hes alive

questioning the female then inquires about the whereabouts of her exs bike initially she does not respond but eventually provides the necessary information enabling another officer to retrieve the

wristwatch she is currently housed at the vucha county jail a nine counts  including aggravated battery on a person 65 years or older robbery with a weapon possession of synthetic cannabis with intent to sell possession of controlled substances including oxycodone and amphetamines among other charges following this videos events robbert and chelsea were both booked into jail and chelsea was charged with one count of felony child neglect while robert was charged with culpable negligence of a child chelsea posted bonds 6 days later in the amount of 2500 robert was able to post bond after only  one day in the same amount they both eventually pled no contest to the charges chelsea was sentenced to 36 months of probation with special conditions including mandatory drug testing grief counseling a

       "      <th>[music] we are at the miami seport its one of the largest uh trans shipment of in the united states for cruise as well as cargo we had a vessel arriving from uh dominican republic which has been a very hot route for us lately very high risk for itics so we sent out a team of officers all right lets go as you see this vessel is huge lot of little areas uh that are vulnerable for narcotics to be smuggled in we look at every crevice on the ships we found drugs everywhere that you can imagine any type of  material that they can use as adhesive stick them onto the the hle of the ship to the interior of the ship on the containers themselves got anybody down the hatches aside from narcotics we also look into uh anything that has to do with human smuggling stow wass or anything like that that are trying to come into the united states there you go what is that its right there its a pretty big load i just got a phone call from the team on the vessel they found what seems to be bricks attached to the vessel were  going to bring it back to our shed and see what exactly what we got going on they uncovered nine bricks could be any number of narcotics cocaine heroin or meth the trend lately has been putting magnets inside of the the tape in order to allow them to attach it somewhere on the vessel where we normally wouldnt look that secure it to the underside of a metallic structure making it much more difficult to find d thats what we want to see cocaine hydrochloride that sort of meets the trend that weve been  seeing now were going to wait we have nine kilos now that weve tested it we know know what it is were going to notify hsi uh theyre going to start gathering information and start an investigation any day we find narcotics is is always a good day were were keeping up the fight keep your eyes open for this one this has a lot of stuff from paris and france its a really high-end flight people have a lot of money on this flight uh you can get a lot of currency here you can get a lot of merchandise a lot of it  so this flight if youre focusing on just merch here on the custom side we focus heavily on the merchandise the currency and just making sure that you know everybodys doing the right thing as far as declaring [music] goes whenever somebody buys high-end merchandise abroad outside the us and they bring it back into the us if their residents here theyre supposed to pay something whats called duty to the us government and thats basically taxes in the us instead of the other country that you purchase the item from hello sir  passport a lot of bags whats inside coffee close any high-end merchandise no nothing perect guys did you do any shopping in paris today sir yes i bought one little ceramic hand for5 okay there you go brother take care man did you do any shopping i did yeah did you declare anything i didnt have to declare anything it wasnt over we have to abide by the rules and a lot of people try to avoid it so how much did you spend out there 3,000 you guys are exemp $800 3,000 over the amount but you know were out there to you know get  them if youre walking around with a louis vuitton box youre going to get stopped why because you got to pay duty we have a person of interest coming in today we have inel that they have purchased very high-end merchandise in paris thanks man it thats it were going to see if theyre going to tell us the truth and declare the items and if they dont they might run into a penalty or or even the government seizing their items where are you guys coming from today vacation 15 year anniversary congrats guys you are residents of the  us right yes all right were going to fill out these customs questions well get you out of here all right yeah sure important question any purchases you made any gifts coming in you would declare right over here yeah i got some louis vu nice all right yeah so so any highend merchandise you would declare there you have to pay duty on all this stuff yeah citizens you know so i hope i hope thats good i am you know trust me and thats it right yep all right i just have to tell you if the government does  find anything else we can seize it okay all right bring your bags this way guys got to see this watch its yours for you sir yes beautiful is this gold yes thats a cattle when they buy a rox they just give a cattle you i was like thats it thats so you spend 40,000 on roox and they give you a candle oh i dont know souvenir where are the lou in there lou are glasses first so all the lou for you maam yeah you didnt want a rolex ill be honest with you so very few people tell me the full truth and  you did today i did the calculations the rates are so low that with your exemptions it washes out but if you had lied to me lets say it turns into a big penalty or thousand you know i get li every day and when i dont i get happy so telling the truth goes a long way theres special formulas we have to calculate the duty so ill watch was 90% free the amount of duty was so minimal only about 30 40 bucks that its officer a discretion to charge that duty so he paid no duty because i think people who tell the truth to that extent  should be rewarded thank care guys thank you once again you made my thats it right now were at the location we call an intake its the invisible line where mexico and the us feats thousands of people come across throughout the day so we do the best we can to get them [music] out my team is going to be sweeping all the cars that are here weve been getting small quantities methamphetamine cocaine so they might send two or three loads 10 kilos at a time hoping that if one load gets taken down the other two  will make it through another thing we watch out for is the spots they work for the cartels like there are people are watching us right now as he on the phone that would be a great a spotter doing is mon activi land somebody else they have a good load theyll send two or three spotter vehicles ahead of it and maybe two or three behind it the front team comes through hey theres no dogs theres no rovers up here its good to go theyll send their load through and then the people behind it are sure  hey our vehicle got through nobodys following it were good to go this black suv over here hes got a saint engraved on the back window of his car so a lot of the smugglers they pray to their saints to protect their load of drugs from us they usually find them around the vehicle or a lot of times theyre hung around their neck it doesnt always mean that theyre up to no good but its a good start so were going to check this guy out you going to sir going home yeah all right can roll down the water hes got  another little religious icon on the dashboard of a vehicle you doing you see mother the one that were always looking for is the paton saint of anaros which is mal its like the modern day robin hood anytime we see see that icon around their necks around their reiew mirror we look further and more times than none we find something in the vehicle hes nervous hes very nervous so hes going to be referred in for more intensive inspection you got so i gave him his instructions on how to drive through the x-ray machine he told  me he already knew how to do it so that tells me hes been sent in before so other people thought that he looked suspicious xr didnt find anything so well do an immedate p down now theyre going to do what we call a seven-point inspection well check some of the areas that are common to be loaded with [music] contraband but if there had been bundles inside there it would have showed up as a solid wide [music] mass in these kind of vehicles we have a very large void in the firewall you can put 6 7 kilos in there once they close  it up it looks like any other vehicle theres no tampering its good we didnt find anything so well run a dog if theres nothing there then uh the gentleman will be good to go [music] he finished his inspection the dog didnt show anything but well keep him in the back of our head thats it hes good to go all right okay you guys pop it open one of the advantages of the seaport is the opportunity for bulk smuggling here you can put a large amount of contraband in any number of these containers my team here is designated to  check containers coming from drug source country pop the container making sure that the commodity thats in the container is what was manifested good okay right now were in our federal inspection area and were going to be working the this container uh its coming in from source country it has bananas in it so were going to be uh deving 100% and were going to x-ray it and do our [music] inspection and were going to run uh each pallet to our through our x-ray machine the officer the operator is  going to be uh looking at the image uh just to make sure there is no anomalies within bananas in the past we found uh they put drugs in between the flaps so basically what we do is we probe all the boxes to make sure theres nothing inside so we go through the whole box we go through the whole bananas make sure feel them make sure you dont have any plastic bananas anything fake if you see anything that you dont like then we examine it more like good example this one feels a little weird get the knife  well everything feels you know normal in this one it was probably a little hard because it was green but it felt different than the rest so when we have something like that thats when we go ahead and inspect the deeper all right so we just uh finished our inspection of the bananas everything looks good there was not nothing found within the shipment so were going to be releasing the bananas it could be out on the street uh later today how you doing maam can i get your passport please where are you today  dubai dubai yeah did you do a little shopping out there yeah i told them i got a necklace which is about $800 all right thank you maam all right sir let me take

just look while i search you bought some gold that for my nie how come you didnt declare this you bought some gold how come you didnt declare this i dont how much is this that a gift for a kid thats ,500 dollar yeah so total together is how much you tell me that $469 its a lot of  money thats thats a gold i thought its okay no no i mean its okay to bring in but you have to pay duty all right its not going to be so much gold is only 5 and 1 12% 5 half% 5 and 1 12% theres food in in here right tie it up no no no dont cut how do you want to open it you want to open it how you put back in its not in here you tie again yeah its fine i got to go to atlanta georgia i must stay here all right sir you know what happened two days ago theres another passenger coming from cambodia right so i opened this bag and  he had crickets in here oh yeah and then he put it in his mouth right in front of me oh you eat crickets yeah why not oh my god if they stand in here they might do that too i dont know i got to open some of these all right okay do your job thank you thank you sir whats this seeds what that oh pepp black im just going to ask agriculture if its allowed in the us all right is this okay black pepper he said what this yeah its good yeah all right sir youre all good here im just going to calculate the duty until then you pack  up all right so he bought some gold over sees its about $4,000 hes a us citizen so he gets a $800 exemption the next th000 is the automatic 3% rate so were left with 2469 at gold rate which is 5 1 12% thats 13 5 plus 30 all right sir your duty is going to be 165 okay well go to the cashier get you out of here i think he was unaware that you were supposed to declare this stuff when you bring it back into the us so he paid duty 165 bucks and he was out the door so make sure you declare any expensive  stuff next time okay thank you sir here in cbp maritime smuggling distruption unit we have been tasked with working here at the seaport to conduct walkthroughs and search any and all inbound and outbound vessels were getting ready to do a boarding on a vessel thats arriving from dominican republic were going to meet a few miles out get on board do our inspection we target specifically based on the country of origin dominican republic is considered one of the hot spots for narcotics trafficking all right lets make sure we  focus on the actual structure the outside first okay this is what we call a walkth through we look for all small crevices anywhere that theres space or any area thats hard to access for every single ship is different and the bigger the ship the longer it takes for us to be able to do it now see some of these things like this got to get underneath the drug trafficking organizations they always have the upper hand cuz theyre the ones hiding it were the ones trying to look for it its always a cat a mouse game always  always trying to you know catch him but skills and knowing where to look and how to look is a big deal when it comes to this hey m we checked this area here too hatches were opened were going to go inside we have have a couple of areas that need to be checked thats got a a hatch usually theyre locked and theyre not locked crew coming down if we can get in it anybody can get in it so we got to verify make sure theres no contraband narcotics or whatnot [music] good yeah were goodone good today unfortunately we didnt find  anything well make our way back and were pretty much done all right come on lets go all right we do this often its hard work but its fun and its rewarding when you actually find something you know its a good feeling graas good morning anything to declare to them where you hit it okay look like there was some modifications done to the under carage of the car so were going to go ahead and do an inspection on the vehicle right now and see if theres any tampering uh done to the vehicle that would show signs of of  having some type of illegal narcotics in the vehicle okay bingo packages about an hour ago cbp intercepted a vehicle the driver she was very scared very hesitant to talk to us looks like its laden with 7 to 10 keys of what we think is cocaine one tool we do use is what we call a control delivery what we do is when we gain the cooperation of one of our violators well use them and attempt to deliver those narcotics to another individual in hopes to further identify the narcotics organization and further the  investigation as a whole uh whats the 20 of the target vehicle the agents were able to build a rapport with her and gain her cooperation and we were able to get the driver to deliver the vehicle to its destination and were waiting to see who comes and picks it up at which time well arrest that individual and if he cooperates well try to deliver it to the next person the whole idea is to move up the chain take down the initial driver or take up the pickup individual hopefully thatll lead to a stash house  where more narcotics are stored the higher you go up in the network the more key players will identify and that paints a bigger picture of the network and which cartel theyre associated with theyre sending us screenshots of the text messages with the cartel oh man theyre telling her to go back to waters right now it looks like were being tested by the organization or the cartel we believe that they have counter surveillance setting up watching the vehicle theyre telling the driver to go back to mexico of course we cant let  that happen so well come up with the reason why the driver cant so what were going to do is inform them that the vehicle wont start we have their product that is their money theyre going to do whatever they can to come get it so well try to work that to our advantage and push the envelope till someone does come to get it [music] [music] hi how you doing can i see your passport miss sure where you coming from today oh nice girls no luggage sir hold on are you alone yeah where are you coming from maam im  coming from india why so many bags ah because i went to wedding my two kn beding all right its a lot of bags so i have to check come with [music] me how long were you there i was there for 3 weeks okay so youre declaring 6,000 right yes in clothes clothes no jewelry right i have my own jeel i went to the wedding so how was the wedding two weddings how are they good you know how indian weddings are right long right its a long i enjoyed it is this gold my granddaughter gave me this nice its a lot of gold jewelry  that im going to have to look into if its really coming back with her that she took out as she says or is it really purchased from outside the us and shes trying to smuggle it in so im going to ask you mhm why do you have this receipt for one emerald ring yeah so what happened is i wanted to clean it so my jeweler does cleaning over there yeah in india you have a family jeweler i cannot to have it cleaned here i took them to wash it and clean it and make sure if i find receipts were going to have a problem  here right yeah no please goe its good your check i just have to verify okay have nothing to hide you can open up my wallet [music] too so you did buy some gold i i bought it for my niece her wedding anniversary is but you still bought it i bought it how come you didnt declare this sorry i forgot what other gold did you buy thats that this is the only thing i bought you sure yeah you can take a look at it dont dont touch that hold on i wont touch only i can at this point yeah what is this uh i dont know jewelry  receipts so you purchase this just on this page we have a lot you see this 6,000 right its a lot of money we have to add this up this team right here will come out check the the container this see if the commodity in the container matches what was manifested and then we will physically do the inspection to make sure that they [music] match the manifest for this container its showing a styrofoam packaging i see like some brown boxes that looks like a different commodity so lets just go ahead and send it back to the shed so  we can take a better look at it all right all right we have an anomaly so its probably good that we run the dog all right its aoc good boy good boy theres something in there all right lets take lets get this whole front side yeah lets take the whole front side off six brown boxes that do not belong theyre not showing up on the man at all all right you bring us in thats good bring us in lets bring this one down yeah i see not stoam yeah go and take it off oh yeah we got something all right see what we got im going to prob  a couple of these oh yeah yeah we got white powder yeah we have white powder just by looking from a specific cartel probably coming out of dominican republic may have originated from somewhere else also we have six boxes so were going to take it back and test it to see exactly what type of substance that it is and then well take it from that point going forward ready 1 three this box is heavy get this one out yeah take this theyre all taped together here were going to use some knife can get some  more all right so going go ahead put some of this on there [music] positive cocaine senstive test positive what were going to do is weigh it and then well also contact hsi to see what steps they want to take next [music] you purchase this we have to add this up all right so how much is this adding up to do you understand this is adding up to $5,000 well thats one side we got to go on the other side theres exact prices of how much you paid she has1 $15,000 worth of gold are you aware you have to pay duty on gold i already paid  the taxes no you pay tax uh duty here i mean i already paid for the taxes and i have to the d so when when you come into the us yeah right all purchases you have to pay duty on these items right yeah already paid taxes but thats irrelevant to us you have to pay duty to the us government when you purchase anything you know what tell me what i i have receipts from all over the place yep some american receipts are also so make sure you dont take those maam i do this every day i know exactly what im looking for but i want to make  sure well make sure before you leave at i want it to be fair its always going to be fair maam okay all right were going to move on to the bags so you did declare 6,000 in clothes and the new clothes that you are declaring are in there right y can i put back pleas yeah you take anything out no i want to make sure i have all my jewelry otherwise i have to complain well everythings recorded so you can file a complaint if if you think something is missing i have to check it out yeah because how do i know i got all  my so youre declaring $6,000 right $6,000 because i bought sores for my daughter and my me because of the wedding yeah and then we have more here 6,000 im roughly sa okay but you have to declare things yes the right way if there is a failure to declare the government can seize these items i know i know that so i am very familiar with i been im a us citizen okay but you didnt declare everything because i go back at 4 six months but did you ever pay duty supposed to pay here like this i declare it i pay taxes on this okay  where here and i pay my overall taxes okay no thats irrelevant this is us customs and you have to pay duty here okay okay thats fine so im going to make the calculation so the cloes you did declare you were doing good but then we have a lot of items missing so on those items youre going to have to pay penalty items you did cler is going to be $56 the penalty on the other items is $5,600 so i have to ask are you going to pay it or yes i am but this is ridiculous i go there every year youre telling us not to go to our own her  penalty was pretty hefty but people who want to bring in1 $15,000 worth of gold are going to get penalized and she decided to pay and she walked out of here with her stuff tough cookie hey brother mexicos insisting on her bring it back to w is okay all right sounds good all back the cartel keeps asking her questions keeps telling her to take the vehicle back to mexico weve gone with the r that the vehicle wont start so what well do is have two undercover agents posing a shopper stop to make it  look like were trying to fix the vehicle with the anticipation of any counter surveillance seeing that and they will relay that information back to the cartel to give legitimacy to the the claim we had her make approaching the driver side now [music] friendly making contact with her our agents are going through the motions of inspecting the vehicle to see whats wrong with it and then shell make contact with the cartel and watas and tell them hey we just had someone look at it its not working what do you want  me to do in hopes that they send someone to come pick up the vehicle has been closed and friendlies and subject are not walking when it comes into these types of operations patience is the key a control delivery it could take 20 minutes could take hours the longest ive ever been on one is 7 days not ready to to give up on it yet be cognizant of a mercedes stationed right now with a male subject inside not exiting the vehicle looks like they have a view of the target vehicle right he had a gray looks like a  nissan suv pull up right next to the mercedes new mexico tags both subjects exited and are have any discussion outside they are walking towards the target vehicle both occupants left the vehicle theyre headed towards the target vehicle actually theyre going to a gmc pickup truck to talk to the occupants there and this looks like its uh legitimate business discussion theyre having theyre not paying attention to our target vehicle so it doesnt look like theyre associated with this smuggling attempt at all you just got to  be cognizant of everything going on around you you know to determine whether its part of the smuggling operation or if its just like i said actual legitimate work hey brother whats the status okay we gave it the shot to see if the counter would change their mind but apparently that didnt happen the cartel is still communicating with the driver however theyre being insistent on the vehicle and the driver going back to mexico subject walking towards the target vehicle get ready to follow out  so this point we are going to throw in another roose that we got the vehicle running and shes going to take the vehicle back to mexico however she will be stopped and inspected at an outbound inspection theyll magically find the narcotics in the vehicle vehicle going be on the move the target vehicle is going back to the port of entry at that point we will start processing the evidence the narcotics and see what kind of intelligence we can obtain i think there was a spawner once we got there and she made counts and they said  no return to what is i think we were burned from here right now theyre doing an inspection of the vehicle here we go packages to make sure that we dont miss any bundles that might be hidden with inside the car we have found a total of eight black tape bundles and were going to go ahead and test it to confirm that is cocaine they had a lot of wrappings have plastic foil and another plastic positive for cocaine 8.97 kilos of cocaine we attempted to conduct this control delivery however sometimes these  operations as well planned as they are they just dont work out but its not a failure in any way cuz we were able to collect a lot of intelligence a lot of information which led us to be able to target other individuals other co-conspirators the case was presented to the united states attorneys office who did accept federal prosecution of the driver so at this point the driver will be booked into the el paso county jail to await her initial appearance her arraignment the following day and were  still communicating with her and doing everything we can to uh ensure safety as much as [music] possible what you got its covered in some type of oil what kind of oil right now we dont know it looks like its got a copy paper and layers and layers of saran wrap and uh vacuum seal packages all to throw off the dog see how many pounds we [music] have 215 kg of cocaine feel pretty good its a good day at miami seport this is not completely uncommon we do see seizures of this size and this amount several times a year but the  officers out here do a great job of inspecting cargo thats coming in and these types of seizures really create havoc for the organizations we are going to attempt to identify the folks who introduced this contraband into the shipment hopefully we can take action to get them into custody

received a report from miami international airport about a crazy customer who had assaulted an airline  employee the young lady and a friend had missed their flight and for some reason decided to blame the airline employee for it when the officers arrived at the scene to understand the situation they had to interrogate an eyewitness it was at that moment that they began to realize the level of

two females i did take a picture picture  just or video just i didnt get this which i wish i would have but i was more worried about watching it making sure everything was black and reason why because

the hook uh the one with the colored hair in the see so i can reference the girls and youll know whos he had one in pink yeah shes a second  girl so this is the second girl this is the first girl that

my friend get off my friend you know what i mean going off dropping f bombs thats cu two officers approached her cuz shes out of control then she got out of control and he tried to approached her and then caught her down and then she was like dont touch  me i aint done nothing wrong so he was kind of like a little passive which is fine okay then they smartly moved her out of here shes going crazy and spazzing out and they had to put her down to the ground at some point you got to i was like they need to put her down like they were like two nights thats when the other girl got loose and the two officers were down i had gotten off my bike now and i saw her coming and i was ready to jump on her at any moment because he had to weasel he had to catch  up and she had full access to a gun gun one of the officers thats what i was worried about so thats why i stayed ryan after discussing with the witness the officers proceeded to approach the witness who was already struggling with airport
