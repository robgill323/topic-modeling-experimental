here it's Quinton [Music] rwer since the dawn of human civilization human culture has always been at least a little bit stuck on the past and that's something that has  always reflected in the media of every generation in the 1950s people were obsessed with the mob culture of the 1920s fast forward to the80s and Cinema was suddenly all about capturing the diners cars and culture of the ' 50s and of course Hollywood's most recent calling card has become obsessively recapping 80s Nostalgia and franchises Ghostbusters Voltron Gremlins before we're gone everything from the 8S will be back in one form or another but now that we've entered current year 2016 it feels as if that Nostalgia wave  is finally catching up to the late 1990s and early 2000s the very time where I was born and raised and the biggest evidence to this is how various companies and studios are are now promising or perhaps threatening to bring back those era defining properties this includes Nickelodeon who are currently planning revivals of such Classics as Hey Arnold Rocco's Modern Life and Rugrats just to name a few and one show that I really think deserves to be brought back more than any other is the Fairly Odd Parents a classic Nick  tune about a boy and his magical god parents which was cancelled in 2006 just as it felt like it was reaching its peak I'm being factious of course because the Fairly Odd Parents is somehow still on the air in current year 206 and it's terrible seeing a show you love go off the air just when it's getting good can be painful but what's nearly as bad is watching that for consistency what's next a talking dog with radical attitude no seriously that's what they did next i bark [Applause] budny he's totally in my face and now  these genius writers have decided to introduce another brand new character to the cont um Chloe carmichel a sassy new Teen who shares Timmy's godparents and definitely isn't going to get the show cancelled but through all these controversies and mistakes none of these are the worst when it comes to the many fairly odd blunders glorious viewers of current year 2016 I present grow up Timmy Turner a 2011 movie set 10 years after the original series with which is intended to be a finale of sorts does it live up  to the original show let's find out he's so cute when he sleeps I'm little angel shh don't wake him up happy birthday Wanda Cosmo what are you guys crazy you're a grown man still wearing horsey pajamas and you're asking if we're crazy crazy with excitement happy 23rd birthday wao thanks guys go ahead poof give it to him thanks poof so we open the film on the birthday party of our protagonist Timmy Turner km and wander revealed that a massive surprise is in store to celebrate 23 years of Tim Tim as they  have magicked up a ship of pirates that crashes into Timmy's bedroom so he can practice stabbing people in the ass to the right to the left everything you own in a box to the left not even 5 minutes in and already this film is so outrageous that it hardly feels real and perhaps the biggest issue is the elephant in the room Drake Bell seen here playing an aged up Timmy Turner but perhaps aged up is a bit of a misnomer because as the Pirates are defeated and liveaction jorgan appears we learn what's going on in the original series  it was often stated that fairy god parents are meant to be gifted to children who have bitter lives and need that extra support but when children grow too old break the rules or obtain happy lives the fairies get taken away and the child's memories are wiped of their God Parents in fact Siri antagonist Crocker was eventually given the tragic backstory that Cosmo and Wanda were once his fairy god parents until his memories being wiped drove him insane anywh who in this film we learn that Timmy Cosmo and Wanda eventually  figured out a loophole of sorts Dar rules apparently defines growing up in very specific terms to meet these standards a child must either grow up move out of his family home or fall in love the only girl I've ever kissed was T it was 13 years ago it was forced upon me and I did not enjoy it look out anyway she moved away and no one ever saw her again so to recap while in his 20s Timmy still lives with his parents maintains an emotional attachment to his childhood possessions and doesn't have a  love life but that's all pretty standard he is a millennial after all the really weird thing that Timmy does to maintain his fairies is he has remained in elementary school yes Timmy Turner is a 23-year-old in the fifth grade who hangs out with 10-year-olds all day and the literal only person who thinks this is weird is Crocker rle me this class how does a 23-year-old man still managed to stay in the fifth grade all these years how does he do it how is it even possible hm now briefly ignoring that by  these standards there were numerous points in the original series where Timmy would have have become an adult by these qualifications is this really the natural progression of these characters the idea of Timmy losing his fairies always came across like one of the most adult parts of the original series because in many ways that is what it feels like to grow up there are people in your life and experiences you'll have that one day you have to let go of and there is some part of the childhood experience that will always be hard to  understand once you're an adult and I guess you could argue that this would be the future that Tera strong strong Timmy would imagine himself going on to have and it's certainly in character with late stage episodes like Timmy secret wish but the really weird part to me is how Cosmo and Wanda just go along with it in fact they almost act like it was their idea in the first place that feels totally detached from their characterization in the original show or at least their characterization when the  show was good also the fairies in this interpretation are generally just weird in writing yes but more importantly in execution in the original show the characters had balance the fairies were present in every moment and felt like an extension of that world Cosmo and Wanda we as much people as everyone else in the show but in this film it's like the fairies were a last minute Edition they're not given a lot of dialogue usually so they mostly just fly around the screen stemming whenever no one is  directly paying attention to them a God child loses his fairies when he grows up not me he leaves home not me love well again it gets really annoying really quickly and never feels connected to whatever else is going on and if you take a drink every time Drake Bell is staring blankly into space at nothing in particular you'll find yourself at an AA meeting by the first commercial break when you do movies like this you're supposed to supply Aid to the actors to give them hints about the final production you know markers and balloons  and that kind of thing and if something goes wrong you have the animation match the choices of the actors and even if the implementation of these effects had been seamless it wouldn't erase the fact that they're all just ghastly creatures there's something to be said about the common yet delicate process of turning 2D characters into 3D models now for many eras of Animation this can be pretty much seamless as many art styles are designed to have that realistic feel if you look at any Disney princess it's  pretty easy to imagine them spinning around in 360 but other animated stories have a very stylized look meant only to be seen on a flat plane so when you try to bring them into the 3D space they just look creepy this has been a major problem since day one with this franchise look at any typical example of attempts to represent these characters in in merchandise or Hell take a glance at the Jimmy Timmy Power Hour that series of specials featured the Fairly Odd Parents and Jimmy Neutron cast swapping art styles while very few  characters transitioned well the worst affected were Cosmo and Wanda the biggest issue is that the Fairly Odd Parents is drawn in an isometric three quarters perspective this means that the characters are are kind of looking forward and kind of looking to the side which explains a lot of the character design quirks which are present it looks good in 2D but when you take those same details and turn them into a plush or a toy or a 3D animation it doesn't look right faults like these you can accept  in the Jimmy Timmy films because the entire charm was seeing these characters outside of their usual arena in this film film that excuse doesn't work and it's made worse by how disturbingly realistic everyone's skin is something about the texture just throws me off it reminds me of those weird postpartum depression dolls you see on Etsy not to mention all the weird details like how Cosmo has this thin red outline around his mouth that makes him look like he has chapped lips or that he's wearing  Joker makeup or something obviously there is a way to depict 2D character in the 3D plane without it feeling totally uncanny look at the Peanuts movie that came out last year made by Blue Sky Studios characters here are animated with a nonliteral sculpt meant only to be seen from one angle of course the Peanuts movie essentially invented entirely new technology to achieve this but you can find a similar mentality to how the characters were depicted in the earliest Fairly Odd Parents video games  which do a much better job of simulating these isometric designs in 3D but on that note if the liveaction and animated material are ultimately never going to be cohesive why not just do what Ned's Declassified did and make Cosmo and Wanda 2D animated surely that would look much better than whatever the hell is going on here moving on to other subjects if there's any silver lining to this film it's the guy playing Crocker the first time I watched this I was seriously convinced that he was dubbed  over by the original actor but no he's just doing that solid of an impersonation although I do have to take some criticism at the film's failure to capture even the most basic elements of his character design his ears go on his neck come on people it's basic anatomy jorgan and Timmy's dad are also perfectly achieved in fact Timmy's dad really is played by Darren Norris who also voices the character also weird aside did you know that from the beginning of the oak cartoons and to this very day Cosmo and Wanda have  always had the same voice actors as Tim's parents that's the kind of fun fact that makes your head explode spontaneously [Music] ow incidentally Mom and Dad's whole bit in this film is that they've spent the last few years desperately trying to get Timmy to off here as a 23rd birthday gift they reveal that they've sold the house and he's going to be out on his own but Timmy casually wishes that they hadn't sold the house and his parents run outside in a frenzy instantly knowing that everything has  been undone you know that one episode of The Twilight Zone where that that six-year-old is like God and his entire Community is terrified of him and his unexplained omnipotence grow up Timmy Turner has that kind of energy I don't know if it's intentional but honestly sometimes it's actually pretty funny but these few positives are absolutely not the standard as the attempt to make the liveaction material seem cartoony usually ends up coming across rather Vicky with cone tits the biggest tor diale Timmy Turner Icky Vicky someone  had to plan this someone had to take out a piece of paper and write down Vicky pointy boobs and that piece of paper had to go up through the chain of command it had to go through an entire process of approval and no one shot this one down it's also worth talking about how creepy it feels whenever you actually see Drake Bell fraternizing with children crazy if getting out of school early on my birthday and having more time to be a kid is crazy well then people strap me in a straight jacket so joran is trying  to trick Timmy into becoming an adult through various means and his first plan involves sneaking into the school with Cupid's arrow and shooting Timmy with it however he accidentally shoots another kid by mistake Who falls in love with the school mascot but can we just stop here for a moment and question like what jorg's plan actually was jorgan was going to shoot a grown man with Cupid's arrow while he was surrounded exclusively by children this could have ended very badly but apparently Tommy doesn't need  to be coerced with Cupid's arrows because he sees one woman in town doing that slow motion my pants are about to fall down and I don't have a belt walk and he decides to stalk her through town to get her attention this this leads him to the town park where we witness a press conference being hosted by a business Mogul named Hugh J magnate who has just bought the park so it can be converted into what I gather to be an oil Hotel ladies and gentlemen ever since Daddy slapped a shovel in my little hand I have been looking for fuel  to run our everyday lives and so when my Hightech thermal satell lights detected a massive untapped combustible resource field under the city I decided to come here to dumale and see for myself now I don't know if it's obvious but this character the main bad guy of the movie is actually inspired by Biff Tannon from Back to the Future Part Two who was in turn inspired by Donald Trump let's say China the magnet power oil well hotel to be built on the site of this gry stinky yucky pokey little park it will produce a  th000 gigabots of filthy yet reasonably affordable energy and provide decent room service yeah that's that's Trump that's Trump right there I I that's our man you know it is so frustrating how many bad guys in movies end up being weirdly veiled parodies of Donald Trump but maybe it only bothers me because I am so exhausted from his campaign Trail I tell you after Hillary wins in November I hope we never hear from this guy again also at the unite the right rally are Chester and AJ who just watch look who it is Mr never  grew up Timmy Turner he's checking us out just like the lady yeah that's right Timmy T looks like AJ is all grown up and styling in a brand new Argy sweat and me Professional Security expert fighting crime with my smarty melon and multiple keys on attractable wire so the implication of this scene if you'll excuse the pun is that Chester and AJ are secretly super jelly of Tommy and that they're upset that he got to stay in the fifth grade for over a decade while they became boring adults but in reality I tend to  feel bad for people I know who got held back one time so a situation like this would play out a little bit less like that and more like Tommy it's Chester remember me the fifth grade Chester and a Chester oh man Tommy I haven't seen you since you got held back in the fifth grade how you been doing no dude I'm doing great it's the highlight of Our Lives you know yeah man I get that so so what you in like college or something a yeah dude um still in the fifth grade actually are you serious my days are great they're so  easy I just get to prank Cocker all day hang out with 10-year-old girls we play dodgeball I buy them ice cream it is so cool yeah man that's uh that's great look I got to like run some uh errands you know but I'll definitely talk to you later all right dude uh don't go to the park tomorrow so Trump more like drump am I right tries to start construction of his hotel but the young woman that Tommy followed into the park reveals that she is stay ing a protest as she chains herself very Loosely to a tree drump  however says he doesn't care and orders the bulldozer to run over her and the tree which sounds pretty ridiculous but let's be honest with ourselves if you heard that a protester had been killed by a bulldozer at a trump rally would you really doubt it Tommy Wishes the bulldozer would stop working and it does but drumph is not deterred and orders his men to murder her with chainsaws to the celebration of everyone Tommy Wishes the chainsaws would become balloons and I guess that scene is some kind of Union  difficulty and they all leave it's around this point that we find out that this character is actually Tutti that must be my mistake I keep getting these names wrong okay so who is this character for real cuti wow I got to tell you that was incredible are you serious are you not joking that's that's toy this is fine Tommy and Tootsie speak again in person and really hit it off but Tommy runs away when he remembers he can't fall in love meanwhile Trump and ianka are mulling over how their press conference didn't  go to plan like how their bulldozer broke down and some chainsaws turned into balloons typical acts of God always mysteriously disrupting the lives of billionaires soon Trump is contacted by a mysterious Ally with a distorted Voice who soon reveals himself to be Crocker indeed I am isn't technology great now I kind of get what they were going for here when you have a simple show that mostly revolves around the dull status quo of a select set of characters one of the easiest ways to do an event episode is simply to dash in a  new sense of stakes when I was a kid the SpongeBob movie really hooked me in this way you see Plankton started off as this gag villain trying to steal a veggie burger recipe to no avail only for him to then become a serious threat when he took over bikini bottom in the film my years of investment felt paid off and it also seemed like the stakes had never been so high but if you're going to go for this it's best to use the pre-existing mechanics of the world we already know it works a whole lot less for instance when you  introduce an entirely new bad guy with less clearly defined motivations and then treat him as the big thread of the special while still presenting him as an absolute buffoon hell if you still want to do the basic plot of this special why not switch out this loser with Doug Dimmadome come on think about it this is a character all the fans know he's outright woried online and if you want to have a bad guy who is a billionaire Mogul trying to gentrify every remaining quaint part of dimsdale why not use the  character who already has that defined as his stick now that I think about it the issue with this project is that most of the gags in The Fairly Odd Parents only work in animation if you try to pull over the source material directly it just feels forced but that one visual gag where Doug dimmadome's hat keeps going past the end of the screen that would kill in liveaction and just doing that one trick would almost justify this entire mess but instead of two Legacy bad guys teaming up to become a  threatening yet entertaining duo we have this Crocker X some guy I don't know so back of the Turner residence the Fairley try to coach Tommy on why he's been acting so strange you've been acting sick since you saw toy in the Park yesterday sick no I I just have a cold or something yeah that's uh that's what being sick means Tommy Oh no you're falling in love with toy that means you're growing up and you'll lose us forever uh-oh that wasn't in the script Drake Bell himself on set and and that was his organic  reaction the fairly's deduced that Tommy's love meter has grown meaning he's one step closer to falling in love and moving out of his parents house which means that he would have to give up Reddit or something I don't know I haven't really been uh paying a lot of attention Tootsie soon arrives to see Tommy causing his parents to shower her with praise and rice hoping to exercise him from their house we give you money livestock raisins through the power of hormones two convinces Tommy to go on a  date with her and as they Ride On a Bicycle Built for Two Chester and AJ mock them from a distance this is definitely one of the details in this film that I like the least when I was a kid my all-time favorite detail of the Fairly Odd Parents was how these three guys would stick together there were so many episodes that were all about friendship and how important these guys were to Tommy and it just feels Hollow to throw all that away for the sake of some jokes about how Chester and AJ wish that they were in the fifth grade at age  23 it's just strange to me that by trying to make these characters more Goofy and generic for this format they've made the animated stories with these same characters feel much more grounded and fully realized meanwhile at drump Tower Cocker and Trump are planning a device that will allow to capture the Fairley with Cocker already having explained their existence and magical powers they also made out for a bit as well so I think they've definitely bonded by this point in the movie stake University deduces that once  they steal the Fairley the only way to bring Tommy to them is to capture Tootsie as well now that I think about it I don't actually know why they need Tommy but uh they've decided they do so Tootsie and Tommy end up going on a fancy date at a restaurant and so Cosmo and Wanda decide they have to intervene as they transform into humans and are special celebrity guest stars Cheryl Hines of Curb Your Enthusiasm plays liveaction Wanda while Jason Alexander of Seinfeld Glory plays Cosmo hey fun fact did you know that  Cheryl Hines is married to Robert F Kennedy Jr yeah I didn't know RFK had a either it says here on his Wikipedia page that he is the president of the Board of Water keeper Alliance which is a nonprofit focused on preserving Water Resources around the planet he's got a radio show he wrote some kids books it says here he is quote an avid Whitewater rafter and yeah that all seems pretty cool I'll have to keep an eye on what he gets up to in the next few years what are you guys doing and what have you  done to yourselves we're Waiters surrogate parents to some extent I mean they are literally his god parents they're the parents Timmy has when his biological parents are away and while Timmy's actual mom and dad were dysfunctional erratic and distant Cosmo and Wanda were intended to be somewhat more idic to be compassionate and thoughtful to both Timmy and each other but the problem with this pitch is that while it is wholesome it isn't very funny So eventually the show changed two important things over time number one  Cosmo is stupid now number two Cosmo and Wanda hate each other and eventually after half a dozen Universe shattering movie events the world of the Fairly Odd Parents starts to feel a lot more lore motivated and a lot less character motivated and the way that Cosmo Wanda act in this film is so out of left field that it's out right abusive they hate each other they fight constantly throughout the film and their entire motivation is that they want to keep their surrogate godchild emotionally 10 years old forever and it doesn't help  that I constantly feel like liveaction Wanda is about to try and sell me into a pyramid scheme about scented pine cones or something stop toti from what from taking you away from us you're falling in love Timmy and if that happens the three of us won't be together oh I've got an idea why don't you wish that tuty was in Alaska right now no also you want to know a funny story well I'll tell you anyways while making this video I made a list of original series characters who appear in this movie I forgot to put  Timmy and toy on that list and the reason is that these two have absolutely nothing to do with their original characters Timmy is supposed to be a lot of things neurotic controlling sentimental dead pan a conster a slacker a little Gremlin with buck teeth and the filmmakers went pink got it toty I think you can defend a little bit in the original series she's the young child of the family always running to avoid the abuse of her sister and of course she has her long-standing crush on Timmy in this film she's been away for a decade  she's an environmentalist she's acrobatic she loves animals I guess guess but at the very least it seems very true to her character that after becoming a successful and beautiful woman the first thing she wants to do in her hometown is impress Timmy despite him being a literal Manchild whose closest friends haven't learned about negative numbers yet and sure you can argue that there are scenes where 2D seems misdirected or ere expressive but you have to keep in mind it is not easy to apply a shake Experian performance to  a character named after the act of Breaking Wind oh I almost forgot about the most important part of this scene Tootsie has bought Tommy a new hat and it's like a pink Fedora and this is a visual representation of his emancipation from childhood to adulthood he's an adult now because he wears a fedora Tommy is so grateful that he decides to have Cosmo and Wanda Grant one Last Wish which causes Cosmo to vibrate like a phone His Wish is for the town park to be restored to how it was during their childhoods which has been what Tootsie  has wanted the entire film the two sit together in the tree and reminisce about the past but when Tootsie tries to kiss him Tommy Falls backwards and slams to the ground what happened Timmy um I fell out of a tree it looked like you fell out of the tree so you wouldn't have to kiss me it's just really complicated right now are you seeing someone else no did you just get out of a bad relationship no uh well uh maybe he just doesn't feel comfortable with the situation he's been put in uh maybe he's  not used to this sort of thing and he just needs time to be able to do something like that I I don't understand how I could love someone since third grade someone who rebuilds a park for me saves my tree and then creates it's the most romantic day ever and then tells me he can't kiss me okay look he does not owe you anything okay you can't just try and guilt people into these things because you spent the day with them that that that's a very harsh and and not a nice thing thing to do okay okay okay I  think you need to to take a take a step back just check your privilege grow up Timmy Turner do you believe so Tootsie is enraged and storms off when she suddenly sees a bunny minding its own business and totally not needing saved so she goes to save it of course a big net raises up and Tooty has been kidnapped you H ironic isn't it someone who cares so much for helpless little creatures was betrayed by a helpless little creature okay look dude we get it you're Donald Trump it stopped being menacing a  super long time ago magnate got characterization aside it's objectively funny that as far as they could possibly know Cosmo and Wanda just witnessed literal human TR trafficking and they couldn't be more excited about it but Poof's judgmental stare convinces them that what they're doing is wrong and they have to help save toot SE by the way have you noticed that this is the first time in the plot description that I've Nam dropped poof that's because he's a pointless character who neither adds nor subtracts from any  particular scene that he's in if the plot isn't directly about him he has nothing to do he can't provide commentary he can't help out cuz he baby so instead he just floats in the corner of the screen he's kind of like Scrappy do he saved the franchise from certain death he was really in your face for the first like season he was there and now he just stands around and smiles let's tell Timmy and save Dy don't worry little F you know what I take it back this new Ghostbusters reboot doesn't look half  bad so Tommy's friends from school run to tell him that Tootsie has been human trafficked and he soon also learns that his fairlies are in distress thus he has to find a way to save everybody and the only logical option is is for him to steal a motorcycle and then wreck it for absolutely no reason also along the way he knocks a pets into Vicki causing her to run after him and then jorgan shoots a love arrow and it misses Tommy and shoots Vicki so now Vicki is in love with jorgan and scene so Trump and  Cocker take tootsie pop into the secret underground lair which is like if Marilyn Manson designed a McDonald's play place Trump wishes for a ball pit and I figure you have to have magic powers to get one of those cuz I haven't seen one since I was like four and there was that big pink ey scare I've seen a lot of empty ball pits but why would you go in an empty ball pit it's just a hole with a tarp over it anyways Trump Wishes the ball pit was never ending and that Cocker would fall in and we see him whst  away into the balls Vortex and there goes the best part of the film so Tommy knows that there are only two people in dimsdale who can possibly help rescue Tootsie and his fair Le Chester and AJ Chester oh God take my wallet take it just take it leave me alone dude you got to help me man you got to help me oh God what do you want dude listen listen man are you wearing a fedora dude listen to me okay they took him dude they take they took him who was it who this Donald Trump took my faires man what I need my  fair we got to break into the Trum towers and steal them back I don't want anything I don't want to be a part of this you got to I swear to God if you don't help me I'll kill your family okay Cher so Trump continues to act out and use the faires for childish gains he brings a 3-in toy to life grows gigantic muscles and embarrasses his only secret service agent so he is left alone without security also it seems to me that the 3-in [Music] do this this is going to be epic I just want you guys to know I really  appreciate how much you guys good luck timy you still owe us girlfriends no no that's my fault I that's my fault for expecting this movie to do something right Tommy finds Neverland Ranch and discovers that Trump has been using the Fairly so much that their energies are depleted and they're going to die and like I I don't know why Trump would uh do that like I don't know why he would kill his faires because like you figure those are his only pair you'd think he'd let him like charge back up or like not immediately drain  them to the point of death cuz apparently if they die all this is undone so what's even what's even the point if you're just if you're just going to kill him but Tommy can't save Tootsie or the fair Lees because he's suddenly attacked by Ultra Magnus over here but he does some quick thinking there's nothing sadder than opening up a new boy it comes without batteries 3-in figures do not take batteries I feel like you should know this it's then that Tommy and Tootsie are confronted by Trump who prepares to  use the last of the Fairley power to blow them both away but Tommy professes that he has fallen in love with Tootsie and he kisses her and now that he's kissed a girl that means he's become an adult except no no it does not the standards this movie uses to judge when you start being an adult is just Bonkers realistically Tommy isn't actually in love with this girl he's enamored with the superficial aspects he's gleamed about her over the last few days it is at best infatuation and that is not something that only adults do  hell it's one of Timmy's most consistent running characteristics in the original show oh so having a crush makes you grownup having a job makes you grown up hell the only one of these three things that Tommy hadn't done in the original cartoon is move out of his parents' house what so living with your parents makes you a kid hey you the economy's hard Okay so so the fairies disappear now that Tommy has become an adult Trump goes crazy and is put away which is the least believable part of the movie and ianka takes over  the company but as jorgan passes by still being chased by Vicki he reveals that he has a big announcement so it turns out the Fairley are like Santa Claus in that they're always watching you and the Fairley Council was so impressed by Tommy saving their worlds once again that they have enacted a special resolution allowing him and only him to keep his memories and Cosmo and Wanda but only as long as he uses their powers exclusively for charitable goals and thus Timmy learns the true lesson of the film to Never Grow Up and to always  live with your parental figures I'm sure after this he also begins to consider how he's going to support himself when he's got a fourth trate education no discernable talents and he can only use his fairies for charitable goals is there some sort of political hack in there where you can still make a profet while doing charitable things who knows I'm sure there is I'm sure this will do with the rest of his life I also want to point out that this film essentially makes it that one of the greatest  episodes in the show's history is now certainly not canon just want to point out that we traded in Alec Baldwin for Drake Bell uh an interesting choice but I feel like it might work out in the long term so with the rest of their lives set out before them poof suddenly prepared to deliver his first words finally his first words yo man it's going to be so cool man we going to be bumping man trying to help the boys out you know how we do it you feel me dog I don't know man is This Racist is this woke is it funny is it stupid is it  Shakespeare is it Mel Brooks I have no idea please free me from this hell of my own design so Tommy begins his new life as a proud fourth grade graduate at 23 years old living in a van with his girlfriend and his godparents but hey like I said economy is rough the group fly off towards the camera like the end of Back to the Future and we learn that Chester and AJ got laid after all after that in a brief Stinger we see that Cocker has also survived setting up a potential sequel so that was grow up Timmy Turner  and I can see what they're going for they wanted to recreate the original product while continuing it with a new twist and in some ways I can really respect that idea but let's be fair let's be 100% truthful here there are Fairly Odd Parents porn parodies that capture the spirit of the original show more accurately the weirdest thing about this film to me is that most of the main credited contributors have some history with the show Butch Hartman co-wrote the script alongside Scott fellows who wrote  a significant amount of the show's Golden Era and is the creator of Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide one of my all-time favorite shows from when I was a kid there is no Boogeyman to blame the depiction of the franchise on with this movie but I'm going to blame Drake Bell and anyways because I feel like you can never go wrong blaming Drake Bell Jokes Aside grow up to be Turner is such a weird film because the concept itself just doesn't hold together as a premise if you had to write and direct A liveaction Fairly Odd  Parents movie Set 13 years later starring Drake Bal as a Billy Madison style 23-year-old in the fifth grade could you make a great film well sure you could but not while keeping it PG-13 you only get one F bomb people I'm putting it when when he falls out of the tree and sure maybe if it had been different if you changeed some things if you had all the characters be in high school or if you put more emphasis on the coming of age themes maybe it would have worked a little bit but personally I like to take the Zack baggin approach  sometimes when something is truly cursed it doesn't need diagnosed it needs to you can tell that a lot of effort went into this movie and I respect that but it steers so off course that it is an insult to the medium of Storytelling hell it is insulting to humanity I personally want a ridden apology etched upon Stone and put in the town square of every town in America and this is ultimately just a sad situation where without a better script more clear Direction a different cast and an entirely different concept for a film  what you have here is a bad movie movie Bad movie not good well there's one good thing to take out of this film and that is that honestly it's it's the lowest point we can go to I mean by comparison everything that's made after this has to be the greatest thing ever right yeah I'm sure I'll never regret saying that [Music] sentence I wish that Donald Trump was President no [Music] diabetes Life's A Piece of Cake reusing this intro cuz it took some time to make down the hall until his room he starts  renting instantly c s make him just temp for in reality he is a beards and fled [Music] com vi vi white people alien Quint you'll wait Le 2 hours here it's [Music] Quint there are too many traditions in the review household even count when it comes to the holidays every year we put up a billion decorations we get all excited we sit around the bonfire and then we wait until mid January to finally let the celebrations begin but my favorite thing of all to do is to look back into my own past and to  find something that I feel like really represents the core of the holiday not just of Christmas itself but of what I love about the world and Humanity so I figured a good starting place was Drake Bell about 7 months ago I reviewed grow up Timmy Turner a 2011 Direct Television film based on the early 2000s hit program The Fairly Odd Parents it's become one of my all-time favorite videos and more importantly it's one of my most popular with over 4,000 views and so it's no surprise that the sequel film a fairly on Christmas is  one of my most requested video topics in current year 2017 with some even going as far as to promise me a viewing experience much worse than the original film and for me that's always been a little hard to imagine whenever I review something no matter how how much I hate watching it or how many bitter words I spew out during the review by the time I'm done editing the video I've usually gained some kind of respect for it as if I formed a personal relationship with this piece of media and I get kind of  defensive about it grow up Timmy Turner is an exception to this I dislike it to the point that I pull extreme personal satisfaction from knowing that I will never have to watch it ever again and the sequel it's worse how could it possibly be worse spoilers it's

A8	https://youtu.be/5SZfYzavu8E?si=CO9ILFMExGXSMIal	what's going on guys it's Greg here AKA NY prepper it is Thursday April 4th 2024 and I have an emergency alert to share with you guys right now it is 21:51 Eastern time here in the United States and I wanted to update you on the situation in Israel the whole world is watching and waiting to see what Iran is going to do to Israel in the coming hours Iran has vowed a harsh response to the Israeli air strike on their Consulate in Damascus Syria which is basically the equivalent of striking Iranian territory because a country's  consulate or Embassy is the equivalent of that country's territory and we have senior Israeli officials saying that the Iranian response could occur tomorrow and I want to remind you guys that there's a 7h hour time difference from Israel so it's actually morning time already in Israel right now so this could all pop off any hour any minute and if something does happen I will go live as long as necessary to cover the situation but we know that Israel is on high alert earlier today we heard that the Israeli  government told all Hospital managers in Israel to make sure that they maximize their staff this coming weekend obviously to deal with casualties from any air strikes by Iran and Senior Israeli officials say that Israel has indications that Iran May attack Israel from its territory using long range ballistic missiles drones or cruise missile this was reported by Walla news and Senior Israeli officials say they made it clear to the us that they will have to respond if they get attacked by Iran so we're on  the verge of a war with Iran because what's going to happen is Iran is going to strike Israel in the coming hours and then Israel is going to respond and then Iran is going to respond back and it's just going to escalate until the US has to get involved and then we could be looking at a fullscale decapitation strike on the Iranian military and on their nuclear program and Iran signed a defense agreement with Russia so then Russia could potentially get involved and defend Iran and that could kick off  World War III okay so this is a very very serious situation and I'm going to be monitoring it for you and like I said when this all happens I will go live so make sure you're subscribed hit the notification Bell down below so you get notified when I do go live we also have some breaking news coming from Europe apparently Britain France and northern European countries are preparing to send troops to Ukraine and this was stated by the US state department consultant Edward lotw walk in a column for  unheard portal in his opinion NATO countries will soon have to send troops to Ukraine anyway otherwise the alliance will be forced to accept a catastrophic defeat and I've been saying for weeks now that the Ukrainian front lines are on the verge of collapsing okay Russia has been spending the last year mobilizing and preparing for this new offensive while the West has been Dilly dallying and they haven't been giving Ukraine what they need to win at the appropriate times they haven't gotten what they need that's why the counter  offensive has failed Russia is in a wartime mode they're devoting 30% of their budget to their military this is serious guys okay so very serious looks like NATO countries Britain France and northern European countries are preparing to send troops into Ukraine okay because because Russia is about to break through the lines and they could push all the way to the Deno River and basically take the entire eastern half of Ukraine and apparently the strike by Israel on the Iranian Consulate in Damascus was viewed as an attack on  Iranian soil and as a result any retaliation would be likely to come from Iran itself rather than Iranian allies according to a person associated with Hezbollah this was reported by The Washington Post so Iran is going to respond directly to show strength they want to basically scare Israel they even said earlier today that any response would be so severe that it would make Israel think twice about attacking Iran again this update was sponsored by my Patriot Supply guys my Patriot Supply has

food supply and the link is in the description below this video and an Iranian source told Reuters that Iran will be forced to respond in a serious way to deter Israel from repeating attacks okay so this is going to be a serious attack coming directly from Iran we know that Israel has been setting up GPS Jammers all over the country to try to throw off any G GPS guided missiles that Iran is going to be  launching a few days ago we had some intelligence come out that Iran was moving their long range missiles to the northern and western part of their country and Iran informed the us today through the Swiss Embassy in Tyran that it has decided to bomb Israeli objectives wow very serious guys and the president of Iran wrote on Twitter that zero hour is near and the prime minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu said today in response to all the Iranian threats that Israel can and will defend itself against any threat we will harm anyone  who wants to harm us wow and Biden and Netanyahu had a 45 minute phone call today and they discussed the threat from Iran and apparently Biden vowed to support Israel if they were to get attacked by Iran and right now at this hour we currently have US nuclear forces still on high alert we have a US nuclear war command and control plane up in the air over the Carolinas it's been up in the air all afternoon and all evening we also have a combat Sentinel plane that just took off from stratcom and it's  heading south looks like it might be going to the Gulf of Mexico and these planes are responsible for providing reconnaissance information directly to the president and the Joint Chiefs we only have two of these planes so for there to be one in the air is pretty unusual and it means that something is going on and then earlier today we had several doomsday planes in the air this evening we had another Doomsday plane fly from DC to Ohio that was the third Doom doomsday plane that was in the air today guys three presidential doomsday  planes in one day is insane and then we also had four nuclear war command and control planes in the air earlier okay so a total of four nuclear war command and control planes today and three presidential doomsday planes I cannot emphasize to you how serious that is and this was earlier today in the afternoon here are two of the Doomsday planes you can see one that took off from DC and went West over Kentucky and then there was another one over the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Corpus Christi and then  there was also a nuke sniffer plane in the air and then there was also a B2 stealth bomber that got aerially refueled over the Lake of the Ozarks in Missouri and this was actually a picture that was taken by a friend of mine and a Subs subscriber of the channel absolutely insane guys to have a B2 refueling aerially over the United States means that our bomber force is on maximum alert and they're getting ready to go to Iran and anihilate the Iranian military if they go overboard in their strike on Israel and last night there  were a bunch of Russian doomsday planes that flew to Siberia and the Euro mountains so this was probably Putin being moved to one of his Doomsday Bunkers in the urals OR in Siberia maybe he went to mount yantu maybe he went to kasinsky coming I don't know but this is extremely concerning seeing all these Russian doomsday planes here and then also three doomsday planes in the US earlier today so VIPs are being evacuated in the event that this war between Iran and Israel escalates and brings all the  great Powers into it here we have the tweet from the president of Iran and he wrote here that the zero hour is near and this tweet shows banners that have been put in Iranian cities and the banners say we take revenge and there's a picture of the Israeli defense minister here and some other high ranking Israeli military officials so I don't know if they're going to try to strike the Israeli military officials directly and try to assassinate them just how Israel assassinated the uh cuds Force leaders  but this is very very serious guys okay looks like they're going to try to take out the Israeli military leadership very serious here we have some video footage showing Israel evacuating some of their f-16s from various airbases and so they've basically deconstructed these f-16s and put them on flatbed trucks you can see they took the Wings off and this is literally just the body of the F-16 and they put them on flat beds so they could get them out of these air bases because they're afraid that Iran  is going to try to strike their air bases and destroy their f-16s okay so they've deconstructed them and they're moving them maybe into bunkers I want to remind you guys that Israel is a nuclear power a lot of people don't realize that but Israel does have nuclear weapons they have the Jericho missiles and their latest Jericho missile can reach Moscow okay the range is like 4,000 miles I believe and they also have fighter jet launched missiles that have nuclear warheads on them okay so if this escalates Israel could launch nukes at  Iran okay and the us could get involved Russia could then get involved I mean this could go sideways very very quickly and Israel is transferring an electronic warfare system to their Demona nuclear facility and if you don't know what the Demona nuclear facility is that's where the Israeli nuclear weapons program originated and that's their primary nuclear research facility that's where they enrich uranium for their nuclear weapons in the ngev desert so here you can see this electronic warfare system  being moved on a giant flatbed truck and oversized load okay check that out that is just absolutely insane how massive this machine is and it's for electronic warfare apparently so they obviously want to protect their nuclear facility from any Iranian ballistic missiles and follow following Iranian threats the alert level in Israeli embassies abroad has been moved to a maximum level some Israeli missions have also been evacuated following assessments by the shinb and the foreign Ministry we're hearing that seven Israeli embassies  have been evacuated in Bahrain Egypt Jordan Morocco and turkey okay so very tense situation guys we could wake up tomorrow to a World War and here we have some video footage coming out of Israel showing Israelis cleaning out grocery stores in preparation for this potential Iranian strike and also for a potential escalation between Israel and Iran and a possible World War so I'm going to continue to monitor the situation guys but it's really really serious and the Wall Street Journal reports that Emanuel  macron the president of France told the US and NATO that their troops wouldn't be needed if France sends its soldiers to Ukraine and that the French soldiers that come under attack by the Russian army would not need NATO and us protection okay so he's basically saying I'll do it alone I don't need any assistance I don't need you guys to back me up and the United Arab Emirates has announced suspension of all diplomatic ties with Israel we have some very concerning news about the bird flu it's continuing to spread apparently there  were some new outbreaks reported at two more dairy farms in Kansas and New Mexico raising the total number of outbreaks to 15 dairy farms there were also some dairy cows in Ohio that tested positive for the bird flu making it the sixth state to report cases apparently this Dairy operation in Ohio received cows from a Texas dairy farm where the bird flu originated from and scientists and experts are raising the alarm and warning that the bird flu could be 100 times worse than the covid-19 and potentially result in  fatalities of up to 50% of those infected on Wednesday the European food Safety Authority issued an alert noting that transmission between bird and mammal species has been observed particularly in fur Animal Farms where outbreaks have been reported these viruses continue to evolve globally and with the migration of wild birds new strains carrying potential mutations for Mamon adaptation could be selected if Aven influenza viruses acquire the ability to spread efficiently among large scale transmission could occur due to the lack  of immune defenses against H5 viruses in humans so very serious guys we have no natural immunity and it has a high fatality rate okay 50% maybe this is the disease X that they were talking about a few months back okay and Reuters reported that a scientific expedition in Antarctica found hundreds of dead penguins that were apparently killed from the h5n1 bird flu raising concerns that it could decimates threatened species of penguins and other animals wow and Ukraine launched a massive drone attack on Russia tonight there were  Kabooms heard in tagen Rog and rostov and they also launched a massive drone attack on the 559th guards bomber Aviation regiment based at the morosos Airfield which includes three squadrons of suco 34 fighter jets and we actually have some footage of that let me share this with you this is pretty intense you could see the drones coming in and going Kaboom and you can see the anti-air guns that are trying to shoot them down this is a Russian bomber base okay and apparently as many as 60 Kabooms were  reported at this bomber base so this was a very very serious drone attack so you can see the anti-air guns firing right there so very very serious situation and there were multiple fires reported in K Russia after a large-scale drone attack by Ukraine and Germany's defense Ministry has asked the German military to prepare for compulsory military service and US house representative from Texas Mike McCall says that National Security adviser Jake believes that Russia will launch a first nuclear strike against the  US and US house representative from Texas Mike McCall says that National Security adviser Jake Sullivan believes that Russia will launch a first nuclear strike against the United States if Ukraine is given too much military aid I want to show you guys some interesting flights this evening over the Baltic Sea we have this German air Force sub Hunter that was flying really close to kenrad and very low this is pretty unusual to see a German sub Hunter patrolling the Baltic Sea and we also had a US military  Blackhawk that was flying right off the coast of kenrad and I don't know if this is related to those Baltic exercises that Russia's doing with their Baltic Fleet apparently they're going to have like 10 warships and 1500 pieces of equipment participating in this exercise in the Baltic Sea they're going to practice going to a combat mode with their Baltic Fleet which is very suspicious because bellarus has put their military on combat alert so it could be related to some type of upcoming military action that bellarus  may take against Lithuania but to have a US black hawk fly this close to kenrad is extremely serious there was also a US sub Hunter plane flying in the Baltic Sea at the same time as the German sub Hunter and also at the same time as the US Blackhawk and the US has cancelled its latest oil Reserve refill plan for the US strategic petroleum Reserve which means that we're only going to have 17 days worth of oil in a crisis the energy department has been slowly refilling the emergency oil supply after it reached a  40-year low following the Biden administration's unprecedented draw down of a record amount of 180 million barrels in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine it currently holds about 363 million barrels and that's down from almost 600 million at the start of 2022 so that's really bad guys we've drawn down basically 50% of our strategic petroleum Reserve that is very very bad and finally want to just share some footage here from northern Maine this is coming from the Sugarloaf Mountain ski area in the moose head Lakes Region of  Maine and Maine got like 2 feet of snow over the last day or so and you can see here on these pictures how much snow there is so if any of you guys like to ski check out Sugarloaf Mountain in Maine I'm not sponsored by them just wanted to share these pictures here but that's the latest breaking news that I have I will be back tomorrow with more breaking news and if anything happens with Israel and Iran I will go live so until tomorrow take care God bless and don't forget the 3ps prepare practice and  persevere guys the world is getting Crazier by the day we're on the verge of World War III

A10	https://youtu.be/oO_dJOKoqoo?si=J5cDnWRaKJLGziU2	 A convicted rapist who is also facing charges of threatening the life of a local judge went before the Vermont Supreme Court this morning to make an appeal. News Channel 5's Mia Moran joins us now with the rest of this story. Mia. Stephanie, James Burke was charged with sexual assault in 2004, but his case didn't go to trial until 2010. That delay was just one of the arguments Burke tried to make, saying his conviction should be overturned.   511 Federal 3rd, 487 Fifth Circuit. Over the telephone, James Burke insisted he's innocent and his rape conviction should be reversed. This is clearly an unfair conviction. Totally unfair conviction. The 52-year-old pleaded his case before the state Supreme Court, arguing he was denied a speedy trial and evidence in his favor was thrown out by the judge. I have over 75 defense witnesses and they manipulated all my defense witnesses and all my defense.   This is a travesty of justice, a miscarriage of justice. You're a piece of   This was Burke last year after being sentenced to 18 to 20 years behind bars for the sexual assault of a young homeless woman. He yelled slurs at the judge and called the Chittenden County State's attorney corrupt. During his trial, Burke had consistent outbursts, fought with his own attorney, and taped an innocent sign to a box for the jury to see. We will appeal in this case. It's incorrect. I have evidence to prove myself innocent right here in this box.   In front of the Supreme Court justices, Burke only had 15 minutes to make his argument and spent most of it citing other cases. In response, the attorney general's office argued it was Burke who caused the delay in the trial by filing 178 motions.   He also spent many months searching for various experts without result. He filed multiple motions to recuse judges, which resulted in hearings being continued pending resolution. One month delay occurred after he physically threatened the deputy state's attorney at the end of a day of depositions. Now, it's likely it'll be months before the Supreme Court makes a decision in this case. In the meantime, Burke will remain behind bars. In the Vermont newsroom, Mia Moran, News Channel 5.

A102	https://youtu.be/lPdsJTF9LCs?feature=shared	it's a new movie that imagines what most of  us consider Unthinkable yet another American Civil War but talking with its star  Kirsten Dunst Ben Mankiewicz asks what [Applause] if America's darkest chapter has never  been far from Hollywood's vivid imagination with them goes the last semblance of Law and Order  from Gone With the Wind the Scavengers aren't wasting any time to glory state to Lincoln movies  have brought us the barbarity and the politics of the Civil War I can't accomplish a damn thing of  any human meaning or worth until we cure ourselves  of slavery and end this pestilential War but  what if that pestilential war was merely our first Civil War go go go go go that's the premise  of a new film called Civil War opening this week an unflinching and Relentless look we're American  okay at a nation divided and violent what kind of American are you not in the 1860s but today  you don't know does not feel like a sci-fi movie this could be us in pick a year 2025 2026  2024 is that fair hopefully not I mean but I do think it's a warning I do Kirsten Dunst leads  the cast playing a war photographer along with  three other journalists they drive from New  York to DC hoping to interview the president before Rebel forces led by Texas and California  reach the White House at the heart of all of this it's really about humanity and what happens  when people stop treating each other like human beings the lack of humanity in a few scenes is  shocking as we follow these reporters along the back roads encountering an America entirely  broken no rules no decency who's giving you orders and a coldblooded disregard for human  life someone's trying to kill us we are trying  to kill them why is the film unnerving and I  think the obvious reason it would appear to be unnerving is that it's a film about the product  of polarization and Division and Alex Garland an Englishman is Civil War's writer and director he  leaves unanswered questions of how the war begins and to some extent who the good guys are we're  left with a movie that's intentionally vague Garland wanted this story seen Through The Eyes  of reporters even though a colleague told him that was box office poison they said don't make a  film about journalists everybody hates journalists  and I thought that was a really interesting thing  to say it's sort of like saying everybody hates doctors you can't hate doctors because you  need doctors and actually any we kind of know any healthy country needs journalists it needs it  needs freedom of the press today the audience will certain be talking about the film's president who  we learn is serving a third term and has abolished the FBI some are already calling it The Greatest  victory in the history of military campaigns he's played by Nick Offerman who says the character  was not inspired by any commander-in-chief past  or present Offerman does say the film offers  a warning that given today's political climate Americans need to heed our ego and our history  wants to allow us to believe that we're above such things that you know lesser countries around  the world may engage in but we're we're Americans you know we drink the finest Cola beverages we're  immune to such things there's an underlying truth with everything difficult which is nobody's immune  are you guys are there's like a pretty huge civil war going on all across America seeing this happen  here is an unsettled Experience One shared by  the cast including Wagner Moura himself a former  journalist and Cailee Spaeny spy two of the three reporters traveling with Kirsten Dunst oh my God  like like why didn't I just tell him not to shoot them they're probably going to kill them anyway  it was the first time that I felt like the message really went through me you know it felt like a gut  punch and I came out of it feeling like I want to take action you know that I don't want it to ever  get to this point I'm really making an effort to  sit down and listen to people that I disagree  and I was absolutely surprised to see that if you value democracy if you think that democracy  is an important thing then there lots of common ground and I I personally have never felt the way  I felt coming out of the theater and I was in the movie and I was just as shocked it felt like it  was meant to be I had never had that experience in in a film before for Kirsten Dunst that's  saying something she's been in movies since she was a kid Landing her first meaty role at 12 she's  not opposite Tom Cruz and Brad Pitt in Interview  with a Vampire do you want forever big teen movies  followed the Virgin Suicides and bring it on then three Spider-Man films in 2022 Dunst earned an  Oscar nomination for her aching performance in power of the dog now 35 years into the business  she knows Civil War is unlike anything she's done before I'd never played a role like this I think  that this is one of the most important films that I've ever been a part of I think that it respects  the audience and lets them put their own beliefs onto what's happening you're saying it's about  the audience what does that mean in this case  for this film I think it's up to the individual  to take whatever their political beliefs are and they will imprint watching the film what it  makes them feel or whose side is what side and and I think that's really interesting and we'll  get a lot of conversations that we need to have happen and that's the beautiful thing about art  it's like that's what you want to be a part of in film making is to push boundaries and and um give  something that no one's seen before because I I haven't seen a film like this before whatever the  audience Pro it will come with a degree of unease  in a country that has always been comforted by  the notion that this could never happen here not again unless we come to our senses our polarized  divisive non-communicative accusatory state is going to continue unless we do something about  it I hope as many people see it as possible and I hope that it it helps us slowly trudge ourselves  towards uh trying to find decency in our society and supporting that and turn and turning our  backs on the forces that that make us look in the other direction and can lead us to things  like what happens in this movie that divide us  yeah

A104	https://youtu.be/nFbAm1fJ7Xc?feature=shared	I left the UK 14 months ago with nothing but a bag some condoms and a dream and uh my life has completely changed since I moved to Thailand so I'm going to tell you exactly how I did it visa stuff accommodation how do you move out here and why is heaven on Earth for a young man why is literally the freest place that you can live why I absolutely love Thailand and why any young man who can should move out here whilst it is still the absolute dream that it is today so boys without further Ado let's get into  the video let's get some more of you Legends out to Thailand when I moved to Thailand I found it very difficult to find anyone similar to me as a guy that was given advice on how to get here and I just moved my story of how I got to Thailand is I was living in the UK I left my job I'd saved up 10 grand 10 000 pounds about 12 and a half thousand dollars and I just decided one day I said look I've had enough I'm gonna go to Thailand I had no idea how to do the Visas I didn't have a clue what I was doing I just got on a  plane I didn't know a single person it was in the middle of covid I just managed to get here and I decided to figure it all out for myself now 14 months later I'm still here and I've had the best time of my life and I figured out a hell of a lot of stuff about Thailand and why it's awesome how to move here and this is the video I wish I'd had when I was thinking about moving that would have just made me more assured and more comfortable with coming over here really so now since I've been here 14 months I've changed massively as  a person and I I've put a lot of that down to the experience that Thailand's given me so this was my first ever ride when I first got here I decided to rent a motorbike and I've never ridden a motorbike before but you don't need to have a motorbike license I didn't have a YouTube channel I'd 5K debt by this point April I got her in January I spent my money fairly fast and I got a credit card so I was down creek really and uh I was trying to figure it out for myself and then 10 months later I I do thirty  thousand dollar months through my online business 1250 CC motorbike I got a hell of a lot better at riding bikes I've got 78 000 YouTube subs and I think a lot of this is down to the things I did but also the fact that I was living in Thailand so I'm going to explain to you boys basically how I did it the reason Thailand changed my life so much is because when you come here you are pushed out of your comfort zone you have to become a new person and you'll no longer afraid of becoming that person because there's  no one around you that you know and everybody here is so nice and kind and accepting that you can very easily become the person you need to be so I ended up here a little bit lost and navigated for a while and got a little bit lost in the source a little bit too much booze but then I very much got on in tune with who I was I became the guy needed to be I started making daily content on YouTube I started showing my life in Thailand I started showing the way I was viewing the world and that is what grew this channel now I didn't  realize until I actually got here how bad the West is how bad the UK is the the problem with the West is everyone is up in your everyone speaks the same language they're always bothered about what you're doing they're trying to get involved can't do that you can't do this feminism feminism feminism drink soy milk drink soy milk here have some vegan stuff that's the West all over I'm learning don't don't say anything bad you can't swear parking ticket parking ticket caught on camera doing this speeding speeding  you've used your phone wrong you've taken a call in the car blah blah blah court date court date have this have that that's the West all over it's it's completely oh by the way this has tax on it this has tax on it pay this tax pay that tax you can't do this you can't do that oh my God that is not fun for me that is not fun I can't handle it I'm not I don't know how to deal with it all the bills you have to pay all the stuff life is not simple in the west everyone's looking at you you're part of the wrong place you get a  ticket you don't pay it you end up in court it's it's messed up it's very messed up I have problems with rules I'm sorry Thailand thank is still free if you are a foreigner here learning earning income online into the country there's some interesting ways you can set up your tax which I'll discuss inside my gentleman's club and mentorship group we have a big group of us in Thailand we are connected together so if you are a guy that is a wants to be an online entrepreneur you need help with visas or tax situations that sort  of stuff you need someone to ask and it's a very much an interest to you check out the link below and you can come and join us but in Thailand thank you're still free you're just left alone there's no real cameras there's no speed in a parking ticket there's no real issues if you have an issue with somebody it's normally just a small fine to pay and you can get on with your day it's no problem at all you just if you're not causing any trouble if you're just being I don't want to cause trouble I just want to be me I just want to have  fun I just want to swing from the trees I'm trying to climb a couple of trees a day I just want to ride my motorbike sometimes without a helmet on and if I get caught here no problem okay I've paid the fine and I'm back on my way caught in the UK oh you gotta go your bike's been taken you've got to go to court Thailand thank God God bless praise this country is still a free place to live you're not getting Council taxes in the in the in the post you're not getting issues like that you're not getting  phone bills and direct debits and stuff it just doesn't exist and freedom for me and a lot of other men is number one and Thailand is Paramount for that you are absolutely free in this country and that is the problem with the West is the rules and regulations here people are Carefree they don't care what you're doing as long as you keep them to yourself you're not harming anyone and that is what I love about Thailand so pretty much what I just said but this is why Thailand's Paradise to me as I said climbing a few  trees a day is me climbing the coconut tree just minding my own business enjoying a Cuban as a free man sitting in a nice place drinking reasonably priced water because I don't really drink booze anymore but smoking a very nice Cuban drinking nice water eating a nice steak at a reasonable price in a beautiful climate with beautiful women that are interesting and lovely and don't speak my language so they are not incredibly annoying here we go we've got some Lads from the gentleman club riding ATVs just  absolutely gunning it through the jungle together doing stuff like that you just you've got too much health and safety in the west they wouldn't let us do half the stuff we're popping weenies we're we're spinning out the back we're doing donuts they don't care you fall off you around each other they don't care there is none of this that goes on in the west another reason why Thailand's absolutely fantastic martial arts every man should be doing martial arts and it's very encouraged here and it's very fun Muay Thai is incredible  Sun scene sex what more can you want you want to be looking cool you want to be looking like a surfer dude straight off the beach nice tan sex with beautiful women coconuts very good for you great 5G has to be mentioned if you're online entrepreneur you can get 5G anywhere upload YouTube videos from anywhere from your phone with a hotspot bangkok's epic epic City I don't live there I live in Koh Samui but Bangkok is an epic City you can do anything there you can shop for anything there it's awesome no need for a motorbike license  no need for fancy rules I recommend getting an international license otherwise you could have some trouble getting pulled over but you can ride a motorbike without having to do a motorbike course here is what I mean and Ladies come here to find themselves women from all over the world come here to find themselves and go on holiday and they find themselves in my bed and they will find themselves in your bed if you want them to be there plus Thai women are beautiful amazing lovely women if you know how to navigate relationships  and you are a dominant guy you will you'll get on very well in Thailand and you will enjoy a lot so what you've all been waiting for how the hell do you actually do it how do you actually move here what value am I going to give you how I did it so I decided to just book a ticket and leave because it was too complicated for me to do on the internet I'm gonna run you through the options you currently have so at the moment you could buy a ticket from pretty much I'm gonna do for the UK this might apply to  others but from the UK you can buy a ticket to Thailand one way you're going to get into Bangkok at Bangkok you can get a visa on arrival for 45 days you'll be able to stay in the country and whilst you're in the country you can extend for another 30 days no no problem no questions asked so you've got 75 days off the bat I recommend anyone thinking of coming to Thailand you do that you don't need to do the paperwork before you come just arrive at the door get you get your visa on arrival come into the country see if you like it if  you're working online you've got money coming in don't come here looking for a job without a Visa don't come here trying to find work that's not what it's about it's about bringing money into the economy helping the tires helping boost this wonderful place so if you've got money coming in online and you want to come to Thailand just come and move it you can work from your laptop you've got 75 days here to see if you like it try a few places out I'd recommend you try kosamuri copangan if you're more of a  hippie I wouldn't personally stay there Phuket Chiang Mai Chiang Rai Bangkok check them out see what you think go on a little tour that's your first thing or you can choose one and settle down start working on your laptop totally up to you what I'd recommend you use to book your first accommodations is a there's a website called Agoda which operates here it's like a travel website very good for finding finding rooms you can find apartments Great hotels stays all different sorts of stuff so when you  first get it you can do that I would recommend doing that for a week and when you get to the island that you want to go to or the place you're thinking of settling down just reach out and find an estate agent join the Facebook groups in that area spend your first seven days in the hotel and then find longer term accommodation you'll find it very easily it's very Carefree you just get it all done no problem if you need help with accommodation I do have connections I've got estate agents everything I've helped a lot of guys in  our Gentleman's Club move to Thailand now I know great great Visa connections great um accommodation connections where to live where where the best places are can give full advice so if you want to join the gentleman's club you're interested in that you want to speak to me on Zoom we have a mentorship and gentleman's club which is down below you can check that out but what I recommend you do is that so you come here and you get the 75 days you find some accommodation once you've arrived at the place you decide to be  you use a Golder for your booking to get that hotel and then you find your longer term rental once you are here and you want to extend your Visa you have a few options what you need to do is find a Visa company inside Thailand so some of you might be you might be a little bit scared you might think what if I'd come here and then after 75 days I can't stay don't worry just know this in your head there's always a way in Thailand they're not going to kick you out you're making money you're staying and you're spending  it in their economy they don't want to get rid of you they want to keep you here so you just look for a Visa person in your area ideally after 75 days you connect your mates and connections you speak to somebody who's already done it they give you the advice and the connection you end up paying a thousand dollars or one and a half thousand dollars for a Year's Visa that's a connection that I can do currently um and you can stay here you can get education visas longer stay visas absolutely fine I do not recommend  overstaying without getting a Visa that's a very bad idea you don't ever want to do that but if you connect and you speak to people as you're going around you will find a way to get a Visa so you don't need to be worried about that if you obvious see if you want my contacts if you want to know a way to find online work before you come out here if you're trying to leave the nine to five all of that stuff we help you do inside the gentleman's club a couple of ways I recommend one of the best ones  you can do is a sales job online we have a sales Academy inside the gentleman's club training you up and then showing you how to find opportunities in online sales we do that in the gentleman's club but I'd recommend if you've got some sales experience just find an online closing role where you are closing for someone online you can run a marketing agency online you can do content creation you can do online fitness coaching there's a whole load of different options and the beautiful thing about Thailand is you need about  two thousand dollars a month to live a comfortable life out here obviously you can spend more you can spend way way more but if you've got that you can live a comfortable life here and you can build your business out here and it gives you that Dynamic so boys I hope that's helped you I hope you've enjoyed that video and I hope to see a lot of you in Thailand I think it's absolutely the best place on Earth God bless the king in Thailand God bless Thai people I absolutely love them and I'll be staying here for the  foreseeable future I absolutely love it so boys I hope to connect with a lot of you in the gentleman's club be cool we run a lot of events out here in Thailand so if you are around be sick to connect apart from that boys I will see you on the next one 	Leaning Liberal			Conservative	8
A108	https://youtu.be/u8qEAMsHiRU?si=GXTPz7vWwlP8jDP_	did you know there's an entire underground butt Market where you can go to buy injections for your keester and they're administered by people that aren't actually qualified to be giving them they're not medical professionals and yesterday a mother and daughter Duo got arrested for this they' travel around and give people some injections into their tokus to try and Elevate their ass game to the next level and they would have got away with it too if it wasn't for those meddling medical license required ments you can't really  just go around giving people medical procedures unless you're qualified to do so for the obvious reason of it's dangerous people die from it all the time from botched procedures even something as simple as getting your butt cheeks blasted here with whatever substance they were administering which they're still investigating what they even giving them for all we know they could have been dishing out bbls using Play-Doh in a syringe blasting like hamburger meat into their butt like there's no telling it could have been anything but  anyway they made a public appearance yesterday uh right now they're out on bail but I'll I'll introduce you to goof and goober here real quick consuello Maria delbo made her first appearance in a Harris County court yesterday she faces a felony drug charge and a misdemeanor of practicing medicine without a license dalbo spoke with our news Partners in Houston while out on bond she says her passion is helping people and boosting their confidence believe me Everything I Do I Do It With My Heart and everybody who knows me they know me  sometime I do it because they really need it what a bunch of fish paste what do you mean she's making it sound like she's some kind of saint for doing this as if it's like a required procedure that some people need but just can't afford you and your daughter were just praying on people's insecurities to make a fat payday you were charging thousands of dollars to show up to their residents with a mystery liquid and a syringe that could have just been turkey gravy for all we know no one needs an ass booster  she's trying to frame this like she was doing a good deed or a valuable service you weren't unless there was someone born without butt cheeks and they can't sit down cuz they just slide off the chairs or if they lay down in bed they just squeak off the side or something there's nobody in the world that needs this done look at the mother and daughter in Texas who got arrested for illegally giving people butt injections bootle bbl's oh this is 9 hours ago mother and daughter accused of Performing illegal  butt injections arrested in sting operation in Texas that'll get you every time getting your BBL from wish mother and daughter accused of Performing illegal butt injections without any medical expertise were arrested in Texas Consuelo dalbo 56 and her daughter Isabella dalbo 18 have been charged with practicing medicine without a license a Mis how is that only a misdemeanor like that is that should be so much more severe well I know a misdemeanor can be pretty severe though I mean that's that's big stuff  practicing medicine without a license like come on come on people die from this court documents revealed a women went to a home to perform the butt injections on a customer who was actually an undercover peace officer they plan to charge 6,000 for the service are they calling them peace officers now instead of police is this like some kind of Rebrand or something why are they calling him a piece officer that's some Hunger Game the woman the women apparently were not even sure what was in the injectables described as an unlabeled  brown liquid a motion for bail written by Harris County District's Attorney office said this fundamentally demonstrates how remarkably dangerous these acts were Consuelo Dalo allegedly provided a Zan xanx Jesus Christ provided his Annex to the prospective customer for the purpose of relaxing her before the injections began the women were ultimately arrested separately in the sting authorities also confiscated bags containing the illegal injectables and medical equipment they were accused of traveling across the country to give  clients these illegal injections the investigation into the pair was conducted by Houston Police Department's major offenders division Food Drug Administration agents what a long title and Homeland Security they're prohibited from practicing medicine without a license as I think anyone in the world would be in 2021 police said a mother and daughter Duo were charged with a murder in California after they performed a botched butt injection that resulted in the October 2019 death of 26-year-old Karissa Raj Paul police said  that the mother and daughter had no medical certification it was believed neither had any type of training the jury found them guilty of involuntary manslaughter last month also in 2021 a Dallas woman was sentenced to 5 years in prison for causing a nightclub dancer's death by performing an illegal butt injection on her in Missouri in 2015 bro these butt injections get you every time that's like a speedrun to meet your maker the butt has a lot of nerves and some important veins if I remember correctly so if it's performed badly  like this can happen this can H this can happen with any kind of procedure though from someone that's not actually licensed there was a Instagram model actually she might have just been like a full-blown big model I can't remember who died after a botched knee surgery that was supposed to like remove a little like what was it a little cartilage around her knee cuz she didn't like the way her knees looked so this can just happen anywhere if you're being tended to by a less than qualified [Music]  professional that's what it was removing fat from her knee that's what it was and it was a Brazilian influencer who suffered cardiac arrest after lipos suction on her knee went wrong which is a crazy procedure to get in the first place removing some fat from your knee you kidding me there was also that billionaire who died after getting a penis injection to make his dick bigger why a billionaire died during penis enlargement oh yeah this was in 2019 it was a Diamond Trading billionaire his name was Ehud R  Leno are you kidding me I

A190	https://youtu.be/x81gguSPGcQ?si=1ObPPSDkCVQDJB2j	right pearl you'd be called the female Andrew Tate how do you plead well I take it as a compliment people think I'm insane because I don't think women should vote I had this realization the men are smarter and better at everything women have been told what we want to hear our whole Liv from a historical perspective women are pretty [Music] [Music] bad 90% of women have been body count is so I understand the complaint when you search the word pearl on Google you get the definition of a small glistening sphere formed within  the crystalline shell of an oyster highly regarded for its beauty and rarity as a [Music] jewel but if you search Pearl on YouTube you get this what up guys welcome to the just pearly things YouTube channel today I want to talk about why women are dumb how women love realize that the only way we can be great at things is under the authority of a man just pearly things is a 26-year-old YouTuber Tik tocker and social commentator with a knack for anti-Semitism who isn't afraid to give her opinion on the appearances of  teenage girls all in an effort to promote the red pill a community I pray will one day Fade Into deep obscurity my husband's texting me he wanted me to tell you that we will have our daughter ready for you as a virgin these influencers alongside Pearl can be recently seen advocating against the 19th amendment I don't think women should vote huh I don't think women should vote Lord Jesus keep on going making bold claims about what women really want I swear to God this show has made me believe I think women like to be  cheated on and pushing to criminalize a person's legal option to get divorced actually I think we should ban divorce too yeah I think that should be banned yes okay well that's a little bit silly you have to acknowledge that right no something you'll hear these people often espouse is that women are expected to adhere to a very strict set of arbitrary guidelines in order to be considered desirable or high value this is a notion Pearl subscribes to as well only the difference between Pearl and her contemporaries is that she if you  haven't noticed is a woman a token of femininity floating across a vast sea of t testosterone yearning desperately for a crumb of credibility even if it means existing only to attack and demean or her own group which is a long way of saying Pearl isn't like the other girls because she's worse let's just be honest we're basically like big kids right that can just be propagated and like you can push us to do things by feeding into the delusions and biases of the most annoying people on the planet Pearl gets  to go viral on Twitter book Prime Time television interviews sell painfully Young creative merch and produce some of the laziest most unedited content I've seen in my life maybe you guys I can't find it maybe she genuinely sees her work as an act of good or maybe it's possible that Pearl is only doing all of this to feel a sense of Pride and acceptance that she herself has never received because believe it or not Pearl wasn't always like this before all the hate and Desperation that plagues Her  Image today Pearl's life actually seemed far less polarizing just a couple years ago hey guys today I am here with my sister Eva and she is going to give a chicken co [Music] tour I don't need no validation I don't need no validation yeah yeah yeah okay you don't need no valid except from Tik Tok a lot of you guys have been asking questions so I kind of ended up being like a full-time Tik Tok like YouTuber by accident I can actually show you any of Pearl's original Tik toks because her first account was banned along with her  second account her third account her fourth fifth yeah you get it Pearl gets banned a lot two years of work 930,000 followers and I have been officially banned I got banned off of Tik Tok I got banned they banned account number three but you can't get rid of me baby you can't get rid of me baby account number four I still got banned free just pearly things give me my account back in fact pear is now on her eighth Tik Tok attempt at least at the time of me recording this maybe when this vid finally comes out she'll be on her ninth  I mean God knows it wouldn't be surprising but as sad as I am to be missing out on what I'm sure is some valuable content so I said you're a whale you're a whale you're a whale you could say maybe the whale was too far but she was a bigger woman we could still get a good idea of what Pearl was like in 2020 by turning over to her YouTube channel where she's attained close to 2 million subscribers and over 900 million total views just over the past 2 years of course most of those views aren't totally meaningful cuz  considering they're from YouTube shorts which rarely translate over to active subscribers or substantial ad Revenue but we'll discuss all that in a bit it's true that Pearl owes much of her notoriety to the likes of Andrew Tates and fresh and fit who she has collaborated with on a number of occasions during her tenure in the red pill Community podcasting alongside inebriated sex workers sex traffickers and Nazis welcome Nick Fuentes but when we look back on some of her earliest uploads we can see Pearl was actually  once pretty far removed from the characters who make up the manosphere in fact I doubt she even knew who any of them were back when she was making things like my first Vlog a trip to Florida chicken coup tour wrong wrong spelling and mansion house tour 10 bedrooms okay so I'm going to show you the front of the house see Pearl herself comes from a very wealthy sheltered background in Chicago with both of her parents Dan and Jennifer Davis being quite accomplished software engineers in their own right Jennifer being listed as  the former CEO of davisware a multi-million dollar company the couple founded together she's now the CEO of another organization she founded to be exponential which is described as an online community seeking to provide tangible and realistic advice to women and mothers specifically in navigating Parenthood or Life as a whole their website also mentions that b exponential was built by women for women which is an interesting footnote considering the kinds of things Pearl has been known to advocate for as of recent for instance  Pearl believes men it solely built Society by themselves therefore it must be impossible for women to be oppressed because the men have already solved everything men built the world world men built the world for women to just on them in the world that they built they built a society that's safe there's no Wars we have the place to protect us when they talk about women being oppressed it's it's wrong it's not correct she doesn't actually believe men and women are equal she's very open about this I think there something evil  about telling women we're equal to men because it demasculate the men and it harms the women too because it takes away the one thing we need which is Guidance the more I think the more I'm like gosh the natural world world order has has to be men women children maybe government I haven't decid I have to think more about that one The Men We reproduce with must be superior [Music] because they create everything important it doesn't seem like we really do much if we don't follow the natural order of  the world and we're left to our own devices so maybe I'm just a sexist are my eyebrows good guys so there's no reason for them to have equal roles in society I guess in fact Pro believes women tend to do more damage by being in the workforce whenever we take over an industry we just like ruin it it's so sad we'll like BAS everything off our feelings and like add an HR departments take away the competitiveness of Industries in the last 100 years women have really taken over education and you know what  happened when we took over education everyone got Dumber now they have a teacher and a teacher's aid two women cannot teach the way one man used to teach that's how bad it is that's why I don't think therapy works when they're women like women are just going to comfort you they're going to tell you what you want to hear where men will tell you how to fix it but the problem is like women we never want to fix it like actually fix it yeah maybe um ban women from the police force if women's jobs disappeared  tomorrow society would probably be fine but if men's jobs disappeared tomorrow it would be rough out there yet here is her own mom essentially proving her wrong having built up a number of successful organizations written a best-selling book and still managed to look after and provide for 10 children all at once though Pearl has also attempted to weirdly diminish her mother's accomplishments and role in the company insisting she was never the CEO despite Jennifer's website claiming the opposite she may have also accidentally  admitted to your parents committing fraud but that's besides the point wasn't your mom the president was she the leader of the company what was my you're researching my family now huh they might have titled it one thing or another they did that to get some Grant from the government or something I don't remember but so in this yeah is that a crime yeah you probably shouldn't say that on a the main takeaway here is that Pearl got to experience a lavish childhood as a result of her parents both having  high-paying jobs in fact one of the times Pearl first blew up was thanks to a Tik Tok she made about a giant water slide her dad bought her and her siblings yeah some people just live a completely different life than the rest of us I know why she thinks a Lamborghini costs 50 Grand but this was Pearl's first taste of online stardom a glimpse into a life where she didn't have to work a corporate job with kanuk Manola selling printers a position she absolutely hated and it was literally like the worst sales job of my life like  I hated it I hated it so much but if she had never sold printers we never would have gotten these wonderful song parodies she posted to LinkedIn we just took a DNA test turns out we're 100% the best even when we're going crazy cuz we do see problems that's a human in US bling bling then we solve them that's a Salesman in US I'm starting to see why she dated working there call me on my work all day need yeah you know Co was a weird time for all of us I'll just say that is Pearl from conica I'll help you save  till I can't no more we got the printers in the back it's still better than her recent music feminism is the worst thing ever yeah we get our money yeah we get our job yeah we dumped our high school heart throb but then we end up alone on anti-depressant all alone Pearl spent much of her pre- internet days playing sports boasting about how she was a three sport athlete in college in fact her original plan was to join a program that would allow her to move to Europe and play basketball while completing a  master's degree until the program fell through leaving her more time to post on Tik Tok this is how she accidentally became a full-time influencer then the season gets canceled again so I'm just like kind of left like with no job no real plan and just like I don't even know what I'm going to do next but I'm going to take you guys with me you'll see what happens something that immediately stood out to me when I was first watching these older videos is how differently Pearl carries herself here compared to now trading in her Lakers  hoodies and sweatbands for more of a Trad wife look that these red pill guys go for maybe these are all just my own observations of course but I can't help but think I'm watching two different people here I blew up on Tik Tok because I was really blessed cuz my parents just have like really cool stuff my dad's like nuts so he bought this like big water slide from a water park and I just told the story of how the town didn't want him to put him up I think the women are dumber than the men because I think  our emotions just get in the way we're too emotional we see a problem problem we get emotional about it where the men can just think maybe she's just not as passionate about the stuff she talks about today I haven't seen you talk to a actual scholar once you just talk to kind of random women right I mean that's fair to say right so when you say you talk to feminists you me just mean like random women off the street not like a scholar that say that say they're feminist I mean after all this really isn't her  forte unlike Andrew Tate Pearl hasn't quite dedicated Decades of her life to misogyny just yet she only picked it up recently when I first started watching red pill content I didn't always like it guys they're saying girls are we're fat and we bring basically nothing to the table nowadays but the more I listened to the content and really thought about my experience in the world I couldn't really say that they were wrong according to one article I found from 2020 Pearl was first gaining traction on Tik Tok after just several  months of creating her account her initial claim to fame being her breakup quiz Series in which she wrote a bunch of questions that viewers could then send to their ex Partners to fill out for Pearl to post publicly and it was pretty successful too posting the best answers from a pool of nearly 9,000 submissions telling Yahoo I try to post the most appropriate ones I know there are kids on this app so the bigger I get the more I try to keep it PG damn I wonder what she stopped caring about that what if you've only had one part  but you had 10 abortions you were a stripper and you had only fans not a this article though also makes sure to note that Pearl herself has yet to send the quiz to anyone in her past considering she's never actually been in a real relationship Pearl stating I actually have not had a boyfriend that was serious enough for me to send it to hence why I had my followers take it the only long-term relationship I can think of is a guy I talked to for a couple years in college which in itself is totally f fine and normal everyone moves  at their own pace and there's no shame in dating later in life except Pearl might slightly disagree just because you're 35 and you're single doesn't mean you'll be single at 40 at 60 at 70 but the problem is at 35 you've lost all the things that men value that that's the problem cuz men men value femininity fertility and they value youth so you can't say you're youthful when you're almost halfway through your life like you can't say you're fertile when you're you're you're about to have geriatric  pregnancy so it's like and you look worse than you did at at 25 right so the way you're thinking is like a woman not to mention it's almost been 3 years since this article was published and to my knowledge Pearl still has yet to be in an actual long-term relationship though there was the time she briefly dated the angry Tik Tock reaction guy not for very long her ex-best friend of 22 years Emily says that despite her brief time with angry reactions Pearl has still never had a serious relationship has she  ever been engaged no never and she's never even been in a serious relationship like honest to God she I mean her and one like that wasn't even a like that doesn't even count at all because what was that and that's where we run into a bit of a problem Pearl someone who has evidently never been married never been engaged never even held down a boyf for longer than a few months still somehow has the nerve to tell other women what to do in their relationship ships publicly it's her job to do that a huge  part of her brand relies on judging other people's marriages from afar Pearl likes the idea of being married she wants a family someday and wants to have kids but does that by itself mean she's a reliable source on how a marriage needs to work what exactly gives her the right to tell others how they're doing things wrong when she herself hasn't even experienced a relationship the way she thinks she wants it Pearl's relationship advice might as well be completely discarded even by her own metric I've noticed a lot of  therapists are like older single women and I'm kind of like if you can't maintain a relationship why would I take advice from you I'm just this is just something I've noticed yeah like why would I take advice from you if you can't maintain relationship as Pearl continued to solidify her position in the dating community on Tik Tok she eventually discovered a man named Kevin Samuels another influencer Who Rose to prominence around this time for his videos on relationships which were a tad bit on the controversial side but if you  ad made it to 35 years old and you're unmarried you are leftover woman it's cheating when you do it you're cheating we don't we just have sex women like you die alone okay maybe a lot bit on the controversial side but this is who introduced Pearl to the red pill Nam dropping him in a video for the first time in 2021 where she discussed several of his beliefs specifically his philosophy on cheating people cheat right obviously if you have more OPP to you get more likely to do it but it's just weird to me because when I grew up  like my dad was never like that see a lot of this stuff was extremely foreign to Pearl given that her dad never fit the mold Kevin Samuels often talked about in referencing men her dad never drank never smoked never cheated so this kind of rhetoric coming from the Manos feere was like a glimpse into a whole new world one that Pearl was clearly willing to explore this video in particular may seem from the title that she's challenging Kevin's belie but she more so just kind of says a bunch of words for 5 minutes I think a lot of  people cheat because of like situations that they put themselves in um so I don't know if that's like a disagreement or what in my notes for this one I just wrote down godamn she Rambles she doesn't even make much of a point here LMAO does that make sense I don't know if I Mak I'm half paying attention to driving half paying attention to you guys to further acquaint herself with this community she very much began consuming as much of their content as she could listening to their arguments and regurgitating their  talking points on her own platforms okay fourth thing I've learned from the manosphere and I'm not going to talk about if this is true or not true women are always willing to leave you for a better option women today are less marriageable than ever before like women can and will take all of your money women will do things like withhold sex if they don't do like chores or something she was so excited to share what she had learned in fact that she even brought her family into the mix which had some varying results today I  have a special guest on the channel my little sister Amelia she's super excited to be here I'm going to be showing her some of Kevin Samuel's Savage moments because she would not she was not willing to sit down for a full clip so yeah her sister does not give even a single just please let her go do you think women get upset at men a lot depends do you think they say things like men are trash a lot do you think that's okay sometimes really really depends on the guy you're talking about do you think but in  general do you think that's okay like men are trash men are trash like just in general I don't know I don't really have an opinion on that kind of stuff I mean sitting your 13-year-old sister down in front of a laptop and forcing her to watch fresh and fit is bad enough they're kind of um they're kind of players a little bit you ready stop looking like I'm torturing you why the hell are you going to pay full price for a goddamn car that been used if I'm going to invest into you I need to know you are not used man what  does your YouTube feed look like on a daily T it literally looks like this stuff it's like men's dating advice you are so single someone had to say it but why are you also exposing her to the repulsion that is your community I mean these comments are insane she has no life in her she's going to do hard drugs when she gets older she for sure is not attracting anyone in life she will die alone I'm not sure if she's strictly heterosexual your sister is clueless like no man she's just a teenager who  doesn't want to watch Kevin Samuels videos at 2: in the morning is that so unreasonable so that was Kevin Samuels what did you think did you think what he said was true or false I don't know if I tried showing my little sister some of Pearl's videos I think she' decked me in the face I prefer Kevin Samuels to fresh and Fit I prefer Minecraft youtubers watching Pearl try to get regular people on board with her new belief system is truly a sight to Behold a girl will only love a guy like that's like the best she  can get but if she has a better option like that makes more money is more attractive is like just a better allaround option she'll leave her current like boyfriend or husband for them oh I mean just here you could tell her friend isn't nearly as invested in this conversation as Pearl is basically the candy store analogy is like C sex is candy and girls get it right away but most guys don't have access to sex till their late 20s early 30s so if you get married like before that they think that like girls should put up with cheating  basically I know because like it's not fair to the guys because like now at 35 they finally put out their money right they got to the gym for 5 years did all this stuff now they get have sex with a lot of people so why would they only settle for one well then why did they get married come on Candy Store analogy if you tried saying that to any person who doesn't frequent incel Forums on fortun you're going to sound insane when you have to keep telling your friend not to read any of what the chat is saying  on your own live stream you know you're cultivating a really awesome fan base you can't you can't read the comment yeah you can't read the comments too like you can't which of course has only gotten better with time 73 % of these people don't think gay people should adopt 76% think trans people should be institutionalized I mean what the are these questions Pearl it's no surprise that when you confront someone in the real world with these kinds of talking points you don't get much of a positive response are women really that  smart they are I think we're all equal oh you think we're equal I think the men are smarter say so H Pearl has lost lifelong friendships over the takes her ex-best friend we mentioned earlier Emily being amongst the most vocal after Pearl publicly lied about her being too fat to get pregnant so Hannah and I were friends from 2002 prek until last year when I stopped being friends with her so in the beginning of her video she's talking about our last conversation we had a year ago in March where I  confronted her about talking about women's bodies and their weight and all that cuckoo bird she talks about and I was like are you okay are you okay and no she defended at all so I was like okay we're we're done I'm sorry I'm sorry I mean these two were close friends there's no disputing it Pearl is duding herself to the point that it's affecting her personal life just like how sneo family didn't invite him to Christmas on account of his batshit opinions do you know that um this is the first year uh I'm not going home for  Christmas they don't my like I I have blue hair woke family kind of like you and they they don't me with my politics at all I mean it doesn't take a Blu hair people to not want to with your politics like the it's never got to the point it's never got to the point where I've been like Uninvited for Christmas I hate to break it to you but normal people don't give so much of a sh about chronically online manosphere garbage like whether or not women should give back their rights in reality these conversations are so inherently  ridiculous and inconsequential compared to what the average American is dealing with we're living in a country where 30 million people are without health insurance millions of already employed people are having to work multiple jobs just to put food on the table almost half the population can't even afford a decent home I mean you see how these conversations Pearl wants to have are kind of silly I get the irony of me sitting here making a video on her but my brain is broken so of course I'll indulge her arguments a little bit I  just want to be sure that we're keeping this whole mess in perspective at least like man people are just trying to make it through the day the last thing anyone wants to do is listen to Just pearly things tell them what age disqualifies women from finding a partner who cares also asking this person about age probably isn't the best idea what the was she cooking here not that it's literally any excuse that she's doing this because what she is doing I can't even put into words how disgusting it is  but I've known her since 2002 that I do not think she thinks that way if she does her all over again I don't care but I don't think she does I think she does it to rev people up and to get more views and to get more money so all that to say I'm curious to see once she does find a husband and find a man is she going to keep this act up cuz is she going to find somebody that shares these exact views with her or is she going to meet someone and be like okay I don't actually think this way according to both Emily and angry  reactions Pearl's bizarre obsession with churning out the most mind-numbing takes imaginable seem to happen overnight cuz a lot of people be in my comments be like she had to have been like this when y'all was dating bro no she wasn't at all she was not like this bro she used to be normal is what happened then how do you go from making such innocuous Vlogs with your family to outright pandering to the lowest form of men on Twitter with no shame well without making any unreasonable assumptions here  we know from Emily that Pearl has been consistently fixated on finding a boyfriend in the past staying up late into the night and pouring over all the numbers and information she could possibly find in hopes of finally attaining a high value man of her liking honestly like sad because she was always trying trying to figure out what could she do to get a husband you I always told her that she did too much research she was always online like looking up relationship facts and stuff like that and and she would be up late like doing  it I'm like stop yeah just stop doing that like let's just naturally look for a man which again is fine everyone deserves to find love except I don't know how she expects to do it when this is how she advertises herself to the public now I'm not going to sit here pretend I know exactly why she pivoted so hard to Red Pill content we simply don't know the definitive reason as to why she's so susceptible to the man of fear and oh wait there is a reason and she said it herself oh okay or even girls they'll ask me like how can you  listen to this man and I have one one answer for you low selfesteem yeah that's real her answer to the question why do you listen to the sexist trash basically boils down to oh it's because I hate myself from a young age I haven't thought highly of myself I never thought that I deserved a lot to be honest um I never thought of myself as a queen um and I never thought of myself super highly I'm going to I'm going to just be honest here from a young age um I was what you call humbled okay most of my friends were  generally like more attractive than me I was never the hot friend most guys even the the average guys they would ask me about my friend first and if that didn't work out then then they would come crawling to me so yeah um I would say low self-esteem um that's the main one and yeah being humbled that's why I can listen to manosphere content this to me is an extremely telling moment if not a pretty sad one it reveals how Pearl truly sees herself and how all the hate and misogyny that the manosphere offers  actually confirms all the loathing Pearl has always reserved for herself deep down which I honestly can't help but pity when you view yourself with such a little regard as a person and accept that this must be just who you are your life becomes so one-dimensional and boring I mean who wants that for themselves this all may sound harsh but it is so hard to talk about Pearl's content without also seeing how deeply intertwined it is with her own self-image her entire Persona screams insecurity and Desperation to the point  where she has been widely coined a pikme Girl by just about everyone and you can't blame them because being a pikm is in the very nature of the character she portrays her Mission I want to give him permission but if I chose to go down the path of high value man I would know that it's a possibility and I don't think I would want to ruin an entire family over that if I was super in love and I had children children with the man and I was really really in love with him he was a good man overall I think I'd be lying if  I'd say that I couldn't get over it we should try to give men Grace I think that's part of relationships that's part of life like I think if a woman cheats she's trying to leave you if a man he's just like it's like a handshake I think we can all agree Pearl needs to chill the out and maybe she can do so with

men like seven children but the actual value is more like here you know what no that's a little too high I'm going to make it lower perceived actual Pearl uploads  multiple times a day to her Channel which means we get Clips like these on an incredibly frequent basis fat chicks have way more complications they have a harder time getting pregnant so if a traditional man wants children he can't pick a fat chick they're like okay if she's already chubby in her 20s then I have a lifetime of you know it is exhausting just how dedicated this woman is to embarrassing herself on such a public level I mean just look at these thumbnails and titles men men are not interested in modern women modern women  got schooled modern women will never understand this I am not Shing you when I say the words modern wom have appeared in over 600 of her titles over the past year alone so yeah you could say pearl has tapped into her own little niche which is pretending she knows everything while saying absolutely nothing you go from an 80% and people dispute these numbers left and right but you go from an 80% chance of a happy marriage with zero Partners to a 20% with five plus in one clip titled Pearl drops the mic  Pearl blames birth control for turning women into hoes before going on to say no fault divorce laws have allowed these evil women to ruin their families because social media has convinced them they deserve men they aren't hot enough for which might make some sense if you have the dating maturity of a 14-year-old boy otherwise this just sounds like a lazy mess of assumptions and painfully broad generalizations of women who get divorced birth control allowed hoes to be hoed the provider the the hoes don't pick the pro they picked  the chat then no fault of Boris allowed the host to leave then the government funded them leaving and then social media made girls that are sixes think they're nines and tens they break up their home because they think they can do better and they can't class dismiss I mean how is this meant to be convincing well it's not supposed to be convincing it's supposed to reinforce the stereotypes men have of whatever qualifies in their minds as modern women here is Pearl a woman saying the things that feed directly into into the biases  of someone displeased with women having access to things like birth control D Instagram or divorce here is a woman reassuring them that they're right without actually citing any direct evidence or examples as to why and the morons in the comments eat it the up this chick should win the presidential medal of freedom Pearl's dad is Chuck Norris we need smart people like her and Congress and Senate she's doing the work of the Lord she should Ro for congress you got to respect the way the Freedom loving Patriots want the  federal government to strip rights away from half the population why women shouldn't vote s yes okay I would like to tell you how I came to this conclusion I wanted to know why men were so angry about women when I started researching the stuff it was pretty easy to figure out why 90% of women have been on birth control one out of three women has had to one out of three women has an STD uh average body count is over five so that your average wife has slept with with over five people 95% of women are  not virgins on their wedding days I understand the complaint see the YouTube shorts format fits Pearl's arguments a lot more suitably than a fulllength fleshed Out video could the 60-second time limit lends itself to the inherent lack of nuance in her beliefs plus these get way more views too I don't know what it is but there's just something about these shorts that takes the algorithm by storm there's a way more potential to go viral here than anywhere else without any extra efforts you can get 22 million  people to watch this if my son came home from school one day and said to me look Mom I'll be honest with you I I think I'm gay I would take it on and what if your what if your what if your son came home and said I think I'm black well I mean obvious I would I mean obviously I'd have to sit him down i' be like so you don't think if you thought he was the opposite gender you might need to sit him down and tell him that he's that's what I said I mean I would listen to him yes if you got that one she didn't actually destroy Roy the woke  woman as the title insists she just changed the subject entirely multiple times too how is acknowledging a difference between race sexuality and gender owning anybody in this circumstance hey Mom I think I might be gay are you black that well that's not what I that's not the same thing oh okay so now you want to change your gender are you even listening to me wow children sure are dumb also of the way she sits there in silence as if she just made some epic clapback that left the room speech like no they're speechless  because what you just said was so mind-numbingly stupid they're in literal awe it's honestly pretty inspiring to think someone could be so confidently wrong on so many things I think we can see pretty plainly that when Pearl isn't pulling random out of her ass she's deliberately neglecting context to prove a point like for example here as you can see even Pierce Morgan still has the awareness to call Pearl out for ignoring the fact that many women back when it was illegal for them to vote were still  willing to take less opportunity because that's what they have been condition to accept and instead of rebutting this with anything specific or concrete her counter just does more to reinforce his point I found out that only 5% of women wanted the right to vote and I couldn't figure out like why would women not no it's true you at the time at the time because they've been conditioned by men to think that they shouldn't have a vote I mean that's what they say but you know I started reading their writings right  and what I found out was that the reason a lot of women advocated for it was because they believed it was the beginning of the breakdown of the family yeah obviously that's what their writing is going to say how does that mean they weren't being brainwashed it also goes back to responsibility men are 80 to 90% of the military they run all of the infrastructures that make Society run so I just think if we want an equal say in society then be equal go go apply to beond the oil RS go do go be a plumber  go be electrician go be on the front lines of the military and then we should have equal rights but until feminists are willing to do that I don't believe we should have the freedom without the respons but I don't think that I'm physically built that you might be P's position here seems to be that because men supposedly do all the heavy lifting in society then we deserve certain privileges like the right to vote since women are according to her not contributing the same as men they shouldn't get those same rights but a  policy like this wouldn't make much sense because not all men are doing such hard intense labor I'm not making this video from a top in oil rig so would I still get to vote in pearl land I guess this is something Pearl realized though because by the very next day she was clarifying that not all men should be allowed to vote either so there you go we have to Define what is the infrastructure farming manufacturing Transportation building the buildings Paving the roads now remember women do teaching we do nursing but if those jobs  went away the infrastructure of society would still run we would still have food we would still have water we would still have a military why should we have an equal sa maybe because you're still living in Society why should not participating in the specific Fields you mentioned disqualify someone from choosing how our communities are governed if everyone is affected by the actions of the government then everyone should ideally have a say I mean this shouldn't even be a debate plus Pearl overlooks the other countless jobs that	Center			Conservative	12

of view are so important because having these uncomfortable conversations with influential people is so important not just for the betterment of men but for  the entire world as a whole community so thank you PNG for stepping up as a Force for good in the world visit pgoodeveryday.com to learn more hello and welcome back to man enough I'm Justin baldoni here with the amazingly talented author Liz plank and Jamie Heath one of my best friends in the world and such a special cool human being a log is with us today hi everyone yes hello thank you so much for being with us today a little bit about you you are an Indian American writer and performance artist you are gender non-conforming and  trans feminine and have really used your life experience to advocate for all people and for a number of causes you famously have called for the degendering of the fashion and Beauty Industries uh you grew up in Texas to Indian and Malaysian immigrant parents and graduated from Stanford University no big deal no big deal that's easy right never heard of it and you are just a such a sought out public speaker you've spoken in so many different countries around the world and we are lucky to have you here with us  today as Justin mentioned you wrote a book called beyond the gender binary which we encourage all our listeners to go and buy Farm in public if I'm in public uh right uh which I'm saying with my French Canadian accent we really cannot wait to speak to you thank you so much for being with us on me enough thanks for having me so sweet so first thing first can you tell us the last time you didn't feel enough hmm I think I have a daily relationship with a sense of inadequacy [Music] I've written about this in the past but  when you are a non-binary person in this country in this time there's an imposter syndrome for being alive because people don't think that we should exist and so every day I have to remind myself they're wrong because I'm breathing they're wrong because I'm speaking and so I have to remind myself not only am I enough but the very system that has and weaponizes a criteria that would rather disappear me that's not a system that I'll ever evaluate me again um okay we can just wrap it right there I  feel like I should snap it I don't know what to do after that except I feel like that was also this is gonna happen the whole time I know by the way I'm preparing myself emotionally for it guilty as charged okay so beautifully articulated thank you for that what I wanted to ask personally is so part of what we're doing here is I have been brushing up against my own discomfort with masculinity for my whole life and I really didn't name it until I would say recently in the last decade so I wrote this book I'm going through  doing this podcast to have these conversations and to like address this invisible force that governs our very existence and for me whenever like something uncomfortable pops up I wanna I wanna name it and talk about it because if I don't talk about it then I know that thousands or millions of other people are not talking about it and I know we all feel it so I found myself getting nervous that I was going to say he instead of they which you did which I did and I corrected and then earlier I heard Liz  do it and what's funny is first of all I put I put Liz for everybody for you for everybody on a pedestal uh which I don't deserve to be she's Next Level and she educates me and and has been so kind and generous and I noticed I went like I feel better that I'm not the only one and and I read and I read your book and I understand gender pronouns and yet I still find myself sometimes feeling nervous because I don't want to mess up or or hurt you or say the wrong thing or feel like I'm I'm taking away from your  identity by calling you a he and so I'm just wondering do you feel people being nervous that they're going to say it wrong this is a 101 class for listeners because I just because I noticed I felt nervous and I didn't want to make you feel bad and so I apologize uh if I did I tried to correct it right away but for anybody who's listening who Maybe has never been around a gender non-conforming person because there's way too many uh people that haven't um what I'm just curious so that's kind of where I wanted to start sure I guess  I would say welcome to the awkward choreography of being a human yeah we're always going to mess up because we are indoctrinated into a world that teaches us ideology not compassion so it's not you speaking when you misgender me it's everyone that has spoken to you before and in my life what I always try to remind people as I was not born with gender literacy I was born hating myself and hunting myself and I had to learn too so other people are gonna have to learn and if that way I think trans people can  actually Teach the World transition as possible not just between genders between between paradigms it's so possible to learn and constantly be learning and in fact learning is the most delightful thing about being alive so what I say is when you mess up which is when you're alive because being alive is about messing up gloriously and I will fight for that ability to gloriously mess up because I don't believe that humans are statues or sculptures I believe that we're inconsistent and idiosyncratic and hairy  and fat and unfurling and that's what's joyous about being alive what we do then is say I'm sorry I'm learning it won't happen again and then if it happens again I'm sorry I'm gonna try even harder and that's what love is for me trying harder for each other um thank you um because it's just like mic drop every time I appreciate how gracious you are with this I don't want to make a false equivalence but being black I have experienced um trying to find a way to navigate through it all um and some of us who are oppressed  have more capacity to deal with the than another does it make us better it means that for whatever reason we're able and we need people that are able to do that so that those can learn right who otherwise wouldn't I'm sorry I'm taking a long time getting out because I'm also getting emotional because I have I personally through my life who Champions people I don't get it all and I'm feeling bad that I don't get it because you're amazing and I'm listening to you speak and I'm like why do I not fight for them  why do I have such passion for other things but this one I have a disconnect with um so what do I need to unlearn what do I how can I help other and I particularly talk about men help them unlearn hmm let's get into it I'm non-binary which means it's not just that I'm challenging the binary between male female man woman but between us and Them and in your statement you said why don't I help them as if this struggle is not your struggle too the reason you don't fight for me is because you're not  fighting for yourself fully and any movement that's trying to emancipate men from the shackles of heteropatriarchy or emancipate women from traditional gender ideology has to have trans and non-binary people at the Forefront because we are actually the most honest we're tracing the root where do these ideas of manhood and Womanhood come from they come from a binary structure and so that's why people like me who are visibly gender non-conforming who are both feminine and masculine and none of the above we experience the brunt of all  of these Collective fantasies that were created that are killing other people that are also killing us it just looks different and so one of the things that I try to do in my work is say don't show up for me because you want to protect me or you want to help me I don't need your help I have an unshakable and irrevocable sense of who I am because I am Divine I come from people who were exterminated and targeted by colonists because the gender binary and we can get into this was superimposed on black  people indigenous people and people of color by European colonists and the reason that they targeted us is because they knew our power right so the reason that there's so much animus against me is because of my power I don't need to be legitimized or I don't have anything to prove what I want us to rephrase the conversation is are you ready to heal and I don't think the majority of people are ready to heal and that's why they repress us as trans and gender variant people because they've done this violence to themselves first  they've repressed their own femininity they've repressed their own gender non-conformity they've repressed their own ambivalence they've repressed their own creativity and so when they see us have the audacity to live a life without compromise where we say there are no trade-offs where we say we actually get to carve in the marrow of this Earth and create our own goddamn Beauty instead of saying thank you for teaching me another way to live they try to disappear us because they did that to themselves  first so I guess I would rephrase your your question to be can you help me get free not can you help me help you one of the things that we don't speak enough about is that we don't know how to see each other for each other we see each other for what we think one another should be so we're constantly when you say pedestal I think that's dehumanizing because we're at a table and that's what it means to be alive it's to look at each other horizontally not need to put each other on pedestals and that we inherit  that of saying that the only way that people have value is if they're Saints but I actually believe that people have value because they're the opposite of being a saint and I actually believe that there's a dignity just to being not to doing so if we actually believe that people have dignity for being not doing there's a kind of mercy and a kind of love that I have for everyone because we've only been conditioned into feeling like we can be loved if we emulate some standards that were created by someone  else so people have not experienced My Kind of Love before because what I'm actually telling men is you don't have to be masculine you don't have to be strong you don't have to be all-knowing what I'm actually telling men is you're allowed to be vulnerable you're allowed to be human and people don't know how to receive that love and I think that's the pair paradigm shift I really want to move away from is that the fear and the danger makes it so that people aren't ready to receive love people have been  taught to fear the very things have the potential to set them free this is nothing to do with trans and non-binary people it's never been about us it's not about what we look like it's about what they feel like and they don't know how to feel love like we can give and that's why marginalized communities are persecuted it's not because of what we look like what we're saying our identities our pronouns our nomenclatures our language our scholarship it's because of the presence of love that people feel like they can't  actually inherit on this Earth and so the reason there's so much violence that men are siphoning on to us is because they don't love themselves and so they see our self-love right they see I have men come up to me in New York City and say I used to wear my mom's dresses when I was younger and then I'll say what happened and they can't even articulate that and that's where our starting ground is you don't even have the language to articulate a wound so you don't even know that you're hurting and that you're bleeding and  what we as Transcendent in our converting people said is that there's a wound here and I'm going to commit my life to actually realigning my spiritual core such that I never have to compromise myself for other people's love and I'm going to prioritize and choose me in a world that makes me have to Contour myself into someone else's fiction and and so what I tell men is this is not about accepting transgender and conforming people this is about accepting yourself and if you do that work first everything  I'm going to say is makes sense but if you don't do that work everything that I say is going to be inherited as an attack from a zero-sum ideology that makes you think that if other people thrive you must somehow lose something that's what's happening with misogyny in this country right now I really try to bring history into the conversation because one of the things that is really important to name is people like me are honestly delegitimized and discredited by every institution of media in this country  because this kind of knowledge they'd rather put us on a drag show and laugh at us than actually listen to us right we're more acceptable when we're entertaining you not when we're educating you so I actually want to remind people that I'm a scholar and I have certifications in everything that I study so in the early 20th century when women were making the claim for the right to vote what did men do they created postcards that actually had women dressed up as men and men dressed up as women and they said if women get  the right to vote we're going to be feminized and we're gonna lose power and it's going to be women who are making us do what we've done to women take care of the kids and stay at home women were basically just saying we want the right to vote and Men heard that as I'm losing power and then here we are a hundred years later trans and gender non-conforming people are saying hey everyone I want to be able to exist I want to be able to walk outside without being spat on I want to be able to live and not fear  dying I want to be able to wear what I'm wearing and not be called Brave I want to be able to actually have people regard my Humanity not some one-dimensional Trope that they're getting from these racist and transphobic algorithms and people are saying that's a threat darling the threat is a system that has made you mistake your latent disassociation as a personality that's the threat I mean are we running a cult because like I will do whatever you want um we'll go ahead also I just want to say thank you for pointing that out to  me and I am so sorry if that was dehumanizing in any way to you I would never yeah thank you for making me aware of that of course you are listening to the man enough podcast we will be right back I believe that expectations based on gender which so many of us have heard since we were children are at the root of so many of society's illnesses today now I want to change that for my children's generation and their children's generation and the way to do that is with uncomfortable conversations my personal Journey started with me  looking in the mirror first and then talking with my friends friends like Jamie and Liz now over the years we've had a lot of uncomfortable conversations many of which I look back on now and cringe but that means that I'm a better person today because of the conversations I had yesterday because I was willing to sit in that discomfort and listen I want to keep having those conversations and becoming a better human and then share those conversations with the world through the man enough podcasts our partner PNG the maker of  Brands like tide Swiffer Mr Clean Pantene and Brawn shares that mission of creating a more equal World a more just and Equitable world where boys and girls men and women can all have equal access and opportunity to learn grow succeed and Thrive I am so grateful for their partnership in bringing these conversations to light together we can create a better world all we got to do is stay in the room visit pgoodeveryday.com to learn more about how PNG aims to make it easier to create a better tomorrow  [Music] all right welcome back to the man enough podcast I want to go to a there's something in your book you said you were talking about clothing and just how backwards all of this is and you had mentioned that men actually invented high heels and I see you wearing I don't know if those are platforms but I was very curious uh how that happened but then also like if you know how it changed yeah it's such a fun story so heels actually emerged in the 10th Century in Persia and heels are invented because of  stirrups like riding a horse the heel makes sense to actually be in the Stirrup to get a more secure footing and then heels enter Europe in the 17th century with male aristocracy so in the 17 18th century in France red heels are the sign of like extreme masculinity and like Bourgeois masculinity and in fact women get mocked for wearing heels in the 17th century because it's associated with male aristocracy so women begin to actually wear articles of clothing that are associated with men and are getting  ridiculed sounds about right when we think about history and what happens is in the late 18th and early 19th century clothing becomes to be extremely gendered in this binary way so things that we now associate with femininity like makeup jewelry adornment wigs leggings heels that only becomes gender disc feminine in the late 18th and early 19th century as part of a political project of making up the gender binary so I'd like to explain that for people here's the truth men and women actually 99.9 of our genes are the same everyone  spoiler alert and actually the predominant idea in Europe prior to the enlightenment was that there was one sex and this binary sex model actually only emerges in the late 18th and 19th century how do you prove a new formulation fashion becomes politicized fashion becomes how you prove that there's an inherent distinction why did they feel the need to say that this inherent distinction between men and women after the French Revolution you have this idea of inalienable rights so you have French women saying hey so if  you're saying inaliable rights like that means women get rights right and then men say about that um actually no about that you are biologically different and inferior so you have to stay at home so how do you justify patriarchy you say naturally males and females are different and females natural orientation is to only be mothers at home and male's natural orientations to be leaders in the political sphere and so fashion becomes politicized where women get beaten for trying to wear pants so if you read  early feminist writing in the 19th century the dress reform Society the rational dress Society the dress Reform movement they're saying we want the right to wear pants and that's not just about an article of clothing it's about being able to exist in the public because at this time public women were sex workers people couldn't imagine women existing in the public without men right so when I'm talking about degender fashion people like this new Millennial internet fad I'm like oh my gosh the real fad is gendering fashion to begin  with all the podcasts we've done well you know when the true sign of learning is when you just you it takes a minute to process like okay wait I gotta I gotta take that in that was deep I'm I'm wondering for those that are not sure how they morally feel about the whole this this discussion religiously feel about this discussion that are good people that are either misinformed shallow whatever we may call them but I still need them to see and treat the world fair and and not be ridiculed so what I hear you say  I hear like stages me and Liz talk about this stuff about you know we're not going to get from here to here overnight so there's got to be something which I think you graciously do um I guess where I'm leaning is for those of us who are you know it's it's just a lot to take in um it shouldn't be but it is there's got to be a way that we are changing things so that you're not living in fear I don't want to live in fear I don't want you to live in fear regardless if I support or not and I don't mean me personally I say hi  for on behalf of many um you know so how do you think we get through this because I have to know as a black person I know I don't care if you see me as Eco or not I'm done with that right but I deserve the same rights that you have right right right so there's two discussions there I really resonate with what you're saying because the focus has been on comprehension not compassion so people will say I don't understand why do you need to understand me in order to say that I I shouldn't be experiencing violence like that that  equation we need to really interrogate like what lack of empathy is there in that statement to be like I just don't get it what I don't get it becomes a shield for saying I'm okay with you being exposed to violence so we need to name that bluff out loud it's never been about comprehension it's been about compassion because here's the thing you suddenly have the time to learn the things that you prioritize but when it comes to gender non-conforming people it's I don't really have the time that takes too much time you don't have the  compassion let's be honest about it it's like when people get upset they say there's so many new words that are being created around gender and sexuality why weren't you taking a more public stance on the Oxford comma you didn't care about grammar then you only care grammar when it comes about they them pronouns that's actually your Shield that you're not actually naming I'm uncomfortable with seeding ground that's what this is about I'm uncomfortable because I feel like I have a monopoly and culture and  if anyone else who looks different me or thinks different than me belongs then it's at zero sum thinking that means I must go but what I want to offer the world is that there's enough space for all of us you're operating in a fishbowl but this is a world and this is a universe and in fact in my universe when you step into your power that just encourages me to step in mind and that's not a conflict so the ways that trans rights gets positioned is if it's seen as an antagonistic Force against tradition against culture that mentality  he break out of it it actually transwrites accelerate freedom for all people that's right and trans rights fundamentally actually are going to help men because men are going to actually be able to develop their own understandings of what manhood means to them oh uh does the the trans and gender non-conforming movement uh help men sure specifically yeah you know a lot of non-binary people get a bad rap because people think that we're just the killjoys coming in being like you're not allowed to be a man or a woman or like  if you're a man or woman then you're complicit in my oppression that's not true what we're saying is that man and woman are two of potentially infinite and that man and woman are like two stars in the sky and that they don't actually require diminishing one another's shine man doesn't have to mean not woman woman doesn't have to be not man masculine doesn't have to mean not feminine feminine doesn't have to mean not masculine and so we're saying that there's potentially as many ways to be a man as there are men there's as many  ways to be a woman as there are women and you get to tell me what man and woman means to you so actually moving beyond the gender binary is not about erasing your ability to be a man or woman it's about asking you who are you and that's what's going to help men is because we've created such a rigid and stringent straight jacket of what it means to be a man that is so malnourished a historical toxic and dangerous for all parties involved and what I'm actually trying to say is you don't have to be that you get to be your  own man and that manhood doesn't invalidate anyone else's manhood just tell me it's a conversation it's a story it's Humanity that's where category culture kills us we only know each other through these simple words that we're all saying but we don't even know what they mean anymore and I want us to actually be honest many of us don't know who we are outside of what we've been told we should be trans people we know who we are and that's where we're being hunted because we literally chose authenticity and the  face of adversity what a rational decision in my life hey everyone I'm gonna walk outside with a beard and a dress today and people think that we just like we're up to like some malicious intent darling I have to deal with people throwing trash at me right for existing in public I have to deal with extreme scrutiny of my life everywhere I go why am I doing this I'm doing this because I know the power of authenticity and that's what trans people teach men CIS men is there's nothing more powerful than  stepping into your truth and that's what the healing is going to take in this world is if we stop living someone else's fantasy of who we should be and we actually get intimate with who we who we actually are so much so much of so much of what you say and I told you this before in the way that you wrote your book and even the language that you use resonates with me as a straight white CIS male um and that's why I was so interesting you know even like coming up against my own biases because it's like  you know how could your experience in mind be so similar and yet strangely they are because it's the same system it's the same system of Oppression that makes us feel that way and that's why I like reading your book if anything like I just it just shows and I what you're saying is so valuable and so important because it's true like what your your freedom your ability to to believe that you are enough your ability to walk around the street in your own authenticity sets me free hmm because I'm struggling with my own  version of that just because you don't see me wearing a dress I still feel walking out into the world my own version of what it is that you're feeling and I think that that's what so many and again people but this is really you know I wrote my book directed to men wanting everyone to feel enough and free at the end of the day because that that was when I was digging into my version of this work that's all I could come up with was I want to undefine masculinity to make room for anybody who sees themselves beautiful that's it yeah  that's the purpose of my book because I feel like it's all of the shoulds and those things that have caused me pain and suffering but the way you are putting it and like the idea of like comprehension versus compassion it just was like that's it like I shouldn't have to understand you to love you and to want your safety that's it regardless like you could be a you could be a uh a right-wing person or a left-wing person on the extreme side and at the end of the day it doesn't matter what you believe so long as that  you want this person to be loved and safe and be free existing in the world in their beauty and majesty and glory and not have to worry about their like safety just like I want the same thing for you as a black man I don't want you to have to get worried about getting shot in the back when you get pulled over for a tail light I don't want that for you but yet that's the problem we feel like we have to understand it in order to love it but that's so backwards so I just want to say thank you so much  for risking all that you're risking for yourself and all of us for vulnerabilities sake because I as I I am grateful and I feel it's so strange I feel what you're saying in some ways I feel Freer sitting with you I feel free of sitting with you it's not gonna speak you better talk your truth it's not just one direction yeah it's it's it's what I fundamentally believe is that when we Channel our purpose on this Earth that creates the lighthouse that everyone has been searching for for me it's not about I want everyone to  identify as non-binary no you can end up wherever yeah I just want you to be honest with me about your journey and that Honesty makes me want to live because we have to play pretend in this world all the time hey everyone I love my nine to five job like hey everyone I'm doing great I'm amazing I'm awesome and that's why I bring it back to mental health every time I have this conversation that amount of pressure of trying to play pretend that you know everything that you're like a magically PC it's exhausting and the moments where  you're gonna just like take off your shoes and build home with each other and just be like hey everyone we're vibing and we're figuring it out like that makes me want to live and that's what I feel I want so badly going forward is trans people have been so severely pigeonholed by Western culture we are sensationalized and spectacularized as a freak Show for other people to work through their own self-hatred through and what that is actually not just to harming and oppressing us it is harming and oppressing you because it restricts  options in your own life and what I want you to understand is that we live in possible lives so I'm not supposed to be here you're not supposed to be here you're not supposed to have the Consciousness that you have now you're not supposed to have written the book that you're supposed to write you're not supposed to be able to reach the people that you are reaching but you did and so what that for me suggests is that it's not that impossible things aren't going to happen it's that when we get the right people in the right room we  can make them happen and then in fact the Coalition that needs to happen to end misogyny is the Coalition of all genders and that's what's been wrong about so much the theorizing about gender in the past is people think that you can just sort of like have one camp and undo the gender system when in fact what I'm trying to say is all of us are harmed by this gender system that harm looks different and we can speak about those differences but at the end of the day overhauling this gender binary system  isn't just gonna help me it's gonna help everyone and can we touch on that because you know this Coalition some of the the and and you speak about this some of the the people have been the most hateful and discriminating against you have been from women who call themselves feminists right that this movement um believes that in order to understand sexism you have to to to experience your life as a woman so how do you feel like your life and and your this dialogue that you're having threatens women too  you know I return it back to trauma always is that people feel scarcity they feel like if if we're holding someone else's narrative then my narrative is not going to be heard and they feel like unless it's their particular experience that's absolutely being named then they're being erased but there's a difference between entitlement and Erasure entitlement is being able to say my narrative is the only narrative and what I'm actually trying to say is your narrative is valid but so is mine and it is possible for all of these  things to be true multiplicity of Truth is healing that patriarchy takes many nasty manifestations and it doesn't discredit or delegitimize what it looks like on a particular experience to name the whole swath of those experiences and then well people will say well right now we're focusing on one issue we'll get to the other where has that gotten us historically this incremental pathway right and who's we who decides that exactly and so what I'm actually trying to say is I want to create a world where  everyone gets to choose their own gender where everyone gets to look like whatever they want to look like without fearing violence how is that derailing that's literally saying hey everyone I want freedom and people say no no no but I really want to return it back to trauma because this is not a rational thing right like a lot of people try to have this conversation trying to make it about logic it's never been about logic it's been about trauma and that's why I think that I I always bring up the fact  that I'm a poet is because I'm concerned with a human condition and humans the reason I love them is because we're irrational not because we are making decisions about things that are going to help us in the future we're self-sabotaging and that's what I love about being humans is that we mess up like we began with and we're idiosyncratic and we're ridiculous and we make decisions that are just so silly and one of the things that's so tragic about Humanity is that we keep on mistaking the prison  as another home we keep on saying this is freedom and it's just another leash and what we don't recognize is that true freedom is gonna be uncomfortable because when you're so conditioned into this Perpetual status of our unfreedom that calcifies and so people think that what is natural and what is reality is actually a prison and what I'm actually trying to say is the only gender rule is that there are no rules and that actually man and woman only mean what you need them to mean for you and people  hear that as a threat and not an invitation because of trauma because they're afraid of possibility because they've been taught that the only way that they can get love and receive love and be is by being someone else's fantasy of who they should be but in my world that I'm creating and in fact in the world that we have right now to this table what I'm going to say is love means I will never understand you but I'm going to keep on coming back love means I will listen to you tell the same story over and over again because the  way that you tell it is different love means I love you because you're are different love means I love you even if I don't understand you I'm going to keep on trying and we're going to struggle together to make it work and that's why the antidote to trauma is compassion a lot of people will project trans people as these hyper political correct people entering the chat policing people's discourse you want to talk about police let's talk about how from 1840s until 1970s and later in this country it was a criminal offense for me  to exist in public from cross-dressing legislation that through people like me in prison and you have the audacity to say that we're new it's not that we're new it's that you've naturalized our disappearance and now we're in these public spaces that we weren't allowed to be in for decades and we're actually showing you what love looks like in public and people aren't ready to receive it so what I say to these feminists who are not feminists is are you fighting for Freedom are you fighting for privilege  because privilege is the ability to monopolize privilege is the ability to do what was done to you to other people that the way that we heal pain is not by transmitting it it's by transforming it and so what I'm saying is your pain is valid but your use of that pain your weaponization of that pain to harm other people that's not valid let's interrupt the cycle of trauma and to interrupt the cycle of trauma we have to actually say that hurt people hurt people and we're constantly trying to do what has been  done to us to other people that is what it means to be trans is to inherit the byproduct of sexism that CIS women experience from CIS men they take it out on us it's a game of an elaborate strategy of hot potato and I say what's to say that there are no potatoes and let's get a table and just start over you know I'm not interested in having conversations around who is the most depressed I'm not interested in ranking oppression I'm not interested in those metrics of trying to say your experience is not as great as  mine what I'm interested in saying is when you understand trauma not being seen feels like a deepest pain that there ever was and so what I'm trying to say is that all pain is valid and the way that we transform through that pain is actually being kind generous and interdependent and connecting through that pain which you talk about so much it's it's again you're just I'm so grateful that you're here um yeah it's something I wasn't aware of first of all um so I can imagine I can imagine that pain of like going  through everything that you've already gone through just fighting to be yourself and to be seen to be loved for who you are and your choices and how you want to live your life and then also then having women attack you for that that's that's a lot I I am I have to believe and this might not be the right thing to say but there are certain people in my life who I've met who at the intersection of Oppression seem to have this superhuman ability to see the world in a way that I just I never could because I haven't had it and  I'm very blessed that I have that with Jamie's one of my best friends he sees because of his oppression because of the pain he's been through things that I am not able to see I wish I could see them but it would require me being in his body and sitting here next to you I feel like you have a superpower that you shouldn't have to have you shouldn't have to have gone through everything that you've gone through shouldn't have had to attempt to take your life at such a young age because of

A222	https://youtu.be/jv1UI1j9-nM?si=5SjWB7hwWihYhIV6	well howdy there internet people it's Bo again so today we are going to talk about another way to look at the Johnson Trump dynamic because there's still questions coming in about it and this isn't exactly the perfect metaphor but I think it might help first let's run through what occurred recent developments so Johnson the Speaker of the House pushed through that package that Aid package and in doing so he sidelined the Twitter faction that's what we call him on the channel the Twitter faction  what's another way to describe them Trump's biggest supporters in the House of Representatives his most vocal supporters got sidelined and Johnson did this after going down there and talking to Trump and let's be clear it's not like Trump was super in favor of Aid to Ukraine to begin with Trump's never in favor of anything that hurts Russia and Johnson did that after refusing to get rid of fisa which Trump ordered over Twitter what did Trump say after all of this happened what is Trump's normal move  when somebody disobeys him he comes out after him right saying very very mean things about him calling him a rhino because they were failing to obey him because he's the one that should be respected and saluted but what did he say well look we have a majority of one okay it's not like he can go and do whatever he wants to do I think he's a very good person that's a departure right that's a deviation from the norm it seems like Trump just can't really get a handle on him somebody would be forgiven for thinking  that Johnson outplayed Trump in a pretty public fashion but you don't have a lot of outcry from the House of Representatives as a whole just certain elements mostly that faction that got sidelined it seems like a strange Dynamic but it's not you have to go go back to 2016 remember most Republicans up in Congress they don't actually like Trump think about what they say about him in private when it leaks out have you ever heard something good leak out they don't like him they never liked him even people who offer support  for him today back in 2016 they did not have kind words for the man they didn't see him coming back then but as thick as they were they paid attention they watched him and they realized that Trump was all about his ego if you fed his ego even just words that fed his ego the words were something that boosted his pride and you were in and they watched how Trump took those people who had vacant Expressions maybe the lights weren't on upstairs and he had them eating out of his hand and all they had to do to tap  into that was just feed his ego they're politicians that's a ready voting base so they did it that doesn't mean they liked him it just means they went along with him and in the process they went along with his worst instincts this isn't a defense of them to be clear then 2020 started to roll around they were not going to be caught unaware it wasn't like 2016 they knew that for whatever reason he had that captive audience so they played into it they played into it they put up with the cles of fake  news they put up with all of his behavior and they just tried to stay on his good side because that Maga era was tiptoeing nearer it was good for them they didn't really have to do much all they had to do was stay in his good graces and they would be able to use that uh that base they just had to listen to teacher obey and they'd get reelected they'd get his support they'd be connected to a leader who was alltime adored and just in true true Trump fashion everything was transactional so yeah they had to take  certain duties on board but those people in Congress they looked at Trump's family and they saw them making out just tons of money if you were in Trump's Circle the future was littered with prizes all he had to do was stay in his good graces and he never failed to emphasize that well you wouldn't get anything without him right you had to stay in his good graces or he would come out and trash you on Twitter something he's not doing to Johnson so they obeyed they listened they got prepared for the coup of the century the  murkiest scam not really the greatest planning and it failed what happened to scar at the end the Hyena's turned on him I'm not saying that this is the beginning of the Hyena's turning on Trump but it definitely appears that at least one of the hyenas is smarter than him way smarter and is positioning himself to to be uh well to be the leader if Trump was to take a fall it's important to remember that most Republican Congress people do not actually like him they're not going to be upset not most of  them they supported him because it was good for them and those who recognized what he was and supported him anyway I mean to me that's kind of even worse again this isn't a defense it's an explanation of of what they did it was politics and it set the scene for a lot of bad things but don't confuse that political expediency for actual loyalty it's not there they don't actually support him not most of them you don't have outcry not widespread about what Johnson did repeatedly he repeatedly defied or undermined  Trump and Trump realistically seems powerless to do anything about it in fact when you think about it one of his biggest supporters is leading the charge to oust Johnson meanwhile Trump's out there making excuses for him I think he's a very good man I think he's trying very hard you have two real choices one is to believe that Trump at his age has suddenly changed his behavior the behavior we've seen for a very very long time and maybe Trump's trying to play the long game or something like that  or Trump realizes that maybe his star is fading you don't have to believe that Johnson is a genius you don't have to believe believe that he is McConnell in the making but if you are a democratic strategist don't underestimate him don't do what you did with Trump where he's not nobody would really follow him it didn't work out well last time either Johnson got incredibly lucky repeatedly and Trump has just become incredibly understanding or Johnson outplayed him and for whatever reason Trump doesn't think he can do  anything about it that to me if I was a democratic strategist might be the more concerning part you know the big worry about Trump wasn't that he would actually be successful when it comes to something like the sixth the worry is that his rhetoric would pave the way for somebody who was a bit more polished a bit more subtle but had the exact same goals don't underestimate this man maybe things change maybe the political winds shift again and Trump gets a chance to get even or maybe Trump doesn't even realize that he that he got  bested right now he may not even realize it because the Trump of today is not the Trump of 2016 I think that's becoming more and more clear the more we hear about his behavior in court but if he does realize it sure maybe Johnson star starts to fade but either way the Democratic party cannot underestimate this man anyway it's just a thought y'all have a good day 	Liberal			Conservative	17
A230	https://youtu.be/K6GKR_ZN2N4?si=iUHkQiyo8Z9q-u5f	so right now you're under arrest for theft for what for a theft I just explain you have been resisting the whole time no I didn't you didn't even grab me that is hurting and like I said I'm pregnant stop come here here stop shoplifting is one of the most common minor crimes and while most stores have been a victim of this offense not everyone is clever enough to get away with it even worse sometimes shoplifters get caught and make their situation a million times worse by having an entitled attitude towards the  cops the good news is that these shoplifters receive the perfect Karma and watching them being humbled by the cops is incredibly satisfying without further Ado make sure you've got your popcorn ready so we can dive into the worst cases of entitled Target shoplifters getting away with shoplifting once would be an accomplishment already but we can't see why anyone would be stupid enough to try their luck more than once especially at the same store unfortunately for this one regular Target shoplifter today she  would run into some trouble buckle up get comfy and let's see what happens today you were seeing for a while possible concealing items to include clothing jewelry some other items checkout and they wanted me to get you identify so that they can for other incidents and they wanted to know if you concealed any others would you be willing to to open up your Pur so I can see you didn't conceal anything so there's items with Target tags on those I came in here with that what's that I came in here with  that and just you our body cams on so you're being recorded she has what looks like a underwear or some sort of like an underwear jewelry and like a pair of shoes I don't have no shoes shoes about the jewelry jewelry so every single one of those things has tags on them and when they go back that's a lot of jewelry this woman is caught red-handed by the police with a bag full of her Loot and as it turns out this would be her ninth time stealing from this target this time she loaded up on all kinds of  products and pricey jewelry the nerve of this woman is quite unbelievable but it gets even worse from here on out I'm not going to go to go please so right now you're under arrest for for what for a fact I just stop get off me stop no get off stop no please get off me off absolutely not have he broke my watch oh my gosh please get off me hey put your hands behind your back you're under arrest get off for what you're under arrest for theft just like I told you okay let me get up let me get up no lay down down  put your hands behind your back can I get up pleas hands behind your back can I get up please hey stop your hands resting hey let me get up can I please get up no why Len can I please get up listen the more you resist the more things I do that's going to hurt stop stop resisting as soon as you stop resisting we can get you in handcuffs God come bring back I'm not trying to go to not trying to go to ja I you just ch it today the shocked look on the woman's face when she gets told she's under arrest while literally holding a handful  of stolen goods is Priceless and we're not sure how she thought she'd ever try and outrun the cops even with her dramatic escape attempt the funny thing is she didn't even make it to the other end of the parking lot and her hilarious run from the cops was caught perfectly on the body cameras so I'm not trying to go to jail I'm sorry I'm not trying to go to jail go you should have thought about that before you run I'm reasonable I could have sided you and released you you started this I'm so sorry now you're  under arrest for obstruction as well trying to run so sorry take a step to your left separate your feet please I don't want you to kick my partner if you do you're going to get an assault on officer charge too I'm not going to kick please pleas let me go please all right let's walk to the police car I'm apologize I'm S I think the throwing of the Pepsi on me is not necessary no I'm so sorry I really do apologize like can you please let me go no I just got out of jail oh my God suddenly now that the woman is  caught she starts being super apologetic but it's a little too late now the woman then shares some interesting information this is actually not going to be her first time seeing the inside of a jail in fact it's a surprise that her recent unpleasant encounter didn't scare her straight so what I'm going to do is first we're going to grab your index fingers just to make sure you provide us a real name okay jail what were you in jail for before cuz I had two old warant that I just squashed and what were those for um  a duy and um a trespassing Motel see okay all right so this going to be the back of my hand I'm going to P you down make sure you have any weapons on you before I do that can you tell me if you have any sharp dangerous P hazer needles Bazookas guns okay back of my hand the cops clearly can't trust a word this woman said so they did an extra check to confirm her identity thankfully the body search goes down without too much drama unless you count the woman hyperventilating and crying in the background her pleas are falling on deaf  ears though and she's about to learn that shop lifting and running from the cops have some serious consequences so why come in here to steal I don't have the money for it I don't know I don't have the money for it do you have a job no can you get a job yes okay why don't you do that instead of coming in a Target trying to steal why don't you come in to Target and ask for work I'm I know it's not always that easy but sometimes it is all these businesses around here are trying to recover from Co so everybody's got a hiring sign  up do you have a drug problem you're may be paying for with these drugs or with these with these stolen items yes okay what's the going right now for like underwear and jewelry and stuff or was that for your own personal use the underwear was my own personal use and then what are you getting for jewelry these days the jewelry I was going to sell it to somebody to for them to buy it for my drug habits how many Blues are you getting for like a piece of jewelry like one just one yeah where you getting  that at from somebody that I know the cop at this point was being very understanding after the woman admits to her struggle with drugs the reason behind her Reckless Behavior becomes clear it also seems like the person who's buying the stolen Target merchandise from her isn't giving her very good compensation for her illegal Ventures either she's probably starting to regret her actions right about now and you're like I don't want to go back to jail and I say yeah you you are under arrest I can always arrest you and then  you and I have this conversation and then I say hey I'm going to let you go since you were Cooperative in this s but you showed you weren't going to be cooperative when you ran and then you threw a soda at me sorry I apologize now I have I literally washed my uniform last night now I have soda all over I'm so sorry I'm not trying to go to jail please you guys can trespass me fre here I want to come back here I'm like well so you're getting that too your trespass from Target for life can never come back  okay they also have eight other cases that I'm going to look at the footage of so far what they said was the total that you have stolen from this store is between 1,500 $2,000 so if that's the case then we're looking at possible felony charges for organized retail theft depending on how the prosecutor wants to handle it or each one of those days is a separate theft charge okay go through her bag and see what other stuff is it seems like having that full bottle of soda thrown at him was the last straw for the cop as  they were willing to work with the woman before she turned it into a sticky situation literally the total value of what she stole was a pretty big number and we're pretty sure she wasn't expecting to be possibly charged with a felony can somebody pull video to show that whole incident plus us taking her down y I'll be able to have all that please I'm not trying to ja okay okay slide your foot in there for me okay I got to talk to my partner my sergeant all the way over okay then give me a second I'll here lean  back I'm going to make sure I got some AC blowing back here okay all in all the cops were being pretty decent to and even made sure she had the luxury of cool air but very soon she'd have to take responsibility for her crimes as they say no good deed goes unpunished and this woman learned that neither does shoplifting if there's one lesson here it's this don't run from the cops after you've been called shoplifting the shoplifting woman was charged with assault shoplifting possession of stolen property and drug possession as well as  resisting arrest she also received a permanent ban from all Target stores people normally try to act as inconspicuous as possible when attempting a crime like shoplifting from Target but these next two women clearly didn't get the memo when the cops arrived on the scene these two were in the parking lot unloading their full cart of stolen goods into their car right in broad daylight could you be any more stupid you guys just took from Target no take yeah they just called you just stole from them no  no 91 Cy 28 we have returns anybody got an ID on them no okay well they just said you took over a th000 bucks worth of stuff from them so you got an ID no stop I didn't do push me out of way I push out the way I'm not doing pregnant okay as soon as the cops try to assess the situation the pregnant woman tries to physically bar the cop from opening her door and this sets off the dramatic and heated debate that followed news flash you can't use being pregnant as an excuse to get out of being arrested and the cops  Sal to prosecut her to the full extent of the law and if the charges stick it would be totally justified I did not push you I push the door and you hurt in my arm I'm not resisting you have been resisting the whole time no I didn't you didn't even grab me that is hurt and like I said I'm pregnant all right stop committing Time Crimes while you're pregnant let me go you don't know what I did I didn't you're not being let go all right I don't have anybody inside just stop don't even ask okay can you let be  on the way out can you please let me go I'm not resisting I'm pregnant you already did resist once we're not I push the door when being impossible to deal with giving the cops a hard time and standing in the way of them doing their job you cannot expect gentle treatment but the claims from the pregnant woman that the cops pushed or hurt her are totally baseless if anything she was hurting herself with all that struggling and resisting exactly and I'm pregnant can you please fix them now let me go  I'm not doing I said I'm pregnant can you please fix the cff now I'm pregnant this hurting me they loading I'm moving come from that the dramatic Shenanigans of the pregnant lady are quickly getting old and we're not sure how she doesn't realize by now that she's only making the situation so much worse she should take a few tips from her friend let me go I can't go nowhere going to our station that's fine do I got a choice at this point you absolutely you do not cuz you made your own choice prior to that even being  strapped into the back of the police car the Karen and yes she definitely earned this title continues being obnoxious and even swears at the cops people like this deserve to get a whole buttload of Karma and we'd expect that the consequences this woman will now face will straighten her out it's hard to be that hopeful though I appreciate you cooperating um unlike your I'm not going to call your friend just your acquaintance I'm not sure how well you know her but obviously you can see that she's causing problems  she's she's already in the squad sitting that's why you're out here talking to us right now because we don't see the need to Dore you on squad car problem well I hav't L and I have no reason to right off the bat the pregnant lady's friend is a a whole lot more cooperative and the interaction she has with the cops is vastly different this proves that these entitled criminals have only themselves to blame when the cops start getting rough with them you can't expect to commit a crime and then still have your  own way when law enforcement shows up so what where did this stuff come from to the best of your knowledge well we just get a lot of this stuff out of her mom's house like I she said she's moving so her mom stay not too far from here and we just like load the stuff out um there's a TV in the back where' that come from from where from Target yes okay the woman is able to shed a bit more light on the specifics of the case apart from the TV they'd already loaded the woman claimed that nothing in the trunk was  stolen do you think this was actually their stuff or was this just another cash of stolen goods from another store hey this is your car you said just so you know you're missing two lug notes on one there and one there so be careful I I don't want to see your wheel off or anything like that you know you seem like a nice person so I don't want you get hurt or anything this car was in our town last night we had a f we got the cops showed their caring and compassionate side here the side which most of these entitled and rude  criminals never see here the cops prove that most of them actually do care about the well-being of average citizens and if you just comply with them while they're doing their jobs you'll very rarely have any problems I tell you what I'm the boss so I I'm not going to be the one that's going to be handling these the whole case I'm not going to be you know interviewing you guys again um so we're going to have another officer eventually going to come in and talk to you and and uh I appreciate how how straight forward  straight upfront NIS you been and calm we appreciate that the cop just explained what most of these thick-headed criminals don't seem to realize cooperation actually will make a massive difference in how your offense is handled resisting and swearing at officers is a Surefire way to get the maximum possible charges but you'll definitely receive a much better outcome if you simply act like a decent human and comply with the officer's request so I understand what do you want you were mean as hell for me I that's I was  that's I was about to say look like I think that we all got off to a little bit of a bad start I don't like it when I see somebody it look to me like you struggling and resistant put of my offic I'm going be completely honest I'm already caught I can't be no blunt than I already am I'm not I wasn't I was not complying it's no use arguing with the cops when your obstructive behavior is caught on camera and the cops body cams rarely Miss a Thing the pregnant woman may not realize this but it's not the cop's job to be  nice to you the other officers will probably be with you for a little while tonight and just just remember that respect goes both ways that our I'll make sure that our guys are respectful to you make sure that you're respectful to us as well okay just half a pet off I'm just uh I think it's my job to make sure that trying to make my my guys work as easy as possible and if somebody is is um argumentative causing a problem it makes our job I didn't say you do I'm talking about in the future that's why  I'm here talking the woman clearly seems to be missing the point entirely and her friend actually proved that she was wrong by being respectful to the cops and receiving much better treatment do you think the cops were being fair with the pregnant woman we're going to go into the open garage door here in a second you do not have to grab me every time I'm not going to run bro so there's cameras all over the place du and if I don't then and I get in trouble for not doing my job right and I don't and I  only have 11 months to do this job left and I'm not getting in trouble turns out the cop wasn't going to be doing this job much longer and this may be one of the last entitled carens he has to deal with that being said it's easy to see why he's so excited to be leaving we're pretty sure he's had to deal with his fair share of angry and entitled thieves but this woman is one he'll definitely remember everybody everybody that's scar of the police when yall so not that is so not true yeah that's what I have come  across many black people that have been very supportive of the police so good for you I support the ones that are nice so you support me you were not nice to me high five Knuckles okay see you like me you all right the statement that the woman made could not have been more false and we know that most law-abiding citizens see police officers as trustworthy and helpful instead of being offended the cop still tries to be nice with the woman and makes jokes with her she's in no mood especially considering  her situation but it's possible she's just a grumpy person in general both women were charged with retail theft the pregnant woman got slapped with the additional charge of resisting arrest our next shoplifting case takes us to the bellisfair parkway Target where a woman was spotted for shoplifting the cop gets the info from the worker and soon enough he sees the woman strolling with a full card of merchandise acting all cool as if it's a totally normal shopping trip when she did take notice of the cop she clearly  got the Fright of her life being caught in the act let's dive into this shoplifting fail so you said guy with the USA bucket hat what about did you see the guy next to him the I see the guy next to him however USA Buck guy he had a full cart left came back in with a shorter about 5' shirt who had scooter with her uh I don't know if she but last I saw she was now Lo her okay so USA bucket guy for sure school yes okay card full of stuff yes okay and what' he look like other than the USA bucket hat uh one second I want  to say he's probably 5 it's the police department stop you're under arrest can you stop her if you don't stop I'm going to grab on you okay now turn around why did you run the cops learned that this shoplifter wasn't working alone and while they had easily thwarted her plans to try and run they needed to detain all the suspects while the woman's dramatic attempt to run away way was amusing it took the cop almost no effort to catch her so what was she thinking next we turn to the male suspects in question  out of the T High FY again it's obstru step out of the car was it all right go speak with that off pleas let go face the car put your hands on the car for me put hands on the car I'm just going to FR you for weapons or I'll put you in handcuff okay you're going in handcuff you kept be grabbing a knife and then your hand was on it when I contacted you at this moment the police aren't exactly sure what's going on but they know they need to take action the first man wearing a bucket hat is placed into  to handcuffs and since he had a knife on him the cops had no idea if this was going to be a dangerous situation or not with the woman and the man now detained they could carry on their investigation knowing they weren't in danger that was perfect can we so we have her detained can we get a total on that yes sir absolutely and then I'll work on the USA guy okay thank you thanks yes back Barrow can you put your stuff in here you take this off for me okay just face the car put your hands back here I don't smoke but I have cigarettes  in the car by the time the first officer had cleared up details with the target worker the third male was already talking to the cops and the complete story would hopefully soon be pieced together the cops are even nice enough to let the shoplifting woman have a smoke probably because she cooperated very smoothly after her initial run her good behavior now may just make up for her dumb idea of running okay you can step that this going to take because honestly they just need to verify one one quick look at the camera  that said he was only in here grab a scooter and he left that's it g e r o m e j e r o m e sorry you have a midle this show uh J and a date of birth for you8 8288 like for real like I feel like this is too long already like you get a li in your pocket the other suspect Jerome is getting more antsy by the minute and we're already wondering why he's so on edge as time goes on he's only going to get more mouthy with the cops it seems how is this possible I ain't even going the store dude I ain't even going the store  James John Adam Mary Edward Sam Tracy Tom rubbert Adam Charles Young mdle are rubber 0170 no they're just keep doing this while the cop is trying to relay information to his station the male suspect keeps on rambling in the background even if like he claims he didn't go into the store at all it's clear that he's complicit in some way and his uncool and anxious behavior is definitely raising some red flags for all the cops F fishy going on here making me sick man good making me sick got all they'll figure out the theft portion  but you're going on your fony Warr after all the smart back talk the cops figured out that the man actually had a felony warrant on his name even though they could not yet confirm that he had a part in this shoplifting incident this was enough to put him in handcuffs too it's hard to imagine why you'd get Rowdy with the cops or help someone steal if you've already got a warrant but alas if these people were smarter they probably wouldn't be criminals hey Michael what else was the bucket hat so you said it was a USA bu  there was two guys with bucket hats yes so there's a guy that had the like a navy blue Buck USA on the front I want to see he's wearing a blue or dark blue or black jacket was it plaid or no I don't think it was he walking with a noticeable like hunch to him as well the entire time okay cuz there's we have one guy with a USA bucket hat on and one guy with a like a navy blue one all navy blue guy had a cart and he put everything in his car so we're guessing he stole mhm um so we have at least a female who  stole right in front of me and then we'll deal with the uh we'll deal with the male so okay um we're aren't going to charge the mail on the bucket hat yet until we can get confirmed via video which one it was uh so that stuff will be on video okay I'll give you a case number and we'll go from there finally with everything under control the cop is able to tie up the situation with the store worker as well and open an official case this was definitely one of the most exciting parts of these cops night but thankfully these criminals  weren't smart enough enough to make things difficult for the cops hey ma'am what's your first name sorry I missed it Tracy have you been trespassing Target before okay here's the deal you don't have any warrants that are bookable but you have some you need to take care of second whatever you stole talking you're going to have charges if it's felony forward at the prosecutor's office if it's misdemeanor send a ticket for theft okay you're also trespassed from Target if you return to Target and you steal you will be  arrested okay the 52-year-old woman woman Tracy is going to be taken to the police station and charged there since she's working with the cops and complying she ruined her chance of ever shopping at Target again though while the information was not released the woman was definitely charged with retail theft at a bare minimum on this day the cops were called to a local Target for a shoplifting incident where footage captured two women who were engaged stuffing bags full of store items and trying to leave  they quickly split up but what the cops were met with at the scene is definitely not what they were expecting right off the bat the first suspect tries to avoid the cops but as we all know by now this never goes down particularly well stop down there down there stop I swear to guys down there stop down here stop come here here stop I'm going out there in front of help B help B help babe help me you're rest that for what for what babe help me babe help oh I'm out with her in front of the for dealership stop put your hands behind  your back okay okay babe help me you're making this way worse for yourself I'm not biting to do anything you're making this way worse for yourself can I get get up please please can't breathe please turn around let me get up please quick get up please quick making this way worse yourself the 33-year-old really thought that her fiance on the phone would be able to help her while she was struggling on the ground resisting arrest it's clear that no one will be able to help her get out of the mess she just made for herself  and it's absolutely dumbfounding how long she maintained her struggle against the cops and I went to Sierra my fian was at Target that's that's you're looking for during a white shirt and and gray shorts tell they they said a female yeah that's her it's it's it's a female she has short hair white shirt great hands yeah that's considering the woman's situation and that she's homeless one may understand a bit more why they were driven to shoplifting this is still breaking the law though and the women  would have to face the consequences without running away we're going to find out what you stole and what you didn't stole if you're lying to us that there's a receipt on here it's not going be any good either way it's over at this point so do you really have a receipt on here or do you not have a receipt on here I have a receipt for for part of them and not all of them I'll be honest with you all right all right so there is certain things that you paid for and certain things that you didn't yes all right all  right do you want to do you want to pull that up you don't have to show us I'm just going to be honest with you the first suspect claims that some of the items she had on her were in fact paid for but considering she really wasn't able to provide any concrete proof we don't know how trustworthy this statement was considering her previous erratic Behavior well you're going to get more charges resistant so I know sir I really wasn't I really wasn't trying to I was just trying to tell you that she was down there I got that but I was  trying to tell you I I I I apologize I understand I understand hello hey how are you good so we got the one of the two we got the one that had the black bag so she has merchandise and here so she wasn't being 100% truthful with us but she said some of that is hers that she had a receipt the woman seems like a totally different person once she's in the police car and even though she's very apologetic at this point it's way too late to try and be cooperative since this ship has definitely sailed brings the car  around backpacks off everything this is what we're watching real time saw her outside going to meet her and then I put it together like oh I remember these two cool one day yeah so probably everything in here is what she had I just want to make sure there's no weapons or anything I'm just I found this the investigation goes further and after convening with the store's workers the cops find concrete video proof of the two women committing theft fortunately for them the entirety of their Reckless crimes was caught on  the store's cameras so they'd have absolutely no way of getting out of this hello how are you good is Catherine around who's Catherine Catherine white girl with short hair not that I know of not that you know of I is anyone else in there with you no not that I know of I just got in here I was next door so okay is this just take a quick look we're just looking for C I can't give you permission to do that is this your place no it's not my place when the cops arrive at the supposed living accommodations of Catherine and the  first woman someone else opens the door and like many people in the sketchier areas of town the woman was extremely skeptical and denied knowing anything about Catherine at first if she's here boom boom boom summons on her way but we don't find her today she got warrant she goes right to jail so you all right okay I just we just got to leave this a little bit this is almost starting to feel like a movie at this stage and when the cops explain the situation to the woman she suddenly disappears inside  again without a word this was quite unexpected and the strange Behavior almost makes us feel on edge what do she do what does she do I mean if she's not like family we can't really say but I can tell you for sure that it's it's a minor thing disorderly person's thing not the end of the world I think she knows hi Catherine how are you hold on want to put that down thank you for coming out we appreciate going to Fat you down make sure you do anything just a minor thing at Target you know it's about if you have any  drugs or anything on you that's going to hurt me poke me nothing nothing nothing all right okay finally Catherine makes her long awaited appearance and we can finally put a face to the other half of the shoplifting Duo at least she's complying at the moment and this definitely does count in her favor unfortunately it doesn't look like she'll be able to find all the stolen goods she'd already discarded which does count against her a bit problem is you guys ran Hold On Tight nobody knows what's going on it's  you know like s to said it's minor so you know don't need to make a mountain out of a molehill right let your head get in there you have any warrants or anything out for you no okay well things go smoothly you'll get released on the summon right this investigation thankfully has a drama-free ending and the second woman didn't put up any fight while being handcuffed and taken to the police station unlike her fiance can't all criminals just be this nice after being detained both women were transported to  jail and both were very likely charged with shoplifting charges it was September 7th of 2023 when the simol county sheriff's department received a call about a shoplifting woman at Target who tried to sneak past the point of sale checkpoint points and according to staff she'd been frequenting the store at least two to three times daily most likely stealing on every one of these occasions Miss LaTasha she's more than capable of speaking but she did let me know that um she is living out of a hotel right now  she's having a hard time managing and paying for her stuff relatives or anybody here she had her mom was just calling from her from New York she said um you want to chat with her you're more than welcome too I understand I understand all right so bre um are you going to uh I would like to uh prosecute and tresp for this in majority of the time yes she was here last night and she did steal alcohol last night as well she stole alcohol today but those are the most like frivolous things I've seen like that I'm going to start compiling  on my end um I'm actually going to oh you mind if I take a picture oh sure the woman is clearly a mom but is shocking is the fact that she was stealing alcohol this is far from the worst thing she's done the cops were about to learn a shocking piece of information that would change the course of this investigation for the worst no don't oh so they have two young kids in the car and a baby in the car okay might as well call the you have your ID on [Music] you hold on give me one second hey what's going on do you have kids in your  car H do you have children in your car do you have children in your car yes okay yeah yeah hold on let me give me a second I'm I'm going to read her Miranda I'll call you back we learned the unimaginable that even though this woman had a young child with her and was giving the girl the items to try and steal she actually left two young children locked in her hot car one was a young boy and one was barely an infant and it's clear that this investigation just got a lot more serious I'm living in Al to I'm just having a hard time  right now I get it and we all have hard times I know so but we have a bigger issue right now how many children are in your car right now two kids what are their ages my son is 10 10 and my daughter is one one so you got a 10-year-old and a one-year-old in the car that's it okay all right and then how old is she four she's four hi four okay so how many times have you been at this target right here and stolen items I don't remember I'm not sure so it's just been a a whole bunch of times the woman admits that she can't even  count the number of times time she stolen from this target but even though she's now facing a serious shoplifting charge her criminal child neglect is the much more pressing issue we can understand that everyone runs into struggles but this doesn't explain why the woman was stealing alcohol so all right so you are trespassed from this particular Target okay if you do come back to this target you will be subject to arrest okay I do have to take a photo of you did you get the vehicle open I can just open  it they got the vehicle open they broke the window it's concerning that the woman's first concern was if the cops had broken her car's window instead of asking if her kids were okay and this is making us quickly lose any sympathy we may have had for this shoplifter so I'm going to go ahead leave this car open so you guys can get some fresh air okay all right uh um what's your name um and that's your sister brother yeah going to be in the fifth grade make sure you guys getting some air condition see make sure you guys get  some get some air over there okay like I said the other I'm wait for the other Deputy see what he wants to do and then we're go from there okay chocolate P cookie the nice mail cop took great care of the kids and made sure they could enjoy some fresh air for a change and this is the kind of great service we'd love to see from police officers after a chat with the young boy and determining that the kids were okay the investigation into their mother's offense could continue because I don't know like how this works I've never been  a Dr so I have to take I I don't know like how long I'm going to be there so they need food to eat go Ahad and stand up your hand hey how you doing just come and pick up the kids you are yeah oh I'm the dance what's your name sorry your name yeah can you tell me what happened um yeah if you want to close the door the cops were being extremely nice to the woman and they even ensured that her daughter did not have to see her being arrested once she was out of the room though the officers placed the  shoplifting woman into handcuffs and thankfully the kid's dad had arrived to take the three of them home so their mom got caught steing out of that and so she's going to jail no not steing stealing yeah what what now when you say stealing that's what we I don't know exactly what she took or what she you know and of course this isn't the first time so you know so let me call you right back let me call you right back the dad seems confused and surprised urised by the entire situation and we can expect that  any parent would be quite shocked at finding out their young children had been witnessed to and dragged into a serious crime we definitely feel sorry for this poor guy now let me ask a question what like this is what she stole no what did she St she actually she actually asked us if we could not disclose information whoever was coming to pick up um it it will obviously be public record and you'll be able to see it anyway um but this I'll just say this isn't the first time no she's never been I'm saying this isn't the first time

A262	https://youtu.be/0Jl7l_d1Hek?si=YXtGfna5lik-GbcH	your appearance this morning because I'm not sure if I even have everything I apologize for that it's all right when you're ready um here's third party intervening that matter appearance authorized representative from our client our set for Value in return for Value although the charging instruments in this matter and make my exemption available for discharge of all obligations and charges connected with this case I do not dispute any of the facts and the charging instruments and make a reservation of all of my  constitutional rights mostly the first the sixth and the 14th amendments foreign in custody in person he is wearing his jail attire this morning I do want to make a record that at 8 46 PM yesterday I did swear in two additional sheriff's deputies who would be working with our jurors through the overnight or third shift hours I did administer the same oath that was administered to all the other bailiffs um yesterday evening then of course we are open and the jurors are here and they will be instructed to start their deliberations  the only other thing I would put on the record is I have received information regarding the Reddit post that there was a subsequent post from that website indicating that it was a prank and so I know I don't know to what extent the sheriff's department is looking into that as well but it's my understanding based on news reports that that entire post or site was taken down not the site of Reddit but it's no longer I believe viewable but there was that additional information regarding that at least from the  administrator I believe of that post so I just wanted to put that on the record and uh if and when or I should say when the investigation is completed I will assure the parties that you will be provided with that information so go ahead so it's being called a prank per the Reddit post itself yes so we so we don't have any ideas that's a fact though right you're correct I'm just putting on the record the additional information that's been reported on um and then again once the sheriff's department concludes their investigation  it will be turned over to the parties so at this point um until there's a question or a verdict courtroom will remain open I'm going to be working in my office on other things and will be available of course if there are any questions or if a verdict is reached so notify the parties oh go ahead um I'm still very concerned about this whole uh reading thing after having the chance to fully read it and um look at some of the language that's in it um it's very concerning that's why there's an investigation sir  it's anytime there's an allegation that the Integrity of this judicial process has been compromised especially with a juror I take that incredibly seriously which is why I turned it over to the Sheriff's Department I would uh like your honor to if it pleases the the court and if it pleases your honor I would like to look at some alternatives if if I may bring up the uh And in regards to the language I also want to state that uh for the record uh this did not come about from the prosecution side from the  defense society and shutting me not from your Underside this is something that just pretty much sprang up a lot of my concern though just not from just the language and the actual post but um I was kind of concerned that I was the last one to learn of this information that had been known because I wasn't aware of it until after 6 30 last night um go around that time because I don't want to misquote the record but somewhere around that time it was shortly after seven oh so it was after I didn't know I I  thought it was I knew it was after 6 30 but I didn't want to incorrect incorrectly state uh the record you're gonna address that for you right now if you would like yeah uh if you please just you it pleases your honor I would like to uh request some alternatives to to this uh issue um what's your specific request my Pacific specific request would be to uh look into a mistrial and also any alternatives uh along those lines short of that or along those lines or a mistrial um I was looking at some obviously  yesterday was very very long for for everybody um and as you know because of my status uh hearing the jail I'm allowed to have a law library time up until a certain point of the evening and then I have to shut it down per jail policy uh so I was I was able to find a few different things that I wanted to bring to uh your honors attention if I may go ahead um one being uh United States versus Perez uh 22 us 579 and that's specifically I think it's referenced because that one is pretty old in itself but it's referenced in a  lot of the other uh case laws that I actually found I think and I could be if I'm interpreting this incorrectly I apologize um they kind of use that as kind of like the benchmark for what they refer to as uh manifest necessity that's kind of like one of the leading cases that each one references in regards to issues similar to to things like this when it when it comes into play uh and is specifically uh points to uh trial judge's discretion and uh I think that's kind of like the leading one also I looked at uh  Brown versus Russian Rush Rushton uh five seven two F dot three d uh 198. which speaks to the languages basically it speaks to the same thing it speaks about uh manifest necessity uh it speaks about a if there's an issue exculpatory evidence things of that nature um also uh United States versus Bates uh that's b-a-t-e-s 917 F 2D 388 um and that speaks of uh potential for in in partial verdict specifically it says it uh a lot of lines of uh impartial verdict if an impartial verdict can be reached  or if a verdict of conviction could be reached but would have to be reversed on appeal due to an obvious procedural error in the trial that's one of the main issues that that that speaks to I also looked at uh Arizona versus Washington oh four three four us four nine seven and that speaks to what I was stating before um it says neither party in the case has a right to have his case decided by a jury which may be attended by bias and I say that because it certainly wasn't uh any anything dealing with the  prosecution they had nothing to do with this the defense had nothing to do with this and certainly you urinary had nothing to do with this but just for the concern Factor of the language uh it's pretty clear that this if not directly came from a juror who sits on this panel it came from someone who sits in this courtroom every single day the language it it directed towards you your honor directed towards the having clear bodies towards the defense some of the things that they quoted of having knowledge of is is extremely  concerning extremely concerning and then going back to some of these uh case laws that I cited it talks about um something to the effect of uh you know the the ends of public Justice but I think that is leaning more so towards the judge's discretion I would say at least from how I was interpreting interpreting it obviously I'm not educated in a lot of the laws in itself but how I was interpreting it um this is definitely definitely a concerning issue it's definitely something that I would request your honor to take a a a  a long look at [Music] um look at some options look at some internal alternatives then those those case laws outside it talks specifically about that option is that um you your honor can can look at and and use your discretion to see if it's appropriate in any in any way but I'm extremely concerned about this um if if anything for cautionary reasons um I believe your honor that you definitely should um take a look at everything I'm I'm saying here in these case laws and and uh what's the request though that you're  making based upon the case law that you cite I heard in their mistrial but I want to make sure I understand the your request for Relief and what it is you said requests for relief relief what are you asking me to do based upon the information that we The Limited information we have about the Reddit post in this trial um I guess my request would be because of the concern of this to look at a mistrial or at the very least a discharge of the jury at this time so this can be resolved this is this is  this is alarming to say the least um this post and I I don't know where Reddit is to be honest I've I've never heard of it or used it so I don't know the extent of it's almost like this could be like a snowball type of thing it can it can start with something that that's this small and then it can snowball out of control into something totally different I don't know the extent of this website [Music] I don't know who well I think the name of the person who sent the uh to who alerted the clerk of course to  uh to this post I think his name is is is in um the email but then that even actually begs the question of how did this person come across this site what is their significance to this was their role in this it's just so many questions and I mean clearly this this points that the Court's Integrity appoints that your integrity your honor it's it's alarming it's very alarming and if there's a chance that there can be hidden bias in this jury it needs to be addressed now rather than later this is very concerning  foreign thank you for bringing up your concerns let me turn to the state if you want to respond and then see what other issues they want to cover this morning judge the original post was on a subreddit thread called Justice for Daryl that's the copy that defendant has in front of him that post was edited last night claiming that it was a prank from the start and that the original poster was uh didn't think it would get that far out of hand the way that Reddit works the only person who can mod uh excuse me modify  the content of the original post is the original poster and because the jurors have um no access to any electronic devices I think it's safe to say that our 12 jurors back there are not one of are not the original poster so I think that that puts that issue pretty much to bed it's still obviously under investigation because the the court takes it so seriously but there really is no actionable or any real reason why we should doubt the jury's being unbiased in this case like you just stayed it's an  investigation going on and if there's a investigation then that clearly says that something is amiss um we have 16 well 15. we got 15 jurors we still too many questions that we don't know too many um I don't think anything's put to bed because we don't know it's it's unfair to say that the issue was put to bed when there's still so many questions left out there I'm sure you reviewed it yourself your honor you you see the language in this whatever it is thread I don't know I don't know what this is  clearly a post from somebody who has intimate knowledge of of the trial and and and what's going on in the trial I don't think I mean common sense with would tell you that this is someone who's very close to the case whether whether they were intended to be funny rather they were intending to try to uh prank the court or anything like that we don't know that could be anybody's guess the language in this the way that the way it is formatted they lay out four specific points of what what they think  they uh they point to a certain language in in the case uh they make references to saying when we were in the room they got certain feelings from when deep where they specifically refer to themselves and a group that would be we plural um they they say and I have to admit I am biased against the defendant for the horrible acts he did and and they attack you your honor they clearly attack you this this is this is if this is I it's someone's idea fun is is anybody's guess but I don't believe that it is clearly  by the way it's formatted and by the language that that is in it this is clearly someone with intimate knowledge of the case and what's going on clearly there's no other way there's no other way to interpret this you can tell by just by the what they're laying out in the language that they're speaking with if this is clearly someone close to the case and because of that it still has to be uh I'm informed in the investigation but there's still too many questions left in the air just from this how can we say  anything's put to bed when there's still a an investigation for all we know what if what if this turns up that it was someone on a jury or what if it turns out that more people are involved in it than just whoever this Anonymous uh person was who left the post it's too many questions and it's too concerning what if something like this Springs up again at the last minute we've we've been going through the trial now for basically three weeks the better part of three weeks and even even in uh court dates leading  up to the trial we've never had anything like this happen nothing like this has been brought to your attention nothing like this has been been brought before the Court's attention is this just came out of the blue and now all of a sudden is is being labeled a prank is that because they were found out I mean it it begs so many questions it's it's too uncertain it's it's too concerning it's too alarming it's too alarming to just Overlook and say oh well we'll just we'll just set it to the side and let  that no this this there has to be some type of Alternatives and some type something has to be done something and if that's a mistrial if that's uh uh discharging a jury if that's some other type of Alternatives that can be looked at I'm sure that uh these case law speaks to other options that could come into play they deserve to at least be looked at if if anything to protect the Integrity of the trial I I find it very hard to believe that this close um to the trial being over and all of a sudden  these issues are being raised so this is obviously not a prank and it's obvious that this is someone with intimate knowledge it's it's very it's very clear to me well let me address your concerns sir I cannot make conclusions at this point about whether this is legitimate or prank what I know is as follows I received the information about the subreddit post at approximately 9 30 9 40 yesterday morning I and I alone made the decision to withhold advising the parties because of where we were at in  the trial because there was nothing in that post it was an anonymous post that would lend credibility to that it was in fact one of these jurors but out of an abundance of caution I referred it to law enforcement because it is very serious if the Integrity of these proceedings were to be put at issue by a juror I'd remind you though every single day these jurors were read the bulk of jury instruction 50. they all took an oath and I have no reason to doubt that they would violate that oath at this time  so I took and I made the decision to withhold telling the parties because we were in the middle of instructing the jury I was in the middle of instructing the jury and I wasn't going to delay the proceedings because it was so speculative at that point and remains speculative at this point as you know the case went to the jury I brought this up I weighed in about a half an hour once the case went to the jury frankly we had had a long day I wanted to get a bit to eat and then I wanted to come back out and make a  record of what I had once again the forensic unit with the sheriff's department has taken lead of this investigation I'm not a part of that investigation law enforcement will handle it from my perspective not only did the Clerk of Court's Office receive emails regarding this it sounds like the district attorney received emails I may have even gotten one I don't remember the time it was later regarding the post frankly people figure out my email all the time it was not solicited by me in any way and I did not respond to it and  I simply forwarded that email on the law enforcement so it's pretty clear to me that a lot of people have access to Reddit I personally am not a user of Reddit so I don't know the ins and outs of it other than it is a social media site where people can create accounts and post and there can be like chat rooms for example or just various as this is called subreddits um and at this point you've requested a mistrial you've requested that I discharge the jury I'm declining to do that at this time sir again I need to  make decisions based upon the record that's before me and right now the record is speculative there are no facts to support a mistrial or discharging the jury I trust the parties will continue in their own independent investigations that you will continue reviewing case law make whatever request that you deem appropriate I certainly will take time to look at the cases you have cited to see if there's anything based upon the requests that you have made that I would need to further review but at this time  I do not see grounds for a mistrial I do not see grounds to discharge the jury um and that is how I will address it at this point I know the state I believe wanted to address something else I'm not sure if that was it but you had deferred to Mr Brooks so go ahead are there is there anything you want me to address or at least bring to the Court's attention it's just a minor Point you're under you had noted the defendant is in his orange jail uniform today it's my understanding the jail did offer him the ability to  put on his street clothes and he declined so I just wanted that on the record um there may be occasions where this jury has to be brought into the courtroom for one reason or another and he should be in civilian close um if that occurs if he chooses to it's a good point to bring up it is possible the jury would need to be brought out if there is any question that I need to answer on the record if for some reason the technology we're not to be working appropriately when videos or other evidence are displayed to them  and so it is possible that the jury would need to come out of course they'll come out if and when a verdict is reached so I would certainly give you the opportunity sir if you want to change into the street clothes that I would certainly direct the sheriff's department to make that available for you should you choose is your name my choice yes it is so wow why do I need to be in street clothes why does that need to be on the record that your choice should be placed on the records if or if not I was offered to be  in street clothes if I made it the choice do you dispute that sir yes I dispute it because it's my choice this morning at this point there's no reason why that should be on the record that if or if I was not offered street clothes would rather relevancy does that have to could have potential relevancy later on if you were to challenge that you and claim that you were required to wear your jail uniform or jail attire you're not required you have the right to wear street clothes and I will certainly provide that  opportunity should you wish to change at any point in time but what you're telling me is it's your choice to be in jail attire I'll respect that choice of course so why does that need to be stated for the record I just indicated why sir so I don't I don't see the relevancy of it all right at this point um unless there are any further issues I am going to go back into my office the courtroom will remain open and we'll let you know when the jury communicates with us either about a question or verdicts  there is something that needs to be addressed subject matter jurisdiction the court declines that I'm stepping off why does it have why hasn't it been proven on the record game

A278	https://youtu.be/1WYYKshG9Tk?si=0NXmRuCjAdZHcDRI	you're in no position to lecture the public about anything you know nothing about the real world most of you spent less time in school than Greta thumberg ah diversity something that sounds fine on paper and when done with genuine good intentions is great but when it became about promotion virtue signaling and apparently the only thing that makes a movie good I knew we were entering a dark period of Cinema we're living through another repressive time when it comes to cinema but now audiences have  finally caught on and they're holding companies like Disney and Marvel Studios to account saying yes be diverse but make sure the damn movie is also good because audiences are now realizing that diversity isn't What Makes a Movie good or bad it's just simply diverse what makes the movie good is if people liked the character if they honored The Source material if they crafted a good story and gave good performances people Now understand that it's those basic film making elements that make or break a  story and it has nothing to do with diversity despite what these Studios try and push in their marketing schemes but now that audiences have realized this and Disney Marvel Now know that they can't keep doing the same marketing trick they are finally making some changes because in a recent report it's been released that Marvel have fired 15 employees some of which being producers that were involved in some of these terrible films and not only have they fired these producers but we were also told a few weeks ago that they had cut  multiple projects which they didn't name but through reported leaks we were able to piece together that these films were none other than the leaders of Marvel's diversity push with movies like The Eternal sequel being cancelled as well as the Marvel Sequel and apparently now shangi as well however I must say that that is still in the air and we don't know how accurate those reports are because we're getting multiple reports conflicting each other so we don't really know where they're going with  shangqi too but what we do know now for sure is that they fired 15 employees and have also cancelled the eternals and the Marvels and now here's the thing I'm genuinely sad that diverse projects that had a lot of potential were absolutely ruined because while some wackos will say that anything with a black guy or a woman is quote unquote woke trash the reality is that diversity doesn't make or break a movie it all comes down to the quality and that's why we were able to get a great movie in the first black  panther a great movie in Avengers endgame yet on the flip side get something abs absolutely terrible like the Marvels or Echo because once again it's not diversity that makes or breaks the story it's the story itself and so if Marvel genuinely wanted to represent women and different cultural backgrounds in a good way they would have made sure that the movies were excellent but what I think I've realized through the last few years of terrible diverse projects is that they may have tried to use the  diversity angle so they could be lazy with quality but still try and attract an audience and even though there were a couple projects that were diverse yet still good like shangqi which definitely had some flaws but was still a pretty solid intro for the hero but most of the diverse projects they made were things like eternals She-Hulk Echo and the Marvels which were all just so ridiculously terrible movie star well I am but I am also an eternal comedy and it was those projects that really went to show that there was  hardly any quality Behind these stories it didn't feel like there was any real effort put into trying to craft a good story it was all just about the simple fact that it was diverse and apparently that was the only reason we should like the stories and the negative impacts of this go Way Beyond just terrible movies but it also so hurts people's careers because Disney went and hired Khloe Jiao who was a great Indie director but had no Blockbuster experience and Marvel completely threw her under the bus all  in the name of diversity and while yes she didn't have to accept the movie given that she had no experience dealing with that kind of source material or Blockbusters of that scale I'm sure the paycheck was so good you would have had to have been an idiot to turn it down except it has come back to bite her because a movie like the eternals being so bad is definitely going to hinder her career moving forward especially in the Blockbuster space yes she can continue to make great Indie movies but if she  ever wants to step up to that Blockbuster level and start earning some really good money she's most likely going to struggle to get that opportunity just given the fact that the eternals was such a massive disaster and the same thing happened with She-Hulk actress Tatiana misani who had delivered great performances in other shows and films and then she came in to play a relatively well-liked hero in the Marvel Comics except Marvel Studios completely destroyed that character in the show and also as a byproduct of that have  actually destroyed her career as well basically doing the same thing to Tatiana misani as Disney did to Daisy Ridley where the actress has talent but flops on such a big scale that it's hard to shake and I'm sure other Studios would be nervous to work with her just given how many Marvel fans are out there and how many Marvel fans hated that show and so it really proves to be the worst strategy possible for Disney Marvel to try and use diversity as a marketing scheme because at the end of the day it  doesn't even result in the shows or movies getting good reviews or making money at the box office as obviously Captain Marvel 1 made a billion dollars but that was at a time where every Marvel movie was making money and Marvel hadn't really developed a bad reputation yet except now people can see through the bluff they can see that Marvel weren't putting good stories in these movies because they thought that diversity was enough and now they're not supporting the films and that's why the Captain Marvel sequel the Marvels  completely flopped at the box office so much so that it was the worst MCU box office performance of all time all because people Now understand the grift people Now understand that just because it's diverse doesn't mean it's going to be good and the same goes the other way even when something isn't diverse is about a straight white male hero it can still also suck and that's what we've seen with Thor love and thunder and Ant-Man 3 where there was once again a terrible story terrible execution of the  film and that's why those movies also got completely roasted on the internet because like I said nothing to do with diversity these are just terrible movies and so to end the video I thought I'd offer a solution and strategy to try and fix this problem because while anyone can just whine on the internet I do want to offer some constructive feedback to try and save an industry that we all love so much and the crazy thing is is that I think you could actually fix this problem in three simple steps with the  first one being to make sure that there's actually a story to tell because you have to ask yourself before you create a movie around a diverse character is there genuinely a good story to tell here and there are a few characters that do have a good story to tell like shangi Gamora and Y Elena those are people that you can work with those are people that you could end up telling a good story and help benefit the MCU so why not just focus on those three that have a good story to tell and cut characters like Ekko and the  eternals where there was never a really good story to tell and the only reason they were even going with those Heroes was to try and expand their universe and try and bring in more diversity and it utterly backfired that's not saying that those characters in the eternals OR Eko herself can't work in the future but until you've actually worked out what you want to say with that character don't bring them into the MCU shangqi clearly has a road map for the future clearly they knew what they wanted to  say with that character same goes for y Elena and same has gone for Gamora since she entered the MCU and this is meant to be a simple strategy that works for any hero that you're bringing into the franchise for SP Spiderman for Doctor Strange for Iron Man these Heroes succeeded because there was a story to tell so make sure you do that for the diverse characters too and then to the Second Step don't bite off more than you can chew I think what serves the MCU well is when they keep the story line  tight Compact and most importantly concise so have a cast that people actually like work together well and will continue to drive the story of the MCU forward without taking it in too many different directions and the crazy thing about that cast is you could have a diverse one that works for the story and fans care about and that cast would include people like Spider-Man y Elena Doctor Strange Thor Nick Fury Gamora shangqi and Miss Marvel yes there are other Heroes that will also work within this story but those heroes are just an  example of how you can pick and choose the right ones which bring diversity to the franchise yet still allow it to be loved by millions and still tells a good story and then the third and final step would be to make sure that there's a higher frequency of Avengers movies because I think they've gone too long since Avengers endgame which I understand that was the end of the road for that story line but you need to keep the Avengers that are left coming back together every couple of years because  it just allows the story to be more streamlined and it also tells the audience what Heroes they should be focused on and what the story is working towards because they should have added more Avengers out of the good characters that they introduced to the MCU and also allowed Spider-Man to take the mantle as the leader of the Avengers and if it wasn't him then it should have gone to someone like Doctor Strange as well and it would have just kept it more streamlined kept the MCU moving in a good direction and made sure that they  didn't go in too many different directions with too many different characters that have ultimately backfired and completely destroyed Marvel's reputation because no one knows where the story is going or who they should be focused on because I think with those three simple steps you could save this franchise make sure that people are enjoying the story line and still have diversity because I can't stress it enough diversity doesn't ruin or make a movie all diversity is is just simply being diverse so why don't you  just bring the focus back to telling good stories but what are your thoughts on this let me know Down Below in the comments if you like the video please hit the like button hit the Subscribe button and I'll see you all on my next video

C102	https://youtu.be/CjetWrsQb-E?feature=shared	 Now, Mo Rocca, with a closer look at a period in our history both maligned and misunderstood. Call it the original Great Escape.   On May 13, 1862, just over a year into the Civil War, an enslaved man named Robert Smalls, who labored on a Confederate steamer in South Carolina's Charleston Harbor, set into motion a daring plan. He saw that the Confederate crew had left, and he knew that oftentimes they left for the evening, not to come back until the next day.   As his great-great-grandson Michael Boulware Moore explains, for Smalls and six other slaves and their families, the stakes couldn't have been higher. They knew that if they got caught, that they would be not just killed, but probably tortured in a particularly egregious and public manner. Disguising himself in the top hat and long overcoat of a Confederate captain, Smalls piloted the ship past Fort Sumter towards the Union blockade.   and freedom it really blew people's minds because you know it just was beyond what people thought an enslaved person could do not every great story has to become a movie but i mean come on there's so many twists and turns in the story that would be just amazing and how about this for a second act   After returning home to Beaufort, South Carolina, Robert Smalls was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, one of more than a dozen African Americans to serve in Congress during the period known as Reconstruction, when the formerly rebel states were reabsorbed into the Union and four million newly freed African Americans were made citizens.   It was a time of unparalleled hope. Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates has produced a new documentary about Reconstruction, airing this month on PBS. When you look at the radical, amazing changes that happened within a few years of the demise of slavery, there was a kind of irrational exuberance.   Gates says Reconstruction is one of the most misunderstood chapters in American history. Black men could vote, and they were about to elect congressmen to represent them throughout the South. I mean, you go and you ask people on the street who the first Black person was elected to the U.S. Congress, they're going to guess it's the 1960s, the 1970s. And they would never guess it was Hiram Revels from Mississippi.   Hiram Rhodes Revels was born free and served as a chaplain to black regiments during the Civil War. On February 25, 1870, he was sworn in as a senator from Mississippi, an office once held by Jefferson Davis, who left the Senate to become president of the Confederacy.   Is this a big national moment? Oh, it's a historic moment, and it's memorialized in the famous Currier and Ives lithograph that shows the first senator and members of the House of Representatives who were African Americans. The famed printing house created this lithograph featuring the African American members of Congress, all of them Southerners, all of them Republicans, in 1872. Wow, look at that.   Harvard University's Houghton Library houses one of the few known copies. When Frederick Douglass saw the portrait of Hiram Revels, he said, at last the black man is represented as something other than a monkey.   So some of these men seven years before are slaves. That's right, absolutely. There were only two of these men who were born free. It's the first time in this country, or really anywhere, that an interracial democracy was created. Columbia University historian Eric Foner estimates that about 2,000 African Americans held some kind of public office during Reconstruction.   We tend to think of slaves as ignorant or unsophisticated, but, you know, they had been living in American society for their whole lives, and their parents had too. The slave trade from Africa had ended long before. These people were Americans.   And they wanted the same rights, the same opportunities as free white people had. How gutsy was it for these guys not just to try to be elected, but to get seated and to actually demand equality?   Lawrence Otis Graham wrote a book about Mississippi Senator Blanche K. Bruce, who was born a slave in Virginia before becoming a successful plantation owner in Mississippi. Bruce and his wife Josephine were one of the wealthiest African-American couples in America and lived in this townhouse in an integrated Washington, D.C. neighborhood. This is not someone who was in over their head. This was someone who, despite all the odds against him, succeeded   enormously. The year he's seated in the Senate, 1875, is the apex of Black representation during Reconstruction. Seven House members and one senator. So that's the high point. Yeah, no, it is. And so, but he doesn't get to enjoy that high point very long with his colleagues.   When neither candidate in the 1876 presidential election secured enough votes in the Electoral College to be declared winner, a deal was struck. Southern Democrats agreed to back Republican candidate Rutherford B. Hayes. In exchange, the federal troops who had protected Black voters were withdrawn from the South. Black voting rights were gradually stripped away, and Black representation in Congress faded.   Reconstruction was over and the Jim Crow era of segregation began. For most of the 20th century, Reconstruction was portrayed as a failure   This is how the South Carolina state legislature was depicted in D.W. Griffith's 1915 The Birth of a Nation. That movie, which cast the Ku Klux Klan as heroes, was a sensation with white audiences. President Woodrow Wilson even hosted a screening at the White House.   And most schools taught Reconstruction as a misadventure at best. That's what I was taught in high school in the 1950s. Reconstruction was the worst period in American history. It was a travesty of democracy. Black people misused the right to vote, were not capable of serving in public office. That was taught everywhere.   For a young Henry Louis Gates, this was particularly painful. And the few black kids in my class would put the textbook up over our face and slink down in our chairs because it was all so embarrassing. But over the last 25 years, reconstruction in some schools has been given a much fuller treatment. As soon as African-Americans have the right to vote, they become a majority in several southern states.   And in 2017, the Reconstruction-era National Monument was established in Robert Smalls' hometown of Beaufort, South Carolina. Just down the road, you can see the house he lived in as a free man and the church he attended.   Alongside it is a bust of Smalls, the only known statue in the South of any of the pioneering black congressmen of Reconstruction. They were no different than other congressmen. They weren't all great geniuses, and they weren't rabble like you saw in Birth of a Nation. I think the black congressmen are worth studying, not only in their own right, but as symbols of a very big effort in our history to make this an interracial democracy. 	Leaning Liberal			Center	30
C103	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf87524RNoU	yeah unfortunately the title of the video is not misleading Mr Lonely himself Aon is behind a massive scam if any of you watching grew up in the 9s or early 2000s I'm sure that name Rings a lot of bells because Aon is an artist who was responsible for some absolutely iconic boner jams back in the day and a few years ago he decided to pitch a city Aon city which would be powered by the blockchain and have their own form of currency called AC coin and I've got to tell you the the design documents here  the blueprints the the renders of what acon city could look like are so outrageous it almost makes the Willy Wonka experience look like a good idea I feel like everyone who takes even a glance at the proposed Aon City documents will immediately write it off as being impossible and just a load of baloney and they'd be 100% right in that assumption this will never happen this city looks like something out of Final Fantasy it's just not really feasible yet Aon as well as other collaborators are doing their best to try and make it  a reality though after years of work the only thing they have this show for it is a single Welcome Center that has a graffitied picture of Aon on the side and it doesn't really welcome you to anything CU there's nothing to show for it it just welcomes you to something that's emptier than my colon after eating Greek yogurt first thing in the morning it takes you to basically just an empty field though there is a single building skeleton in there that has a staircase and that's it and then just a  bunch of cattle roaming freely so there is no real progress being made on Aon City and it really seems like from the beginning this was supposed to be just either a full-blown scam or just a narcissistic ego piece for a for Aon because it makes no sense why Aon would introduce a cryptocurrency to Aon City when a lot of African regions already use cryptocurrency in their day-to-day lives if he was really trying to make this a real thing that wasn't just trying to take advantage and exploit people it would  have made more sense for him to just use the already established Bitcoin or ethereum which is prevalent throughout Africa but instead he introduced his own cryptocurrency and said I am the bank he also is the douchebag behind acoin a ton of early investors so they actually did sell acoin and a lot of people bought into it and then it immediately collapsed it went from 1003 132% gain to a 60% loss and then started offering refunds and all these investors when trying to get their refund basically just got cold  shouldered and never got their refunds for this they they basically just got rugged like everyone else with the the crypto boom a few years ago but anyway I recommend checking out Patrick CC's video for an in-depth look at a lot of what went on behind the scenes at Aon City and Aon himself here I want to show you what acon city was supposed to look like and how stupid this entire project seems just from like an outside perspective it really looks like an impossible to complete task that somehow  acon promised would be done by 2024 and yet all they have right now is like a Bare Bones welcome center and like a single like skeleton of another building that's about as bad as the Soulja Boy Game Boy okay show a little respect for the Soulja console also aon's city is so much worse than just releasing a fraudulent game console it is disgusting to compare the two aon's city is like the most egregious over-the-top scam like it's so much worse Aon actually has a video showcasing it look up this is  Aon City I don't think I ever saw this I only ever read about Aon City so here's the entertainment District what are these these aren't even buildings this looks like when you go on Roller Coaster Tycoon and up the terrain what who who's your architect this is what it looks like when you like actually trip acid for the first time it's even bad CG yeah it's melted yeah I guess their Chief Architect is Salvador Del brought him back with the Aon City in-house Necromancer the tech District what does  this mean Tech 3421 what tech what what what is the tech what what are they doing here Lex Luther live here or something what what does this mean what does it mean butt plug City yeah I mean not wrong this all does look like something you'd find on Bad Dragon health and safety wait hold on hold on that oh wait it's this building I thought he just reused tech1 here for the health and safety building but it's this building they're just side by side yeah this is the police station here they inhabit this pack of hot dogs  here's the fire department which is conveniently placed in the worst possible position for them to get anywhere CU they're going to have to navigate this Minefield this Labyrinth good luck having a quick response time from the firefighters unspecified office building I guess Residential Building General Hospital outpatient clinic this is another Residential Building just this Coral game name oh no this is this is a city this is this is a uh Aon City in real life apparently they actually did build a building though so I'm going to  have to check that out I never saw this video go up for it education District this is education one education 2 education 3 so I'm guessing this is prek kindergarten middle school high school and then everyone Parks here in this tier this tear drop and then another Residential Building OS Osmosis Jones type landscape bro modeled the city from the mitochondria yeah yeah true true so here's the scen wood district oh here acon Tower he's even got his own like Avengers building so this is where acon lives and only  Aon wait wasn't this in the tech District isn't this building already occupied by Tech am I misremembering the layout it might be too sophisticated for my tiny little reptile brain but I'm pretty sure that was one of the tech buildings oh no it's right here it's right above Tech 4 then a bunch of filming Studios more residential buildings some more Office Buildings in this random media tower I guess looks like a cactus theme park yeah convenient location all of this looks like Hitachi wands it looks less like butt plugs and  it legitimately looks like the things you'd see in porn those like really uh uh riby wands looks like crypto Land 2.0 well apparently it's powered by the blockchain so it kind of is cryptand 2.0 I have to imagine whoever put this presentation together was actually laughing so hard as they charged Aon and exorb amount for it yeah I'll throw this piece of together for like I don't know like 3 million bucks done shake my hand looks like a pretty cool place to live I don't know what I'm looking at here it's just random jpegs that are  floating through on this building but how could you not smile if you lived in a place like Aon City all right let's see the current Aon City do we really need an explanation for why Aon City will never happen I think we all know just by looking at the design blueprints there come on building has like futuristic curvatures outside it definitely looks like something out of wakanda but only one building so far whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa what was this wait what this is so this is there right now also you you should proba have  someone else come in and do the artwork on the side of your building why that looks like extremely low poly it's like a PS1 render of Aon you could definitely find a better artist for that in March 2022 Stevens asked the judge to freeze aon's New York assets claiming that without the measure Aon would have difficulty repaying an alleged debt Steven's lawyer Jeffrey moit alleged in his affidavit that Aon City and Aon exhibited many of the trademark characteristics of a fraudulent business venture such as onzi  schemes and pyramid schemes Aon city was likely a scam Aon denied the allegations about Aon City the following month he paid 850k to settle part of the ongoing lawsuit he said the motion to Freeze's accounts has been made out of spite I mean likely a scam is very generous it is 100% a scam in every possible version of the word it is official that's the only thing they've built at acon city it's just a welcome center with his face on it well why can't I does anyone ever pay a visit to the Welcome Center I want to  see it 	Liberal			Liberal	31

C193	https://youtu.be/026RvKgYTH8?si=p62C20X2-lQHU9a4	hey y' Mesa Mena here there's one thing I wish Christians knew about deconstruction it isn't that being lgbtq isn't a sin it isn't that hell isn't real it isn't even that Skillet actually sucks it's that people who deconstruct their faith were actually real Christians I often hear from conservative Christians that when people deconstruct their faith that they were just never real Christians but people don't deconstruct their faith because they were never real Christians we deconstruct our faith because we were  the most Christian of Christians so today I'll be talking about why people who deconstruct their faith were the most Christian of Christians before we jump in be sure to like And subscribe and turn on notifications and let me know what you think about the video in the comments also these videos take a lot of time and energy to make so if you like my content be sure to support me on patreon at patreon.com Mason Mena and if you enjoy my Twitter account you can get a shirt or sticker of your favorite tweet of  mine at Mason mana.com store sometimes people who deconstruct ask me what I wish I could convince conservative Christians of many times they think I would want to convince them that being lgbtq isn't a sin or that hell isn't real while I would like to convince conservative Christians about those things I doubt it would be likely it's hard to convince people who believe the Earth is 6,000 years old much of anything but there is one thing I think many of them could possibly be convinced of and I wish they  accepted so if you are a Conservative Christian watching this video or if you have deconstructed or are deconstructing right now and have doubts about whether you are ever a real Christian I want you to know that people who deconstruct their faith were actually real Christians one of the arguments I hear from conservative Christians especially online about people who deconstruct their faith is that they were never real Christians in the first place but that couldn't be further from the truth those  of us who deconstructed our faith especially those of us who grew up in evangelicalism we're told that there is one thing you must do to become a Christian you must ask Jesus to come into your heart and give your life to him usually this is done by praying what is known as the sinner's prayer which by the way like the word homosexuality before 1946 isn't found anywhere in the Bible I have met thousands of people who have deconstructed over the past number of years and every single one of us at least once prayed for Jesus to come into  our hearts and to give our lives to him the very thing that we were told that we must do to become Christian is the very every person who has now deconstructed once did but then we found out that asking Jesus to come into our heart and giving our lives to him weren't the only things we had to do to be a Christian we then found out we had to produce good fruit to prove our Christian faith to others one of the good fruits we were told was reading our Bible frequently even every day those of us who  deconstructed read our Bibles very frequently I still remember getting my first Bible when I was 10 years old and I remember reading my entire Bible in one year when I was in high school shout out to the people who read the entire Bible before they had their first kiss another good fruit we were told was that we needed to believe the right theology those of us who deconstructed were the creationists and we knew why Calvinism or arminianism was right and why we believed homosexuality was a sin another  good fruit we were told was to attend church again those of us who deconstructed not only attended church on Sundays but we attended youth group as well some of us even carried a bunch of folding chairs at once to impress girls because of how often we attend youth group another good fruit we were told was remaining sexually pure until marriage those of us who deconstructed attempted not to have sex until marriage so that the wedding night could be special for like 10 seconds and even many people who deconstructed after they  were married did in fact not have sex until marriage another good fruit we were told was not to be influenced by anything that was secular those of us who deconstructed actively only watch Christian movies listened to Christian music and avoided all things that were considered secular and that is why many of us still awkwardly nod our heads like we understand Harry Potter references those of us who deconstructed our faith were warned about lukewarm Christians who didn't take their faith seriously  they were the ones who claimed they were Christian but didn't walk the walk the lukewarm Christians were the ones who only occasionally read the Bible and attended church they were the ones who fooled around with their boyfriends and girlfriends and they certainly listened to that Godless Lady Gaga because she's Catholic not because she's an atheist these lukewarm Christians may or may not have remain Christian but they certainly did not deconstruct because they never constructed much of a Christian faith to  begin with the very reason why those of us who could even deconstruct our faith to begin with is because we once constructed a strong faith we were the ones who asked Jesus into our heart every time there was an alter call we knew all the differences between young Earth creationism and old Earth creationism we were the ones who read our Bibles had the right theology attended church remained sexually pure and avoided all things being secular we were the ones who constructed a strong faith until one day we realized it was  all an illusion I still remember my senior year of high school and figuring out the couple in Song of Songs who had sex weren't married at the beginning of the book it felt like all I had been told about sexual Purity was a lie there are countless stories like this from those of us who deconstructed our faith we didn't deconstruct because we were lukewarm or fake Christians we deconstructed because we had constructed a strong faith and then realized ized what we had been given was all an illusion and then we later found out  that many leaders in the church didn't actually believe and do any of the things that they told us to believe and do while those of us who deconstructed our faith are often told we were never real Christians there are the Jerry fwell jors of the world who explicitly admit they were the fake Christians that those of us who deconstructed are often accused of having Ben while those of us who deconstructed prayed for Jesus to come into our hearts read our Bibles attend ended Church didn't have sex until marriage and avoided all things  secular many of the leaders of our churches rarely read their Bibles were not sexually pure with their wives and some never believed any of what they told us to believe after multiple controversies that ended with Jerry fwell Jr resigning as president of Liberty University he revealed in a Vanity Fair article that he never believed any of the Christian beliefs he claimed while students at Liberty have been kicked out of school for drinking having sex or being lgbtq fwell Jr claimed he never believed any of it  anyway Christian leaders like Jerry fwell Jr prove that we didn't deconstruct because we were fake Christians most people don't deconstruct their faith because the church didn't teach them about Jesus but because the church didn't live like Jesus we found out that all we had been told was an illusion and we started to break down and learn what was true and what was a lie about Christianity it reminds me when Caitlyn Stout once said folks who deconstruct evangelicalism aren't dropouts they're graduates we graduated  evangelicalism that is why we deconstruct not because we were never real Christians so if you are a Conservative Christian and you're still watching this and props to you for making it this far you can believe those of us who deconstructed are wrong about not believing homosexuality is a sin or that hell is real you shouldn't but you can but what I pray is that you realize that those of us who deconstructed were real Christians all of the things you may think make someone a real Christian we believed and did those very things we  deconstructed precisely because we were real Christians not because we were fake Christians thank you for watching if you enjoyed this video be sure

C201	https://youtu.be/xHGmU4ITXdo?si=1uXI_qsWsXWdROf0	[Applause] ending sexual violence against women has become a national priority and we are having incredible conversations in the media and classrooms and boardrooms and at dinner tables around the United States that are creating a climate truly galvanized for change but while the visibility surrounding the issue has increased the violence itself has not ended and what that tells me is we need to move beyond visibility and generate a solution the in sexual violence for all people what that demands is truly understanding the scope  of the problem and appreciating who is at the greatest risk of experiencing sexual violence in our country we have a dominant narrative of who the sexual assault survivor is and that narrative is impacted by the media like the women of the times up movement Dateline CNN The Today Show and of course by storylines on Law & Order SVU these things combined with our personal experiences and social ideas about violence and who can experience it converge to create a rather singular idea of who the sexual assault survivor  is and I imagine that if we compared notes we'd come up with a pretty similar image that that person would definitely be female likely white probably under 40 typically thin and always straight and this narrative holds a surprising amount of power as it impacts our legislation how we build programming how we spend money and our social sympathies towards survivors most simply this narrative is of the white female straight survivor and to be clear this narrative isn't wrong it's real and it's important but  it is incomplete it is incomplete because it does not represent the experiences and stories of people at the greatest risk of experiencing sexual violence the LGBTQ community the data we have surrounding assault against LGBTQ people is alarming we know that 44% of lesbians will be raped experience physical violence or stalking by the hands of an intimate partner compared to 35% of straight women we know that gay and bisexual men are both twice as likely as straight men to experience sexual harassment and that one in two by  women will be raped in their life and one in two people who identify as transgender will experience sexual violence and I want to repeat those last two statistics because they are so important that one into by women and one into trans folks will experience sexual violence at least one time in their life that is 50% and that number is not just alarming it is unacceptable and because sexual orientation and gender identity do not live in silos and we are complex beings with multiple identities we necessarily have to take an  intersectional lens to this issue and when we do we see that LGBTQ people of color are more likely to experience all forms of violence including sexual violence and that LGBTQ people or unstable housed have a disability are imprisoned or do sex work or at an exponentially greater risk now I suggested that our cultural narrative is incomplete because it does not reflect those experiences and stories but maybe I need to pause and take a step further back because maybe the problem begins before this narrative  is reinforced to the exclusion of the LGBTQ community maybe the problem begins before the narrative is written maybe it's written in a different language a language that doesn't translate to the queer community communities of color or anyone who shares a marginalized identity so bear with me have you ever traveled abroad or tried to communicate to somebody in a different language it's just you and them alone in a room there's no Google Translate or pen and paper I think we can all remember those  feelings of confusion and maybe irritation but imagine it's an emergency and it's only you and that other person alone in the room you repeat what you need over and over as your voice grows louder and they look back at you with a blank stare so you start to scramble to find a different way to communicate but your heart beats faster that tension rises and you start choking on those feelings of confusion anxiety fear desperation and hopelessness that is what a queer survivor of sexual violence faces when confronting systems  institutions and people that do not speak their language my work and my passion is serving queer survivors of sexual violence by day I run the empower program which is the first program in the nation designed specifically to meet the needs of LGBTQ survivors of sexual violence the empower program its staff and patients truly give me life by night I'm a clinical psychologist of the private practice specializing in LGBT mental health and trauma so over the course of my career I've had the privilege of sharing in the  healing journey of hundreds of career survivors of sexual violence and their stories are unique and complex and punctuated by resilience but today I'm going to share just a small part of one person's story a person I'm gonna call reign reign was a queer trans woman of color in her early 20s that moved to Chicago because Chicago offered this queer utopia this opportunity to go by her pronouns her chose a name and be surrounded by people that not only validated her identities but shared them rain came to see me about a year after  moving presenting with high levels of anxiety and our work together it became clear that she was experiencing significant violence in her intimate relationship reigns liban partner would threaten to out her at work repeatedly said hurtful and harmful things about her body and again over and over told her that no one would ever love her because she was trans all of this was a means to manipulate force and coerce rain into sex sex that for her was never consensual but rain ever called these experiences rape or sexual assault  because they were normalized by friends who shared similar experiences and invalidated by her family that loved this partner and couldn't imagine them causing this much harm so the work rein and I did centered on consent safety planning around the violence and finding ways just to help her make it through the day and we were making real progress that was until rain got a new job that required her to take the train to work she used to tell me that day after day on that train people would say horrible  transphobic things about her body or would touch her inappropriately I remember her so clearly telling me when I am on that train my body doesn't belong to me it belongs to them and then rein was raped at a party she woke up not remembering exactly what happened but knew something in her body did not feel right so like the good survivor she went to the hospital for a rape kit and when she checked in the receptionist was unable to gather her pronouns or chose a name and the medical record and what that meant is when she  was called back when it was her turn she was called by her dead name her dead name is the male name assigned at birth the name that doesn't fit for who she is the name that invalidates every core of her being the name that causes her harm but rain swallowed that pain mustered the courage and went back to the exam room where she crawled on the table next to that scratchy gown she looked down at her risk to the medical ID bracelet that so boldly pronounced her dead name yet another reminder of her invisibility and  a system designed to protect and support survivors and then rain overheard the nurse say we have a code are in exam room 3 he wants to do a rape kit so we have to call the police but before we do does anyone know how to do a rape kit on him you know on someone like him and with that rains anxiety mounted so high she panicked and fled the emergency room without the care she not only needed but deserved and was her right Raines friends and family did not speak her language when they didn't understand the  sexual abuse in her relationship the medical system literally did not speak her language when they were unable to capture her pronouns or chose a name and electronic medical record and the nurse certainly didn't speak her language when the nurse continued to misgender her and felt unprepared to do a trans confident rape kit rain was pleading and begging for help from systems institutions and people that did not speak her language they spoke the language of the white straight female survivor I hope that  rain story demonstrates that the language we have that dictates our programming and how we talk to and about survivors is not just incomplete and insufficient but it causes harm so in order to end sexual violence for all people we need to learn rain's language learning this language matters because sexual violence is expensive it's expensive too survivors who experience physical and mental health consequences might lose their job being able to pay for rent or have to drop out of school sexual violence is expensive to families who  can feel torn apart children that can go unnoticed and partners that can go neglected and if that's not enough sexual violence is expensive to society the CDC estimates that it costs one hundred twenty two thousand four hundred and sixty one dollars to provide the lifetime care for a single survivor that equates the three point one trillion dollars learning this new language matters because we have a real opportunity to create a solution that is not just equal but as equitable and unfortunately in this nation we have a  history of generating solutions that are incomplete insufficient and caused harm whether that is the Emancipation Proclamation the way we have treated indigenous people or the Second Amendment these solutions were designed to create an equal playing field but what they did was leave the playing field filled with landmines if we do not address this issue in its entirety will be an issue that rages into perpetuity in the same way that gun violence and racism do learning this new language matters because it is the foundation of  that complete solution and in the words of Audrey Lord there is no thing as a single issue struggle because we do not live single issue lives and reign like every career survivor of sexual violence I have ever worked with experienced multiple traumas because remember that sexual violence is violence and so too is the homophobia biphobia transphobia toxic masculinity to sexism ableism heteronormativity classism races and community violence that queer people face everyday learning this new language  is tough and it requires an investment and I can understand that that list of isms that I just shared might be new and foreign to some people and that's okay because like with learning any new language there will be terms you don't know so I implore you to ask me or look it up for yourself because it is that curiosity which drives us forward towards the complete solution we need and now I know that today we're not going to generate that complete solution or learn this new language in its entirety  so my hope is to leave you with action steps that every person can do and better yet every person has a responsibility to do it's three simple steps the first step is something we already know something we were taught by our parents or a preschool teachers and that is to keep our hands and our feet to ourselves whether you are four fourteen forty gay or straight this rule applies to you without exception because the first step in ending sexual violence is respecting each other's bodies and if we can remember that there is no limit  to the success and progress of our nation step two is reimagining the golden rule the Golden Rule isn't just to treat others how we want to be treated it is also to treat others how they want to be treated we need to challenge our own assumptions that we have about the queer community and that starts with assuming that everybody is straight and cisgender and bi cisgender I mean sex assigned at birth matching gender identity so whether we're here talking about survivors the barista at Starbucks or our family or friends straight and  cisgender is not and cannot be the norm reimagining the Golden Rule means asking people their pronouns and using them it means introducing ourselves with our own whether we're a cocktail party corporate function or community space hi I'm Paige Baker Braxton and I use she/her pronouns I promise the more you practice the easier it gets and reimagining the golden rule means respecting other people's autonomy and choice over how they present what they want to be called and who they love and the third step is  engaging an ally ship with the community of queer survivors and what that looks like is engaging in warfare against people and institutions that cause harm it means getting in the trenches and fighting alongside the queer and trans people of color already doing this movement work and uplifting and centering their voices means voting for elected officials that support queer and trans rights and tangible steps to ending sexual violence and engaging in allies ship with the community of queer survivors means renewing  nation's commitment to never leaving a person behind sexual violence is not about sex it is about power and control and the people in this audience have the power and control to be forces of action and vehicles have changed in ending this public health crisis that is sexual violence and to all the survivors in the audience your stories are real and important and you are believed and know that I stand with you today and health and support and pride and empower thank you [Applause] [Music] you [Music] 	Liberal			Conservative	35
C222	https://youtu.be/fCSMVRwPuy8?si=PcMyYvGQulj2oJ8K	Sam Cedar Emma vigland on the majority report want to welcome back to the program Jeet here National Affairs correspondent for the nation magazine G thanks so much for joining us oh always a pleasure um I got a first question for you uh you asked this question I think on Monday in a piece at the nation will um will Benjamin Netanyahu drag America into a big Middle Eastern War it is is uh a tribute to you that this uh question has nearly been answered uh just four days later um what well I think  um he's definitely trying you got to give BB credit right he's making the effort um I actually think it's a very interesting thing that's going on right now because um both um the United States and Iran do not want a big Regional War H nor nor do the um Arab autocracies that are aligned with the United States um and so what you're basically seeing is this very weird kabuki dance of uh people like you know trying to respond to various Israeli provocations um uh and taking things to the limit of War but not war there's a  lot of kind of very curious calibration that's uh that's been going on um uh and this actually I mean to give credit where credits do uh George W bush by uh his idiotic decision to EV invade Iraq um created a situation uh where um Iraq is very friendly to Iran and uh now acts as a kind of uh uh back Channel or goet between the United States and Iran so uh even before the um uh last Saturday's bombings uh the US and Iranians were talking and basically setting out the parameters for Iran's response um and  that has continued that the US is like you know uh basically trying to uh choreograph um this wrestling match so that you know both sides can get in their swipes uh without it actually being a situation where um you know we get World War I um how how long that can continue that's an open question right I mean we're we're walking on thin ice essentially but it is when you step back and just sort of contemplate this idea that in this incredibly volatile region everyone there like this is like you got  your best friend who's like trying to drag you into all sorts of fights but even the people he's trying to pick fights with are like no not interested it's just sort of weird I mean is it I mean this is like we're we're like I mean aside from like the horrors associated with this when you step back and you look at this this is a very very strange Dynamic and one which I don't I I I can't find at least within modern history any type of analogy to this um actually I think the analogy would be in um the  before the first world war which might not be the reassurance that you need uh but before the first world war both the um the Russians and the uh austr hungarians and the the Germans had various proxies in the Balkans um as did Britain and uh France and they were using these proxies to carry out battles and basically uh you know like uh um as these uh uh Bulan proxies started to carry out uh horrific terrorist and assassination attacks the great Powers got dragged into war because uh what's in the interest of the small power is to  get the big power to join them in their battle and fight their fight for them uh and that's not necessarily an interest of the big Power although they want to show like they want to have this alliance system so I think that is the worrying precedent that you could have a situation um I also also sort of remember that Warner Brothers cartoon with the two dogs one of which is a very tough guy and the other is a little dog that follows him around and keeps getting to fights knowing that the big dog will uh join him in his fight uh and  that is basically the American Israeli relationship you can also I think draw uh some comparison to the final years of South Africa's apartheid regime where they were beginning conflicts uh was Angola zimb way um you know you can see a bit of the parallels of a of a regime of this kind being unsustainable and collapsing upon itself but of course the American Israel relationship is so unique given the fact that we it's the only country that has this Powerhouse domestic lobbying organization in APAC  with tens of millions of dollars that has been quite effective in basically buying our government in this in this way so much so that I I mean Joe Biden still has not made any substantive action despite some rhetorical shifts in funding Israel and supporting it diplomatically including what we saw yesterday at the United Nations vetoing that Palestinian statehood uh resolution yeah no the South African analogy is I think exactly on point and it's partially a matter of like they want there's two factors at work one is  the personal survival of Benjamin Netanyahu uh where you know like he knows like if there's no war he's done and so like if he's being pressured to like um ease up on Gaza he has to have another War uh but beyond Netanyahu and I I think we should never just blame Netanyahu there's the Israeli political system and the instincts of that political system have always been to like talk about anything other than the Palestinians that's to say like never get to a position where you actually have to negotiate a two-state solution  um and the theory that they've always had is there's always some other Factor whether it's Saddam Hussein or the Iranians that are the real problem I mean this is like um right you might recall right after October 7th there were like these articles in the was in the Wall Street Journal and elsewhere uh making the Absurd argument that this was like uh basically an Iranian plot that the Iranians had caused October 7 and it's because they would rather fight like a big war with Iran which is a state and where you know you can like  bomb things then actually grapple with the real unsolvable dilemma that they have um this they occupy these uh population that will you know like uh refuses their rule so so there's a kind of distraction uh effect going on but it's also about galvanizing Western support right because this this supplemental which I know will talk about this Aid to Israel has been kind of just sitting there and um the at a time when public opinion in the west you know for the base of the democratic party here a majority of  people Biden's voter base are outraged by this and want us to change policy on Israel but and I'm sure Netanyahu saw that and so this like original strike on the consulate into in in Syria killing this top Iranian General appears to me as a very obvious attempt for him to Galvanize Western Military Support if the threat of Iran looms as public opinion was beginning to change on this gen on the support for this genocide yeah no I think that is the rationale and the logic although I have to say like if we get into a large war and  there are like a large number of American uh uh soldiers dying because of a war that Israel started uh you know like public opinion which is already souring on Israel like you know it's GNA go to a whole new place yeah I agree with that I mean did you see this thing in the uh supposedly in the times uh where supposedly Israel was surprised that Iran took issue with this um with I'm not joking they said they didn't see as a provocative action they didn't see it as a provocative action I mean the  what what is stunning to me is like the it there I have seen no outside of like all the speculation you talked about in the first days after October 7th I have seen no reporting whatsoever and and and and plenty of reports to the to the contrary that Iran was involved in the planning of of October 7th or was even aware of it beforehand I mean that seems to be the consensus and yet here they are in the midst of uh this assault on Gaza which is supposedly according to them existential they're just like side  bombing uh you know Syria and Iran like just we didn't even think that anybody would even notice like what what who is this for it feels to me like this stuff is now just for deluded people to have something to hang on to do you know what I mean like it's not convincing anybody absolutely yeah and I want to just underscore that like the only people that were saying that the Iranians had for knowledge uh was basically the Wall Street Journal and a few other right-wing Outlets that were clearly being fed information um from  Israeli intelligence but the consensus of American intelligence is the exact opposite that um not only were the Iranians not involved with October 7th they were really taken by surprise uh by it and that actually explains a lot of their behavior of both um Iran and Hezbollah afterwards where they've been really trying to like you know have hands off they don't want to get involved with a fight that they did not um uh know about and uh have any role in uh so I I actually think uh yeah who who is this for I mean like it is based on  the especially based on yeah appealing to that hardcore base and as a says galvanizing Western opinion like there is a sort of you know if you can have a war with Iran you you can um uh get that but it's also based on the very practical reality that Geor uh Joe Biden has given them a blank check and has always said you know you have Ironclad support there are no red lines so if you have someone who's like you know willing to back you up all the way let's say you're like a rich kid and you have a  Daddy who like you know every time you crash a car or you know you get into a bar fight he'll always bail you out right uh lawyers always send Lawyers Guns and Money then then you're going to act that way right this is the spoil literally did that with his kid but anyway yeah yeah yeah well and with his dogs I mean this is actually like Biden's way of uh relating to uh um people the the irony is too is that I feel like you know well I think Netanyahu knows that he needs to have these ongoing dramas to m maintain  his position you know to to not get booted out of office I think on some level like there has to be some measure of drama I also can't help I mean I think in I think that there is uh and while I agree with you you know Netanyahu is is more symptomatic of a problem that exists in the Israeli body uh um uh uh body politic as opposed to being sort of uh some outlier I don't think he is at all um but I do think that this is another case and I feel like this happened during the Bush Administration as well in fact that's  what I I I would imagine there was like some uh dissent as to whether um Israel should have unilaterally pulled out of of of Gaza and just converted it into essentially a a ghetto an open air prison or whatever it is you want to however you want to characterize it um but that there is no ballast of which the Israeli Administration can use the US government it feels like as a way of like justifying tapping the breaks at any point um I mean maybe this is happening internally you know when uh you know you  got even like Ben gavier I think it was who said like the attack on Iran our retaliation for Iran's retaliation was was weak and whatnot I mean obviously they have their incentive structure but nobody can credibly say like the us is going to cut off Aid if we do anything different I mean like that's the thing they can't even say that no absolutely they can't say that no Biden has given them a blank check and this is what you get and on the Netanyahu point I mean absolutely his personal survival rests  on World War but if you actually look at like you know the reporting on what's going on in the war cabinet uh you know the so-called moderates um like Gant like they're actually like more eager for a war with irq than Netanyahu is so I think structurally it is like the Israeli State um basically the war in Gaza has gone very badly I mean like if you think about it like it's been six months and like Kamas is still there and they haven't recovered the hostages they've done horrific horrific things uh and yes  of course if you have a modern Army you can kill a lot of civilians but they have not achieved any of their military goals um and nor can they I mean they have no real like logical military goals there uh so so so they need another Avenue for showing military prowess uh and then Joe Biden has you know like he said You know here are the car keys go wreck another car exactly um what what do you make of the vetoing of uh the UN resolution for full membership for Palestine the the US excuse on this was like well we do uh  support a Palestinian state but we think it should be negotiated between the parties which essentially means they shouldn't be able to have one unless Israel gives them permission to which as far as I can tell there were really no multi-party negotiations well let's put it this way not everybody was at the table uh when Israel itself got its mandate from the UN MH yeah no absolutely I mean like um well I mean there's a couple of things one is I I want to uh it's a little bit interesting that before the  vote the US was like going to like all the uh countries on the council and uh saying like you know let's not bring this up can can you do us a favor you know like uh and it's because they didn't want to have the vote and they didn't want to come out to be seen as against a Palestinian State and I think that really shows the kind of game that's played here which is that the idea of a two-state solution a Palestinian state is basically used as a rhetorical lip service like it's something you pay tribute to but you  never actually act on and you never actually do um and I think it's actually interesting that uh the um uh countries that they were going to uh trying to say like you know like let's not bring this to a vote uh they didn't listen to the United States the US has zero credibility on the international stage on this uh not just like in the global South but like you know like among tradition allies in in Europe and Asia yeah that I think is really the telling thing this is if you wanted to take a temperature and see  where the rest of the world is relative uh to their uh listening to the US two extensions is the best that the US could do um and I think that is UK and Switzerland very very telling uh frankly that's right yeah that's right and then I mean of course the UK are the you know lap dogs of America so that's uh not surprising but uh uh yeah no I I I I the um this is really an example of American exceptionalism and it goes back to like Emma's point about you know the the immense power of the Israeli Lobby uh  and the fact that the US has carved out um a very special position for Israel which they give to no other country and the fact that even among that you know American exceptionalism Joe Biden is not an outlier to even that like he does not even have the self-respect of a you know bush senior or a Clinton or an Obama or a Reagan who all at particular points said to Israel enough is enough like Joe Biden does not have that in him uh and that's what makes this a very scary moment yeah let let's talk a little bit  about um the sort of I guess the the some of the politics around this like it it seems now that the majority of Democrats um um in a significant majority are against you know this unconditional support uh to Israel and there uh you know prior to this exchange with Iran it seemed like there was at least some building momentum to condition Aid um we'll talk a little bit about the supplemental that's winding its way through but um I was really struck by the protest that we saw I guess it was yesterday uh in at Columbia  University um because it it does remind me we've mentioned uh you know South Africa it reminds me of when I was in college when we were having this big um uh fight to divest from South Africa and and Rollin Reagan was like you know constructive engagement sort of made up a a term for this um but there were hundreds I mean there were a lot of students on that campus and they brought in a bunch of cops to arrest them apparently uh I've learned from Twitter that Colombia is very very uh particular  about their lawns in their in their quad there apparently and their gate situation which they closed to because of all these outside agitators you know but this is this is like the these were very peaceful protest I mean there that's the thing that really struck me they're bringing in hundreds of cops to arrest just a Frid a Thursday afternoon sitting on the quad protest it was pretty crazy well I mean the most remarkable thing is you know there the administration that called it in and the NYPD in their statement said well you  know these were peaceful protesters and we didn't actually see anything you know that was going on here uh but we were called in right like like he so so the administration of Columbia University is officially like more like let's crackheads than the NYPD uh and I just to be clear with people this is how they did it they basically voked the rights of students to hang out on the quad essentially uh on this day so they they it was trespassing that they were arrested for uh and that's yeah it's an  amazing thing it's an amazing thing and and particularly since you know we have a long history of this going back to the Vietnam War and the South African protest where you know like it's actually a very bad thing for a university president to like call in the cops on protesters that's a good way to lose your legitimacy uh with faculty and with students uh but I mean University pre uh presidents are facing pressure from another end uh one is political they're being dragged before Congress in these kind of show trials you know like  to say like what are you doing to fight anti-Semitism uh but also from the donor class and um uh um I I saw really interesting analysis of this which is that the universities are um being hit on two pressure points uh one is from the donor class which includes a lot of people that are you know either pro-israel or just Pro status quo quo they don't like protest they don't like disruption uh and then they have the students um uh which are politically very different uh and increasingly um you know like International um I this is  one way American universities like continue to go that they get students from all over the world and therefore are like you know like far like more Progressive on this uh than the than the donors and but the university needs both for income right like they need the student tuition and they need the donors uh to uh give um you know uh grants and alumni funding uh so um basically it's like like which side are you on question and a lot of University Prof uh administrations are well you know the donors they they write the big checks  you know like that is the side that they're on and I think that's a it's a pretty grave mistake well I mean look you're you're going to get phone calls from donor owners you you're not getting calls from prospective um uh students who they are yet they're also not listening to their the teachers on their campuses right that's the other thing where the administrators are basically as you're saying G responsive to the the donor class and the big money donor specifically at these Elite universities  and you have the professors who are engaging with these topics and want to preserve uh free expression on campuses the exact place where you know you should be having these discussions this is what liberal educa education is ostensibly supposed to be for and the administrators are actively um and including the Colombia uh president who went in front of Congress and did not provide really any defense for her student body or the academic freedom at the institution um and who criticized professors at her own University uh you  know like slandered like you know uh professors there which is like a really shocking thing um yeah yeah know I think that the university presidents are in UNT tenable position um and to go back to this South African example the um I think it was um uh GMAT in um the father of the actor who's the president of Y yeah yeah who you know was a former Major League Baseball commissioner as well but he was also I did not know that actually yeah yeah yeah yeah he called in the cops on South African protesters um and  that was basically the end of his like reain as president like he lost huge amount of legitimacy um and you know like did not have faculty support uh and even among the donor class like it is the big donors that are for this but like you know there's a lot of medium level donors you know who are just like normal liberal Democrats and they're seeing this stuff and they're not liking it so so yeah yeah I just think uh um I mean it really shows you you know in Stark relief um you know like uh the power centers um uh where the power is  and how much power is it odd with Democratic sentiment it's going to be interesting too to see how um what trajectory this sends this generation on in terms of its politics um it's I think you made that point on um on Twitter that it's you know sort of like making clear whose toes are where and and whose toes are being stepped on yeah no no I mean it's something I I think about a lot I mean you know we obviously have the example of the 60s um but it's also the case and a lot of this has a racial Dimension as well I mean a  lot of the sort of changes in the University are you get um you know this cohort that are immigrants people of color often the first of their family to go to university and um and you know like the Val Doran at um uh University of South Carolina you know who was denied you know like a top student Val USC in California California yeah uh who's not allowed to speak because of uh her Pro Palestine sentiment so so so you're gonna get these people who are you know traditionally you want to integrate them  into the American Elite you want to like you know like like make these people you know your next generation of leaders and but but they're learning you know like like like what the contradictions of Power are in America um and and yeah it's a huge alienating effect um yeah I'm hoping it doesn't depoliticize people but you know like you know sends them in the right direction yeah I have a feeling this is not going to depoliticize people in the way that maybe some some element of people coming out of the 60s were depoliticized yeah  um I mean it's not as broad-based as what was going on with that generation there was a lot more there was a lot of different factors I think uh involved in that that um aren't here in the same way and frankly I think ultimately you know the odd thing is is that there is pretty to the extent that there is a silent majority um they are probably in agreement with those protesters uh oddly enough they may not be as motivated they may not you know it may not be as high on their agenda but if they were forced  to decide I think it's pretty close uh certainly the the the majority of American public now is just sort of like this is this is too much um the what's going on 	Liberal			Center	36

C278	https://youtu.be/_E7siFPHDqs?si=CwYUCSq3kAbbcqIA	hey how you doing this is Adam post publisher of more than a thousand comic books and marketing expert covering Hollywood panics streamers confirm no one is watching or re-watching hundreds of woke TV shows let's get into the story before we do please be sure you are subscribed to the channel click the bell for notifications give me a thumbs up I really appreciate you guys coming from Breitbart data confirms no one's watching hundreds of woke streaming shows and from variety streaming viewership data shows steep drop off  after top Originals so with all of the millions and it's really not Millions it's billions of dollars these streaming services are spending on new shows outside of a few top shows no one's watching them and then even with the top shows people don't tend to re-watch those shows like they do classic shows there are like no new Classics actually being made from Breitbart data confirms no one's watching hundreds of woke streaming shows data revealed by Variety in March confirmed that other than the  top 20 shows pretty much no one is watching any of the woke crap on America's lousy streaming services and this was something that I had the greatest concern for that the streaming services would somehow get control over what we see produced and that it wouldn't really be like a fair Marketplace of ideas where we pay them money every month on a subscription basis they take that Revenue they do whatever they do with it and to eventally say well look as long as we have this Revenue coming in we can do  whatever kind of content we want and you're stuck as a subscriber supporting us until recently we really didn't even see a lot of published data on how successful these individual shows are now we're starting to see more and more of that data but the way these streaming services get away with producing whatever content they want is by giving subscribers no other option than to just accept whatever it is they decide to produce but at the same time there's something not right about the accounting  with these shows because if they produce these shows and they say okay well they have a life of you know two years or 5 years or 10 years and we can work it out so that our cost seems to work and report that cost to shareholders they don't seem to be acknowledging the massive losses that they're actually taking because wait till you see the actual data of all of the shows they're producing very few of them actually get watched and then rewatched so if the shows aren't going to get rewatched what's the value of any of these shows  they're producing the accounting is actually way off and at some point there will be a reckoning for all of this in the meantime we get stuck with a lot of garbage TV shows and things like Cleopatra where they hire a black actress to push an agenda rather than trying to make something that actually fits within reality and people's expectations quote as siries output soar to Historic highs in 2022 with nearly 1,000 original titles released on the major streaming platforms the useless far-left variety reported without ever  explaining why viewership on most Services was concentrated among fewer than two dozen shows do that math for a second 1,000 original titles but most of the actual viewership on the streaming platform is with fewer than two dozen shows two two dozen means 24 it's not a Baker's Dozen it's not even 26 it's 24 shows out of a thousand but they're not necessarily even part of the 1,000 original titles let's go on quote data shows that the top 20 most watched TV seasons on every streaming service other  than Netflix accounted for the vast majority of original series viewership on almost all the major us-based streaming Platforms in 2022 normal people know this already but it's good to see the actual data both the drop off between the top performing shows and the remainder is if anything even more striking Accord to the report Disney plus released 50 Original Series in 2022 and the 10 most popular series captured nearly 80% of original series viewing time the next 10 just over 16% 50 original series can you imagine how  much money they spent on that it's in the billions the 10 most popular got 80% of the viewing and then the next 10 16% so the rest of the 4% of the viewing is represented in the remaining 30 original series literally almost no one watching those Disney Seasons that were not in the top 20 accounted for only about 5% of viewing time other than peacock's 3% that is the worst of all the major streamers the following is by far the most important Revelation the all important rewatchable factor If You're a  Star Trek fan you've seen the original Star Trek episodes several times how many times depends on how much free time you have do you like that show The Office Seinfeld Breaking Bad I could go watch Breaking Bad right now from beginning to end and enjoy this series all over again but these new streaming shows are not producing anything like that that's not only not watchable it's also of course because it's not watchable it's not rewatchable looking again at Disney plus only two of the top 10 Original Series in 2022 reappeared  among the top 10 in the next year the Mandalorian season 2 and limited series Andor and both Star Wars properties the former actually saw its share of viewing time rise year-over-year likely bolstered by the third season's Premiere and that's fine they do a new season and it creates interest in a previous season that's great as long as people are actually interested in watching these series but they're not even if people are watching the top 20 streaming shows Once almost no one goes back to watch  them again they are not producing new Classics so what are Americans actually rewatching pre- Wok shows such as suits friends gry's Anatomy the office Seinfeld Breaking Bad lost the classic television shows that are actually entertaining provocative and offer subtext instead of straight text left-wing lectures gay sex men and dresses that were required to take seriously virtue signaling diversity hires nothing's funny nothing's irreverent nothing's fun instead of offering the pleasure of making us think  we're told what to think it's all garbage Cleopatra is a great example taking a historic figure and making them black just so you can say hey isn't it great we have a black queen is a one-dimensional approach to storytelling representation does not make story The woke people do not understand this story is a relatability for the characters in a situation story has little or nothing to do with looking like the person who's in The Story characters need to face challenges and overcome them or not overcome them when we see oursel in  characters it's because of how they're dealing with situations not because they look like us representation is not storytelling this is like storytelling for the third grade or maybe the fourth grade children understand this the woke people don't and the Netflix's and the Disney plus people and the peacock people just sign off on it and move it along and then people don't watch the shows this is such a disaster waiting to happen when they actually go into the accounting and they realize like look  you can't say that this content is worthwhile if people aren't watching it and then even if people do watch it if they're not going to rewatch it then you have to say you know what this is now worthless because there's no audience for it we produced it some people sort of watched it even their most popular shows just because they watch it once if people are not willing to rewatch it the value of those shows drops precipitously the rejection of all this garbage is costing Hollywood billions and think of  the waste billions of dollars poured into thousands and thousands of hours no one will ever watch it's all ether it's as as if it never existed but the older stuff going all the way back to the 1950s to the 1980s people are still watching through Outlets such as me TV and grit and a perfect example of everything wrong with the entertainment business today remember War of the Roses the 1989 movie that stared Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner they just announced the remake with Olivia Coleman and Benedict cumberbach and as the  author John Noti says here only an industry run by prudish lunatics would think that removing sex appeal from War of the Roses is a good idea what's next Baywatch returns starring lizo Oprah and a transvesti and then JN goes on to point us to better call saw which is a newish show it's not from the 90s it's not from the 80s it was made recently and John points this out this isn't a Facebook post and he's got a lot of good things to say and I suggest you check it out but specifically how he talks about  Gus the way they handled Gus in Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul is the right way to handle a gay character his sexuality has nothing to do with who he is his love for his boyfriend however drives everything and we can all relate to that so gay or not gay you can understand that your love for a significant other is enough to make you want to do things Gus has an actual motivation there's actual story for that actual character and look how much story and how many characters come out of Gus's obsession with wanting to get  revenge but instead of focusing on story instead of focusing on character and Cleopatra was an amazing character could have been an incredible story they focus only on representation and what's the result here's the result from The Daily Mail Netflix's Queen Cleopatra is panned by viewers as it receives a Rotten Tomato score of just 1% amid blackwashing Row the documentary which is part of the African queen series is an exploration of the rise and fall of the last pharaoh of Egypt and was released on May 10th it discusses issues  such as her relationships and Heritage which is a subject of debate as well as her political work and this idea of blackwashing Cleopatra has got Netflix being sued for $2 billion by Egyptians for distorting the image of Cleopatra the show has been subject to blackwashing claims after a black actress was cast in a lead role despite historical records showing she was Macedonian Greek after 4 days on Rotten Tomatoes Queen Cleopatra has been given just 1% audience rating reportedly the worst ever documented according to  Forbes forb said fans usually rate things higher than critics even bad shows and the point being a 1% audience score seems to borderline mathematically be impossible even with the controversy the film is attracted producer Jen pinkin Smith says she wanted to tell the story of Cleopatra because quote we don't often get to see or hear stories about black queens so just make a fictional black queen don't fictionalize a Macedonian Greek Queen in the trailer which was released in April it claims that Cleopatra was black with curly hair  one historian asserts in the preview I remember my grandmother saying to me I don't care what they tell you in school Cleopatra was black that's a good way to site a reference just point at your grandmother my grandmother said some things that today would be considered to be offensive but I'm not going to get into it that said I'm not going to make her a historical expert she was just my grandma an Egyptian lawyer has followed a case with the country's public prosecutor demanding that netlix be shut  down cairo's former Antiquities Minister zahi howas condemned the documentary as complete completely fake they said Cleopatra was Greek meaning that she was light-skinned not black this is also something to consider there is more than one culture in the world there is more than one race in the world we know this we should respect other people's cultures to the extent that it's possible to do that so for Netflix to not direct Jada pinket Smith to cooperate with the Egyptian government doesn't seem like that makes a lot of  sense not very respectful of other cultures the Antiquities Minister said quot Cleopatra was Greek meaning that she was light-skinned not black zachi said the only rulers of Egypt known to have been black were the kushite kings of the 25th Dynasty he said Netflix is trying to provoke Confusion by spreading false and deceptive facts that the origin of the Egyptian civilization is black well I mean they would do that for political reasons and I'm sure he's quite right about that he alleged that the show featured content that violated  Egypt's media laws and accused Netflix of trying to promote the Afrocentric thinking which include slogans and writing aimed at distorting and erasing the Egyptian identity leap Patra was famously played by white English actress Elizabeth Taylor opposite Richard Burton as Mark Anthony in the historical Epic from 1963 three years ago plans for a new movie about the queen starring Israeli actress gal gdat sparked a backlash from people insisting the role should go to an Egyptian or African actress gal defended the decision saying  we were looking for a Macedonian actress that could fit Cleopatra she wasn't there and I was very passionate about Cleopatra the two-minute official trailer uploaded on April 12th sparked so much controversy that Netflix was forced to turn comments off one author tweeted for the nth time the Egyptian Queen Cleopatra was not an Egyptian she was Greek Cleopatra I 7th was white of Macedonian descent likewise all the ptoi rulers who lived in Egypt another added Netflix is yet again blackwashing a historical white character this time  it's Queen Cleopatra that is transformed into a black woman despite that we know she was white of mass Onan Greek descent so was all the rulers of the ptoi dynasty another user commented quote blackwashing a Greek Queen proves the obsession with white women and this wouldn't help stopping racism at all from Yahoo finance worst show ever Queen cleia Patra debuts to a miserable 20.2 million streaming hours 2% Rotten Tomatoes audience score entertainment really is a hit business in publishing we know that we might publish 10 things  and one thing that we publish is a hit a couple of things or break evens and a lot of the other things are losses that's very normal it's also very normal for entertainment not every show is going to hit but it shouldn't be that no shows hit and it shouldn't be that these shows have such a common theme of trying to push ideology instead of give you good characters and give you story that you can get excited about if none of the new shows literally basically none of the new shows are successful to the  extent that people aren't interested in rewatching them again and again and again what does that tell you I mean a thousand new shows in 2022 you would think at least five or 10 of them literally five or 10 out of a thousand could become Classics could become shows that people would want to see again and again but they're not the concern for storytelling the concern for characterization the concern for making people passionate or think about or talk about a story people will talk about Queen Cleopatra people will talk about  some of these woke shows to say how offensive and stupid they are how unrealistic they are not because they get an idea from a show or make them think about their own life or their own relationships that's what Star Trek did that's what the office did that's what Breaking Bad did it doesn't matter what the races of the characters it matters that the story is good it matters that the characters are relatable and interesting and if the new shows can't compete with the old shows then there is no future for this kind of entertainment  let me know what you think about all this in the comments below always love to see your ideas please be sure you are subscribed to the channel

C292	https://youtu.be/sRNhJGeZ57Q?si=Rbnx-uBwbsAEGr5m	[Music] here it is the new home of Harborside San Jose is a 10,000 sqt former Bakery I'm in California where recreational marijuana use May soon be legal to meet weed Tycoon Steve D'Angelo at the site of what will soon become the world's biggest marijuana dispensary did you ever think that you'd like one day have like a Best Buy siiz retail facility like if this is a place where cannabis lives now like did you ever think it would live in a place like this yeah you know I've I've always imagined this from the time was about 15  years old uh what's what surprised me is how long it's taken us to get here there's nothing more American than what's happening with cannabis now man you know cannabis stayed the same for like 8,000 years basically there was very little change in cannabis and the product right then it collided with American Ingenuity uh nothing's ever going to be the same and we're now you know talking about how the Pie Gets diced up and you know whose livelihood is going to be effective in a positive and possibly a negative way so it starts  becoming very very serious it's about people being able to pay their mortgage and some really keeping the farm you know what I mean keeping the farm keeping the [Applause] [Music] [Music] Farm California supplies up to 80% of all the weed in the US and the Emerald Triangle a remote free County region north of San Francisco is C weeds epicenter producing an estimated 4 to7 billion doar of marijuana a year it all started in the' 60s the first plants were sewn by hippies who migrated from San Francisco and Beyond into the hills  to live private lives off the land and illegally grow weed while the Cannabis became famous and their numbers grew The Growers remained a hidden and Ultra secretive community in 1996 California passed proposition 215 making it the first state to legalize medical marijuana and allowing Farmers to grow small numbers of plants legally for the first time while some Farmers embraced medical growing others continued to grow illegally now California looks set to move beyond the restrictions of medical  legalization to full recreational legalization sounds like great news but the market will be open to Big pocketed investors and that could result in gargantuan weed factories putting small cannabis Farmers out of business will California's full legalization end up shutting independent Growers out of the very culture they [Music] created oh Another Day in Paradise good morning ladies smells like OG I'm in the hills of mesino County to meet Casey O'Neal a third generation HT farmer who's hoping he and his fellow  ganja Growers won't lose their foothold in what might become the biggest marijuana Market on the planet you know I grow very specific types of strains to call them the thunderbucket face punch uh they have very wait what do you call it thunder bucket face punch very strong very heavy this is the land I was born and raised on in the early early days days it was it was really rough they hauled water from town they had no money and then one of the neighbors ke my grandpa in to the magic that was grown in the woods and we  started to realize like canvis was a potential so this has been my home my whole life except for when I went to college yeah and then as I came of age and it became my farm and so over time it has developed into my livelihood my office my reality and so you know to be able to live and farm on the place that I was born and raised on is a is a powerful thing we got this guys we got this yep so you can see that we've got these kale plants that are kind of growing up and the Cannabis is getting bigger so what  we're going to do is we're going to clear back the kale first you kind of make a little bunch and sometimes we'll we'll bundle them I like to just throw it in the tub rather than bundling it but it's kind of you know f with proclivities and so is it common to grow vegetables that you eat right next to cannabis like this we've been doing some surveys uh 40% of our small cannabis Farms cultivate uh other food crops for market and 75% of our Farms cultivate food crops for personal consumption without  cannabis I would not grow production vegetables at all the work is too hard the pay is too little this is part of a system that helps make small farms work our entire reality especially here in the triangle is supported fundamentally by cannabis dollars Timber went out a long time ago fishing went out a long time ago this is the Fallout of an industrial Timber regime and this land has been used for industrial practices in the past and and then sort of relegated to the hippies and and we have been able to breathe life back into it  and create these microscale homesteads these self-supporting Farms we didn't do this because it was a job we did it because it was a way of life and cannabis was part of that do you think that this way of life is in Jeopardy yes I looked at the future of Regulation and I said I'm not going to survive and when the thing goes into legitimacy the idea that we would be denied the right to participate in it it would be a great tragedy it comes back to advocacy and being part of the democratic process because there's a  river of corporate money heading our way from a variety of different corporate interests who would love to see the thing develop under a commodity corporate perspective that doesn't include us and so they try to typ cast us as Criminal and so to be able to represent myself and say I'm not some nameless faceless criminal I'm me this is what I do and cannabis is part of it and it should be allowed to be changes the dynamic the number one question I get outside the area is well how quickly can you scale  yeah and my response is by definition craft does not scale I can't there's an estimated 53,000 small farms in California that grow cannabis and the question is will we be surfs producing things for conglomerates or will be will we be specialized micro craft scale Farms see you guys are all sort of banding together as cannabis Farmers to sort of make sure or like hope that the regulations that come out when legalization happens in 2016 carves out a niche for you guys being able to sort of stand for that has been both very  difficult but very invigorating it's like we're people didn't end up out here in the Hills because they were public people they ended up out here because they really liked their privacy and so dragging it into the public has been very difficult and and trying and it's hard but in a sense you think that's what you have to do to survive totally and that's why the more effective we are at banding together and representing ourselves as business owners as Crafts People the more of us will make it today Casey is hosting a recruitment  meeting for the emerald growers association a lobbying group he chairs he wants to unite local cannabis farmers and business owners to influence lawmakers in Sacramento and swing the coming marijuana legalization in their favor has the co-op on one side I'm going to do a a legislative update I'll talk about what's been going on in the state legislature it's been pretty hectic there's going to be compromises that we're not going to like but there's going to be lots of stuff that we really needed to happen that'll be there and  you know at this point I'm confident that we are making our voices heard enough to carve out the things that we absolutely must have so we're holding these barbecues and these workshops and we're getting the experts together and we're figuring out how do we help our Farms make the transition cuz nobody's compliant I'm not compliant none of our Farms are compliant right now but we've never had the opportunity to know what compliance is and that's so what it is can we do individually or as Farms to  make this thing go forward communicate with everybody join EG come to Sacramento talk to your people that are Eastward win the hearts and minds I think you know that we all have to take that step to join the co-op and work together we can't all just you know hide and do our own thing if we want to survive the thing is we keep telling our story that's the whole point this is you know families this is you know lots of people are just making a simple living which is like the American dream the family farm  with an honest product really they call it criminal but we know it's the most honest product you can produce because it it's beautiful it's healing and uh it's magic it comes back to we were really successful at creating this Mystique nobody knows anything about us they have all these default positions about us you guys are all like criminals and pillagers right and us coming and being like ah this is who we are they're like oh you guys are a bunch of hippies okay cool it feels like a you know a  really Monumental shift is happening and and we're shoving hard can we eat now while Casey has successfully coed this band of marijuana Farmers out of hiding to join forces and push the coming policy in their favor I wonder if this is really the best option these Farmers have for surviving the arrival of big business while old school Growers like are tackling policy in the hills of Menino I've come down to the township of Leonville to speak with a new breed of Weed Farmer these guys moved to the  triangle after medical marijuana went legal in the 9s and they became known as the green rushers among them were Jessica and Jamie [Music] warm Jamie met Jessica at Burning Man as she was completing her PhD I know that's a sheep that's a sheep yeah and gives to the Sheep they are now raising their child Donovan on this idilic Farm where they also grow weed Northern California is one of the last places where you can you can grow and Homestead you know um on some relatively cheap California land right right here we have our Greenhouse  uhhuh the strains here I'm really excited about so in the back here we have a harleen we have a um an OG black and that's called happy valentine these small things are agent orange Donovan's watering they're they're tiny ones they're small sometimes I feel a little funny talking about strands when I'm in front of my kid or kids generally is that right yeah I mean I don't know it's a maybe a testament to how strong the stigma can be which is like this is something I do all the time I talk to people about weed  all the time and yet I feel sometimes a little like hesitant to be like oh OG again right something that I think we're coming out of and you know that's one thing that is so wonderful about this community this is just part of who we are you know uh the Cannabis is everywhere you know we throw barbecues here people bring kids the plants are here and it's just a normal thing while it's an Open Secret that marijuana farming is a huge industry in the Emerald Triangle most Growers have stayed hidden in the Hills due to the  ongoing threat of prosecution but in order to battle the large scale operators who will set up shop when the California Market goes fully legal Jam wants to be first to Market so he's taken the risk of opening a nursery on Main Street between a thrift shop and a health food store where patients and other Growers can buy clones of his plants this is the spot this is artifact Nursery cool hi this is Camille this to meet you come on in Krishna cool welcome this is it this is it this is where patients come in and  get signed in mhm so this is where all the plants are this is really the nuts and bolts of the nursery uhhuh you can smell it can you a familiar smell around here I must be used to it the hardest worker is ham right here on the floor he looks like he's hard at work hey man how are you you how you doing good patients can come in look at the Clones uh you know got a lot of different genetics you have like three different sizes you have like small Med that's exactly what we have so we start them in Rockell here  get you a pretty little babies so those are $12 you've got these they step up into 3 and2 in soil they've kind of grown a little more have a stronger root mass right uh and then you can buy them as large plants as well those are ready to these look pretty nice those are ready to grow one those in my apartment so what's this one here that's oldfashioned MH locally breed strain what I like about your spot here is that we're in the center of town basically like yeah mhm it's a very like clear recognition of something that  everyone knows which is in the Hills there are a bunch of people growing growing weed well there's two kinds of people in mesino County those that say they grow weed and those that don't say they grow weed those that are lying right so you're trying to I mean what it is is like here in this sort of like weed Capital you're putting down some rout some stake in the in the Main Street to say like we're a business are there any risks that are associated with that like what's on the line a lot yeah the risks yeah I mean it's  federally illegal um but uh you know it's it's allowed in the state of California for medical use and we just are doing our absolute best to stay within the guidelines yeah we abide by all the rules set forth prop 215 um and yeah and just take take that risk proposition 215 was a ballot initiative to make medical marijuana legal in California and was passed by the public in 1996 it allowed individual counties to make their own rules which include limits on the number of plants that can be grown and stipulated Growers must be  nonprofit but could receive quote unquote reasonable compensation a term left open to interpretation unsurprisingly enforcement of these regulations have been difficult for Growers to predict Federal and local police routinely conduct sweeping raids often tarring legal and illegal Growers with the same brush recently Trinity humbal and mesino County Sheriff's departments teamed up to conduct one of the largest raids busting multiple Farms over 4 days in June 2015 and destroying close to 100,000  plants everybody knows someone up here that's gone to jail right for something you know it's all pot related and I think that's a very real thing for a lot of us up here raising families raising small children is that there's always an element of risk whether you grow 25 plants or you grow 100 plants or you don't even grow on your property you grow on another property it keeps us up at night sometimes I think it can keep everyone up at night right getting anxiety about the police coming or um hey baby you know you worry it's like  that irrational fear that someone's going to take your child away from you I know huh that will never [Laughter] happen the level of danger faced by marijuana producers like the warms who dare to make themselves visible is decided by local authorities interpretation of crop 215 I went to speak with mesino Sheriff Tom mman to find out how he decides whom to raid what are some of the challenges of being in law enforcement in a region like Menino County where there's so much marijuana grown well I the challenges  are not that there's so much marijuana growing the challenge is that the laws that are on the books are not black and white and I'm going to say that there is no agreement on what the law marijuana laws are in California so my focus is to go after the people who are in my opinion taking advantage of the Goodwill voters of 1996 when they passed proposition 2115 and how are people taking advantage of that proposition well I proposition 2115 was written to be a medicinal marijuana ordinance a law and it's a very vague law but  20-year-old with a sore shoulder who says he's growing to improve his quality of life maybe needs to suck it up and get a job and uh the sore shoulder is going to go away and they've turned it around to say this is my god-given right to grow marijuana well wait a minute is it god-given right of your neighbor to be able to go in their backyard and trim their roses or have a barbecue without smelling marijuana I say it is and I imagine since this is such a big County that the actual nuts and bolts of  enforcement is kind of a challenge in and of itself for the most part our marijuana investigations are complaint driven you know if a neighbor called and said my neighbor's growing marijuana and I think the Sheriff's Office should investigate our Deputy would go to the house and they' look and if need be eradicate the Marijuana arrest the person and see that they get their day in court do you think that people should be able to grow marijuana and make a living from it I think people should abide by the law and  proposition 215 wasn't a proposition on how to make your house payment if they're selling one plant as and making a profit on it they're in violation of the law because they're a commercial marijuana operation I mean the reason I asked that question is that there are a lot of people who believe that the only way to survive as a medical marijuana grower in this County specifically as like legalization in California might come you have to be upfront you have to say this is who I am I am a grower but  they feel that the danger of doing that is getting undue enforcement on uh compliance issues from the sheriff's department I can tell that you've been influenced by some people's very strong opinions well and in a sense I'm trying to bring their their complaints to you to see how that uh how you respond to them remember when proposition 2115 was passed by the voters it did not allow for any profit Heering so while there's people who say this is how I make my living you know and I have to make my  house payment I have to pay my child's orthodon bills and so forth I'm saying well that's great but that's not what the law is you know the law might change there's like certainly a lot of energy towards making recreational or adult use legal is that something you'd be in favor of how do you think that would affect the county I have so many things to worry about throughout my day that I do not spend a lot of time on hypotheticals sure but it's something that seems to be coming like the marijuana the legalization of  marijuana is a wave that's kind of hitting a lot of this country and medino County humbal County Trinity County it's where a lot of of the marijuana in this country is grown so how is it that you aren't preparing in a like sort of what how are you preparing you know I'm going to guess you're very good at what you do of of doing interviews and knowing how to operate a film crew and whatever okay I I'm very good at enforcing the law so while so excuse me I listen to you listen to me okay no one can predict  where we're going and and if we don't know where we're going we don't know what our problems are if we don't know what our problems are going to be we don't know what the solutions are yet but we'll figure it out thanks Sheriff appreciate the time while the worms take a risk by becoming the first to Market with a brick and mortar on Main Street I'm driving to humbold County just north of mesino to meet an altogether different kind of marijuana farmer hidden among the mountains here presiding over much  larger grows this region is home to the millionaire Outlaw so I'm going to meet this guy Ziggy who's been farming here for decades and apparently he uses a BMW as his farm truck so he's doing pretty well well here we are wild cat Farms this is called wild cat Farms wild cat farms and so this is one sort of large grow operation so how many plants are in this parcel right here this is a 99 plot uhhuh down below is Blue Dream uhhuh on the lower part of the tier what we're walking through here is old school AK-47  and I have Sour Diesel and what we found out is some of these fuy strains like the sour diesel have a synergestic effect with the opiates an American love drugs and when the doctor gives them the oxy the sour d or the OG gives that oxy a little extra bang for the buck like you take a look at this and it's big like this is a lot these are a lot of plants but like what what's the surrounding area like what what what did we pass when we were driving here oh you probably passed 700 farms in the 17 miles coming up the hill as you notice  700 700 yes there's probably a billion dollars annually in cannabis money that comes to this County you go to the gas station they have a cash counting machine um people come in that are running Diesel and might buy $77,000 worth of fuel in $20 bills that you can either weigh the 20 or you can run it through the machine but it it's a very unique cash economy here and where is that money going right now um it's going into the bank of the stump what's the bank of the stump we can't we don't bank with like the real Banks cuz they  take our money and they tattle on us so we have to hide our money you know in Humble County it's not uncommon to hear people um talk about I forgot where I buried 500k yeah that's sound would be really stressful it's just the the reality of it and how long have you been doing this for 40 years you've been growing weed for 40 years yes for a long time like it was not it was not legal oh God no no felony pot yeah felony pot did you ever get taken down or busted oh gosh yes I've been arrested yeah but never  convicted of a felony I was acquitted what is it like to go from something that was kind of like an outlaw business to something that is now considered potentially this corporate business the the corporate structure of now becoming friends with the banks who have never been my friends before and friends with the police who've never protected or served me um no no no I don't want to play that charade I'm 56 years old I'm about done I'd like to help take this to the legalization level and be able to hand the torch on to the  next Generation to improve or destroy it right but I would like to go buy a Maserati with a company paycheck before I'm done having made millions in his 40 years as an outlaw grower Ziggy is cashing out in face of full legalization I went to speak with the next generation of humbal wheat grower Ziggy's Protege Leo Stone about the financial impact of total legalization you have to have a certain level of scale just so you can be profitable because it's not a cheap business to cultivate cannabis right let's get in  it and what are these can these are sour diesel can you tell me like where Sour Diesel tends to be the most popular man sour d is the most popular on the East Coast you know um for the large part A lot of the buyers that come to pick up sour d are from the East Coast I mean in a sense it's an export crop right because it's so it's so popular around the country I wish it wasn't I wish we could keep the crop in state there's a lot of risk that's that's in play with people coming from the east coast and  buying your crop you know you you have to deal with the uncertainty that your buyer's not going to come back next year because there's a lot of risk for buyer just to come from the East Coast bring that large amount of capital so he could be able to buy up your crop then he has to send it back we're taking product out of state it'd be safer we kept it in States yeah but the retail prices in cannabis and California alone have kind of you know they remain the same you know past 7 to 10 years you're looking  at anywhere from a $6,000 to a $9,000 P pound retail right you know you cut that in half you know Growers should usually be getting anywhere from like 35 to 45 a pound which is what the status quo was for a long time but you know for some reason people are having a really hard time settling for 12 to, 1500 a pound and you know the general consensus in meno and humble is that you know a lot of a large part of the reason the bottom has dropped out of the wholesale Market was because of dispensaries the  illegality of marijuana has historically kept its prices artificially high with premedical marijuana prices peaking at close to $5,000 per pound after prop 215 was passed the prices Farmers could get for wholesale weed entering the medical marijuana Market dipped down to below $2,000 per pound by 2010 once the market goes fully legal in California it's expected that prices will drop even further due to the arrival of corporations that can produce on a large scale making the survival of small craft Farmers even less likely but  then what do you do as Growers do you keep you get bigger do you like how do you sort of combat the the falling prices it depends on what kind of price point you're looking for and it depends on who your network is because people that come from the Midwest and East Coast cannabis prices are inflated while Leo's Reliance on the black market might work as a short-term solution to weed's price drop what's going to happen if more states legalize or if California cracks down in the black market [Music]  entirely one farmer trying to find a sustainable solution to pot's Falling wholesale prices is Swami chya he runs ganja ma Gardens alongside his life partner Nikki lto and together they're capitalizing on his reputation as a maestro grower of Premium pot Swami was born in New York in 1943 and moved to San Francisco in the late 60s where he immersed himself in hippie culture that spiritual journey led him to India where he spent over 10 years he converted to Hinduism and became a spiritual teacher known as a Swami and  that's Po and Sh not the lord of the universe and then as you dance you can go the other leg too the same way the other leg and back and forth right like that returning to America he found his Indian spirituality Blended perfectly with the ideology of the back to the land hippie farmers who founded the Emerald Triangle and he has since become a Mainstay of the community and an expert cannabis [Music] producer that's that's me okay um I'm wondering can you take us around your property and sort of show us what you  got here all right how did you get inspired to do this well actually I had a vision a long time ago mhm it was on July 4th and we're all just like in Bliss with the nature and so on and and the medicine of the Peyote the sacred medicine MH I had this Vision I was about halfway down the mountain it's like someone turned on a slide projector right here in my third eye and this picture was like there was this this mountain this rounded mountain in the distance and then there was these trees this row of trees and then there was  this Golden Meadow yeah and then behind me these two giant pine trees is and this is like right here in my forehead and this say This brilliant picture right so then 30 years later almost to the day we took possession of this place and that was 12 years ago mm and how's it how does it feel to have sort of like a 30-year Vision kind of come true but then at the same time have that Vision kind of lay Complicated by the big business of of cannabis if say in Fresno Merced Central Valley they put up these  huge green houses and they're growing thousands and thousands of plants yeah that could take our Market away it's up to us to promote our product saying that this is pure it's organic it's grown in the Sun and it's the finest that you can possibly get and it has spirit and if you're going to industrialize something you're going to take the spirit out who do you want to grow your cannabis and how you want them to grow it you look like the kind of person I want to grow my cannabis well I'm very happy to do  that for you maybe we should go look at him yeah let's take a look okay so here we are at the Garden just walking out amongst them you're n mhm you're kind of exalted in a way just from the fact of this the air that they're creating these things are just in the sun this greenness and it's just it's thrilling to be in the plants we have a clean green certification which is actually more stringent than organic and so as a result we don't get 6 and 8 pound plants we get one to two to three to maximum maybe four pounds so  that's another kind of Challenge almost that you're another chall but that's why we're saying if you want the purest the best you can't be looking for quantity you're looking for quality and in order for that to sort of work economically you would need the per pound cost to sort of Bear right well but see we're hoping that that that the price of cannabis is not simply a bulk commodity price you know like wheat Futures in Chicago M because it's got to be quality priced just like wine you can buy Two  Buck Chuck maybe you're happy with that fine enjoy sure but if you want a real Ambrosia right you're going to pay 30 40 $50 $60 for for one bottle and we do get a premium price for our cannabis we definitely do what are the what's the sort of you know going rate for your stuff versus may not whether I really ought to tell you okay uh going rate for a wholesale pound of cannabis is anywhere from $1,000 to $1,500 a pound mhm M we get from 22 to 27 so maybe that sort of cuts to the heart of it in a sense is  like is weed a commodity or well weed might be a commodity but cannabis isn't okay right and so actually in our Movement we are trying to use only the word cannabis because it is what you call it and we're calling it weed it's not a weed look at this beautiful plant and it's not just growing [Music] randomly so listen we've been waiting a long time to get loaded here tell me which one would you like to smoke we got got CET here okay and take a smell of that one see this is what a connoisseur will  do the first thing they'll smell they'll smell the Cannabis and then they'll look at it it's a it's Piney and Lemony Piney and Lemony right and this one is called Orange turbo that's a little skunky and maybe like tea yeah mhm I don't know you tell me which yeah well no you tell me it's your nose it's your weed right cannabis [Music] and how did you guys me known each other a long time I could begin to guess how many joints we've smoked together over that time well not only that but how many incarnations  we've had together sure now in a very new incarnation of this relationship because well we have a spiritual marriage yeah you have a spiritual well he he took a lot of vows when he became a Swami I say it's not one of those vows being s mag but what's even worse is he doesn't eat onion and garlic and I'm Italian so that's the hardest part but let's show that to the cameras like like on John Stewart or something like that it's like Uncle benle Ben converted cannabis what it started as a joke really but then it became The Branding  is for real you know this is something if you're going to get into the future Market you better start your branding now so we were very lucky we already kind of had a foot in the door we're actually getting a tradar marked and everything as we speak yeah oh yeah well and it's also like you have uh in Swami like a personification of the actual product that you're kind of selling right he is s of a good image well he fits yeah really one of the things we're doing with the Swami select salons is you know  that the people that you know meet the grower meet the farmer so it's an educational process to say wouldn't you really rather have your cannabis grown at Turtle Creek for 60 bucks an eight oh I'm feeling pretty [Music] uh I could see Swami's brand becoming akin to the D peran of marijuana a prestigious Market position he and other small independent labels will need to hold out against the might of corporate [Music] cannabis I've come to the largest wholesale medical marijuana purchaser in the world Harborside dispensary to speak  with owner Steve D'Angelo I wanted to know how the biggest player in the current medical marijuana market and the Cannabis tycoons who will follow him will affect the craft scale farmers of the Emerald Triangle you come through these doors and you see this kind of like beautiful Mecca of like of cannabis sales it's amazing so here you'll see our sample cases are all of these are grown in California all of these are grown in California is this a typical dispensary well we are probably the largest retailer of cannabis in the  world as far as I know uh when we first opened this spot uh people looked at me like I was crazy they're like you're never going to be able to serve as many patients it's way too big so now we're going to go from the public part of the facility into the private secure part usually not this so uh this is the intake room this is where Growers will uh bring us their medicine and we put it through a quality control process I'll show you how that happens so big bags of weed here yeah I mean it depending on what your scale is  uh we would call these average size bags of weed well I'll pretend to be a grower who comes in all right so hey Steve hey CHR how you gr this weed for you all right well let's take a look at it and so what I'm going to be looking for here is you can see there's some little crystall and structures on the surface of the vegetable material there so those are called tricomes and that's where all of the active ingredient of the cannabis plant lives there is no active ingredient in the vegetable material  itself uh so by looking at the size and the shape the color and the density of those tricomes we can get a basic understanding of the quality of that cannabis the potency of the Cannabis and whether or not it was grown to full maturity or Beyond full maturity a lot of your economics I'm imagining are based on how you price your inventory as it comes in and for the farmer a lot of their economics is based on how much they can get for each pound that they sell well this is really the most critical part of our whole  business model because if we don't buy the Cannabis that our patients want we won't be able to sell it right so where are we headed now we are uh getting close to the most secure part of the facility which is the Vault where we store our cash where we store our bulk medicine mhm so uh this room also is biometrically controlled [Music] okay watch your step on the way up here so this is our vault well it smells great in here yeah well for obvious reasons we don't want to have ventilation shafts in the most secure  part of the facility so don't drop in here you'll see some of the bulk cannabis that's come in recently uh-huh and so you can see here all this cannabis is uh is in our branded right exactly so is this stuff that you guys grow or is this this is farmer grown no this is just our standard packaging so whatever grower brings us to it our top shelf always goes into these jars mhm what is the actual flow of cannabis to money like give me a sense of the sort of scale of the operation well we sell several pounds of cannabis uh every day  uh and we take in you know north of $25 million a year uh at this particular shop right prop 215 requires that all marijuana companies including Steves remain nonprofit putting extra earnings into community services and Charities we will happily Embrace a for-profit model with equal enthusiasm as soon as that's legal but until then we'll obey the law rigorously until now Steve has been buying weed from local Growers like Swami and repackaging it thwarting any attempts they make at branding themselves but Steve has even bigger  plans for when Pop becomes legal that will change the industry completely so uh right now we are in one of central California's traditional agricultural regions and we're going to be touring uh what I think uh is the future of cannabis agriculture in California or at least a part of that future uh-huh wow this is huge yeah this is uh this is quite a large greenhouse and how many plants do you think could fit in one of these warehouses or one of these green houses um you depend entirely on the size of the plant uh but in the  thousands of plants thousands of plants and they would produce thousands of pounds of of Bud they would it's exciting right I mean like there's a there's a way of looking at this and saying like wow this is a lot of weed that's going to be grown here in California by scaling up we're going to be able to start providing the consistency uh that the Market's really looking for and would you be able to operate a place like this at full capacity under the medical laws or would recreational marijuana have to be  legalized uh right now this would is not something that would be sanctioned uh by regulation we're working ahead we're looking forward to the day when that will happen how will places like this affect the sort of larger industry and the way that people grow there's certainly going to be displacement as this industry changes my hope and my belief is that this industry can be created in a way so that there's a lot of different tiers uh for different levels of production I think that there's plenty of consumers  who are not going to want cannabis that's produced in a large facility at a large scale they're going to want cannabis that's grown in very small plots by Master Gardeners and I think of anybody's a really talented cannabis grower or a really talented concentrate maker or a really talented manufacturer of cannabis products that they're going to have a much much better future in the legal economy than they do in the underground economy now people who have just sort of been skating along uh because it's illegal and they don't need  to try very hard and they don't need to compete uh those folks are not going to have a place in the new market and and you know I don't think that's a bad thing you know when we say big marijuana and you look at a place like that could have a potential like this would someone say that you are big marijuana and you're going to steal my business or you're going to steal my market share or you know you're embodying a future that might not be in line with what we think the plant is I don't think the big  marijuana is a Bad Thing uh I think that big marijuana done the way that every other Big Industry in this country has been done is a bad thing but we have a potential to create a new kind of industry and that's what we need to do look there's going to be a battle for the soul of this industry uh it's underway already uh there's going to be people who are going to try and craft it in the image of every other single American corporate industry and the only way that that is not going to happen is if people who care about the plant and  people who care about the future step up to the plate and start creating companies and start creating products and start creating brands that will be values based [Music] propositions after my time here I've come to realize that however the small farmers choose to adapt be it by branding their Farms as the Dom peran of cannabis or passing the mantle to the Next Generation uniting with fellow Farmers to influence legislation or rushing to become the first to market the likely winner in this new era of legalization will be the  consumer marijuana quality options and services will increase while prices will fall and so it goes in America big business will make the bulk of profits while the tens of thousands of Growers of the Emerald Triangle will fight to stay alive in this Brave New Marketplace these farmers are more than just stoners ERS making easy money in the Hills they are the heart and soul of marijuana farming in America and a living link to its Origins and so the fact that a great number of them will not survive this  transition feels like a loss whether legalization spells the death of the very society that founded this industry or whether growing evolves into something even better one thing's for sure it's been a privilege to have glimpsed this Bastion of renegade cannabis culture before it burns out [Music] hello [Music] 	Conservative			Leaning

C322	https://youtu.be/MZdXy2cvNyY?si=Q7f6I2es3erAmJJE	MARIA: WELCOME BACK THE NEW CHAIRMAN OF THE HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON CHINA JOHN MOLNAR IS WARNING AN ALARMING LACK OF URGENCY FROM THE ADMINISTRATION TO ADOPT OFFENSIVE MAJORS UNDER MEASURES TO PROTECT THE MILITARY BASES IN THE PACIFIC AGAINST POTENTIAL CHINESE ATTACKS. IN A LETTER TO THE AIR FORCE AND NAVY HE WRITES THIS, AMERICAN MILITARY BASES IN THE END OF PACIFIC ARE UNDER THREAT WITH THE CURRENT STRIKE CAPABILITIES, CHINA CAN ATTACK ALL U.S. BASES IN THE REGION AND UNCLASSIFIED ANALYSIS SUGGEST CHINA HAS  ENOUGH WEAPONS TO OVERWHELM OUR AIR AND MISSILE DEFENSES PROTECTING THE SPACES, JOINING THE GATE STONE INSTITUTE SENIOR FELLOW AND AUTHOR OF THE COMING COLLAPSE OF CHINA AND CHINA IS GOING TO WAR, AND WARDEN CHANG BACK WITH ME. I WOULD GET YOUR TAKE, WE KEEP INTERCEPTING CHINESE NATIONALS WHO ARE TRAINED TO GET INFORMATION FROM OUR MILITARY BASES, WHETHER OR NOT TRYING TO BREAK INTO MILITARY BASES YET THE SURVEILLANCE BALLOON HOVERING ABOVE MILITARY BASES, A YEAR AGO. IT IS ALL ABOUT STEALING INFORMATION AND UNDERSTANDING  WHAT THE UNITED STATES IS DOING, WHAT IS ADMINISTRATION, ISN'T AWARE OF THIS? >> I HAS TO BE AWARE OF THIS BUT THE POINT IT'S DOING EXTREMELY LITTLE. ALMOST NO SENSE OF URGENCY IN THE GLOBAL OFFICE AND ALMOST NO SENSE OF URGENCY AT THE TOP LEVELS OF THE PENTAGON. WE HAVE A PROBLEM IN THOSE CIVILIAN AND MILITARY RANKS. IF YOU LOOK AT U.S. BASES IN THE REGION, I THINK THERE'S GOING TO BE VERY LITTLE LEFT STANDING AFTER THE FIRST HOUR IN A WAR UNLESS THE COUNTERMEASURES WORK, RIGHT NOW THAT IS A BIG UNKNOWN  BUT CLEARLY CHINA HAS MORE MISSILES THAN WE HAVE DEFENSES. MARIA: IT IS INCREDIBLE TO ME THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS DOING NOTHING ABOUT THIS DESPITE THE FACT THAT WE GOT THESE SIGNALS THAT THEY WANT ALL THIS INFORMATION FROM OUR MILITARY BASES. THIS IS SUCH A NATIONAL SECURITY RISK, WE SEND ALL THE ADMINISTRATION TO BEIJING WITH XI JINPING HAVE YOU SEEN ANY PROGRESS WITH THE MILITARY AND COMMUNICATING WHICH IS WHAT THEY CLAIM THEY WANT TO DO. >> IS NOT REALLY A SURPRISE SINCE WE HAVE A COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF WHO IS  COMPLETELY COMPROMISED TO THE CHINESE CARD MEANEST PARTY. HE AND HIS FAMILY HAVE TAKEN TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS FROM THE CCP RELATED ENTITIES. OF COURSE THERE'S NO INCENTIVE ON THE PART OF JOE BIDEN WERE ANYONE IN HIS ADMINISTRATION TO TAKE MORE AGGRESSIVE ACTION WITH REGARD TO CHINA. THERE HAS BEEN A FREE-FOR-ALL INCLUDING ON THE BORDER. MARIA: IS THAT WHY WE HAVE SEEN NO PUSHBACK ON COVID AND THE CHINA ALLOWING COVID TO LEAK OUT OF THE LAB AND ALISHA ON THE WORLD. HOW SELECT SUBCOMMITTEE BRAD  WENSTRUP CONFIRMING WHAT WE ALREADY KNEW, HE SAID THE CLASSIFIED STATE DEPARTMENT RECORDS RECORDS CREDIBLY SUGGEST THAT COVID ORIGINATED FROM THE LAB LEAK IN WUHAN AND THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY TRIED TO COVER IT UP THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I REPORTED ON ON THIS PROGRAM FOR YEARS FROM DAY ONE. CHAIRMAN WINSHIP JOIN ME AND SAID EXACTLY THIS PACKAGE WOULD BE 23. >> YOU HAVE SEEN WHAT WE REVEALED THROUGH THE SUBCOMMITTEE ON THE PANDEMIC WITH THE INTERNAL DOCUMENTS FROM THE PEOPLE THAT ARE SAYING THIS  CAME FROM MAJOR NOTHING TO SEE IN CHINA. INTERNALLY THEY ARE SAYING IS VERY LIKELY COULD'VE COME FROM THE LAY AND DR. FAUCI SAID THERE UNTIL THEY KNOW THEY'RE DOING THIS RESEARCH IN WUHAN. MARIA: THE ADMINISTRATION HAS NOT HELD CHINA ACCOUNTABLE AT ALL. EARLIER THIS WEEK BRAD WENSTRUP WROTE A LETTER TO ANTHONY BLINKEN REQUESTING HE DECLASSIFIED THE RECORD TO SHARE THE TRUTH ABOUT THE ORIGINS OF COVID. WHY HASN'T THIS BEEN DONE ALREADY, IT'S BEEN FOUR YEARS? >> IT IS BECAUSE YOU HAVE FOR INSTANCE THE WORLD HEALTH  ORGANIZATION WHICH IS DOMINATED BY CHINA AND ANTHONY FAUCI HAVE LED THE CHARGE AMONG THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY TO PROPAGATE THE LUDICROUS NOTION THAT THIS WAS CAUSED BY THE PROVINCE WHO TRANSFERRED THE PATHOGEN TO INTERMEDIARY MAMMAL THAT WHEN A THOUSAND MILES TO WUHAN AND THEN MADE IT TO HUMANS. NO DOCUMENTATION FOR THE TRANSMISSION LINKS. BY THE WAY THE OF JOE BIDEN AT THE END OF THIS MONTH IS DETERMINED TO GET POWER MORE POWER TO THE W.H.O., DICTATORIAL POWER IN PANDEMICS ABOVE FOR PANDEMICS BECAUSE BIDEN WANTS TO  CITE THE PANDEMIC TREATY WHICH BASICALLY ELIMINATES OUR SOVEREIGNTY IN OUR ABILITY TO DEFEAT DISEASES IN OUR OWN COUNTRY BECAUSE THOSE DECISIONS WILL BE MADE IN GENEVA BY DOCTOR TED DEROSE WHO CHINA OWNS. MARIA: THAT'S INCREDIBLE. XI JINPING IS IN BUDAPEST TODAY. HE HAS MEETINGS WITH HUNGARIAN PRIME MINISTER AND OTHER OFFICIALS AS HE WRAPS UP THE THREE NATION EUROPEAN TRIP. ENTER PRESIDENT XI IS EXPECTED TO SIGN ANY SUDDEN AGREEMENT TO BUILD A SHARED FUTURE WITH SERBIA. WHAT IS THE IMPACT OF THIS TRIP?  >> THIS IS BASICALLY GOING TO UNDERMINE THAT YOU WHIRLS ON SUBSIDIES. HIS FIRST STOP WAS FRANCE WERE THE MAJOR DISCUSSION WITH CHINESE SUBSIDIES TO EV MAKERS, XI JINPING IS ABLE TO EVADE THAT BY BUILDING A BATTERY PLAYER IN THE CAR PLANT WHICH ARE NOW UNDER CONSTRUCTION IN HUNGARY, THAT IS INSIDE EUROPE AND MORE IMPORTANT INSIDE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION AND THAT MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR BRUSSELS TO DEAL EFFECTIVELY WITH CHINA'S PREDATORY TRADE PRACTICES BECAUSE HUNGARY IS ESSENTIALLY CHINA'S ALLY AND IS DOING  CHINA'S BIDDING. MARIA: RECENTLY THE ADMINISTRATION SAID IT'S GOING TO PUT SANCTIONS ON CERTAIN COMPANIES AND PUSHBACK ON THE THREAT OF THOSE COMPANIES TAKING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, ARE YOU EXPECTING ANYTHING TO REALLY MATERIALIZE HERE? >> THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION WILL DO THE MINIMUM NECESSARY AND THEY FOR INSTANCE WILL STRENGTHEN THEIR RESTRICTIONS ON CHIPS AND CHIPMAKING EQUIPMENT AND THEY WILL STOP THE EXPORT OF A.I. SOFTWARE TO CHINA WHICH IS A GOOD THING BUT IT'S TOO LATE, THESE ARE THINGS ABIDING THE  ADMINISTRATION SHOULD'VE BEEN DOING ON DAY ONE NOW THEY HAVE AN ELECTION LOOMING SO THEY DECIDED THEY NEEDED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT CHINA BUT THEY DON'T HAVE THE HEART AND IT WHICH IS A REAL INDICATION AS MONICA JUST TALKED ABOUT THE MOTIVATION OF THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION NOT TO DO THINGS ON CHINA OR TO DO THINGS AT THE VERY LAST MOMENT BECAUSE THEY KNOW THEY HAVE AN ELECTION RULING IN THEIR FUTURE. MARIA: THEY ALSO CLAIM THAT THEY TRY TO CONVINCE CHINA TO STOP THE SUPPORT OF RUSSIA AND ITS WAR ON UKRAINE AND VIRTUALLY ALL  THE CHINESE COMPANIES INCLUDING RUSSIA INCLUDING MILITARY SUPPORT ARE PRESENT IN THE U.S. INDEX FUNDS. U.S. INVESTORS ONCE AGAIN UNWITTINGLY OR WITTINGLY FUNDING THE EXPANSION OF COMMUNIST CHINA MOVING HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS A YEAR INTO THE COFFERS OF THE CCP THANKS TO WALL STREET EXECUTIVES AND TO THIS ADMINISTRATION NOT MAKING ANY CHANGES TO THE COMPANIES THAT TRADE ON OUR EXCHANGES. >> AS ROGER ROBINSON HAS HAD ON YOUR PROGRAM ALL YOU HAVE A 401K AT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND THE THRIFT SAVINGS PROGRAM.  THEY CAN INVEST IN CHINESE COMPANIES THAT ARE SANCTIONED BY THE COMMERCE DEPARTMENT. THIS IS JUST INSANE IT IS HIDEOUS AND YET WE ALLOW THIS TO GO ON. WE KNOW FROM DAY ONE THAT CHINA HAS BEEN SUPPORTING REGRESSION MORE AND UKRAINE AND INCLUDED WITH LISLE UNTIL LEGAL ASSISTANCE. PRESIDENT BIDEN SAID LETHAL ASSISTANCE AS A REDLINE AND HE'S BEEN SAYING THAT FOR THREE YEARS AND YET THEY'VE DONE ALMOST NOTHING. IT'S REALLY WRONG AND THE ONLY THING THAT THEY DID, TWO WEEKS AGO WHEN THEY SANCTIONED CHINESE  COMPANIES AND THAT WAS A MEANINGLESS SANCTION BECAUSE WHAT THEY REALLY NEED TO DO IS GO AFTER THE CHINESE BANKS AND THEY NEED TO GO AFTER THE REGIME ITSELF, THAT IS THE SOURCE OF THIS EVIL. MARIA: ANY THOUGHTS ON TIKTOK SUING THE U.S. GOVERNMENT NOW FOR THIS PROPOSED BAN? >> TIKTOK SAID IT WOULD RAISE A FIRST AMENDMENT CHALLENGE IN THE COURTS WHEN THE LEGISLATION WAS ENACTED, THIS IS NOT A FIRST AMENDMENT ISSUE, THIS LEGISLATION IS NOT GOING AFTER THE CONTENT OF VIDEO ON THE SITE IT'S GOING AFTER THE CONDUCT ON  TIKTOK. FOR INSTANCE IN ILLEGALLY STEALING THE DATA OF 170 MILLION AMERICANS AND BY THE WAY THE CEO OF TIKTOK IN LATE JANUARY SAID THIS WAS NOT HAPPENING WHICH MEANS HE WAS COMMITTING PERJURY BECAUSE WE KNOW FROM SOURCES SUCH AS FORBES AND BUZZ FEED THAT TIKTOK HAS BEEN STEALING ALL THE DATA THAT IS COLLECTED IN THE U.S. AND SENT TO BEIJING. THINK THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT NEEDS TO START THE PROSECUTION OF THE TIKTOK CEO. MARIA: WILL SEE ABOUT THAT 	Center			Center	41

E19	https://youtu.be/tNpf6905icg?si=MV226gNT_dQIuu0l	baby where did you go where are you tell us you're saying please I don't know he's just gone like I really wish primink would come back so sad I didn't die hello this is scary and I'm sweating so I was gone for legitimate reasons and I'm not supposed to talk about them or out loud I think I don't know what I'm allowed to do anymore so I'm not gonna mention it but what I can tell you is I bought a plant and I named a Frank and he's a little cutie patootie anyways I have a video here it was hard to make  because I forgot how to edit and script and do most things but I drink a lot of coffee and I cried a little and I kind of like how it turned out this is a story about one of the biggest mysteries on the internet I hope you enjoyed it hey guys so today I wanted my Facebook and asked you guys some questions what is your favorite day why I love you I love you too my favorite day of the week is Thursday fans fear for Marina's safety due to really bizarre behavior on her YouTube channel so for all you  ladies and men out there I actually seriously recommend that you come vegan is Marina what is going on number one I haven't changed and you've all got this impression that I've changed she had some visible bruising she started acting really bizarrely was she kidnapped what she being abused was she on drugs some people are saying she got kidnapped I know that you're sad the tears run down your face you think about how painful it is to feel this way this way ten years ago a British teenager named  Marina Joyce created a YouTube channel this is something new anyway hi my name is Miranda Joyce what's your name for videos were what you'd expect from that period She had skits tutorials or stories a little bit of everything but something about Marina's Channel seemed to stand out to people because her Channel grew pretty fast reaching 600 000 followers in just a few years she was quirky and emo and I think back then on YouTube that was kind of the thing to be you had all these weird emo people  running the place and guess what they all turned out to be weird emo people who would have thought you want me to kiss you how can I resist now you may be wondering why are we interested in this young teenage girl and you know that's that's a valid question but it's because six years after creating her Channel Marina will become the center of one of the biggest mysteries on YouTube it's 2016 the year of female Ghostbusters oh I don't have a cat is a dog his name's my cat your dog's name is my cat and my cat  this movie actually wasn't that bad you guys are just haters at the start of the Year everything seemed normal Marina was a little older and a little less emo you saved one thank the Lord but as the months go on Marina's personality begins to change what is your favorite day why I love you I love you too my favorite day of the week is Thursday and it's because ever since a child I just always loved the day Thursday now at first the changes were very subtle she started repeating herself and her body movements  became almost robotic But as time went on the changes became more noticeable so for all you ladies and men out there I actually seriously recommend that you become vegan and also the vegan products out there are really good for your skin so you should actually look into getting vegan products because they're really nice for your skin and they're really healthy for your skin so I recommend them highly for your skin this weird Behavior goes on for months and some of Marina's viewers at the time begin to notice and start leaving  comments out of concern now Marina sees these comments and decides to address these concerns in a q a video number one I haven't changed and you've all got this impression that I've changed and it's actually all because of all the dislikes and stuff which I know that you're like oh she's changed because of all these dislikes but I just want to let you know that I haven't changed this reminds me of when I'm like in the shower and I'm arguing with myself you know do you guys do that yeah we were right in that situation no you weren't  right you're dumb yeah but okay you know what Marina tries to assure her audience that she is fine but in reality she looked the worst she has ever been she was repetitively rambling and seemingly on the brink of tears and she blames all the concerned comments on a click bait thumbnail she did a while back now I couldn't find the thumbnail but apparently it's a censored is that allowed to be said um I'm talking about the animals chill look at these cute little running around clearly the explanation she gave didn't  make any sense and at this point the concern was growing rapidly with every new video she posted the comments began to get more and more filled with people confused with what was going on her entire personality changed in the span of a few months but Marina continued uploading like nothing was happening all of this concern reaches a Breaking Point when Marina uploads a now deleted video titled date outfit ideas so today I'm advertising style u and I'm advertising their clothes so this is me just advertising her clothes and yeah I  love you guys so much on the surface this video was a normal sponsored ad but when you look closer some very concerning things begin to stand out for one where Marina was showing her outfits you can clearly see her arms are covered in bruises then during the video you can see someone off camera directing Marina where to stand which this was very odd because Marina's Channel had always just been her by herself or with some friends and now someone is behind the camera directing her the most concerning thing  happens at the start of the video the camera pans down to show Marina's dress and a faint whisper could be heard and it sounds like Marina saying help me [Music] two days after this video was released an anonymous fan posted a long article documenting all the changes that have been taking place to Marina and they claimed that Marina was possibly being held hostile are kidnapped and in serious danger this post finally broke the dam and this is when Marina Joyce became one of the biggest mysteries on  the internet fans here from Arena's safety is Marina Joyce okay what is going on she had some visible bruising was she kidnapped was she being abused was she on drugs some people are saying she got kidnapped within days the marina story became widespread news hashtag Sabrina Joyce was trending number one on Twitter Marina's Channel gained 1 million subscribers and her videos gained 50 million views practically overnight it's kind of hard to portray how big this was I remember when all the stuff came out I  was a child and I was reading all the tweets and I was watching all the videos and I was just thinking hey guys why aren't we helping this girl out clearly something's wrong someone needs to do something I can't I have a bedtime but you know someone come on do something now the odd thing is that when this was all blowing up Marina Joyce was completely silent on the topic for days and instead said she was tweeting some very strange things if you want to party with me question mark winky face heart  tweet me now if you want to party with me smiley face I'll put details out for where to meet soon for the day meet me at Beth no green at 6 30 a.m if you would like to join partying with me at that event I don't know what that's called that's some weird thing probably I don't know bring a friend bring a friend so you don't get lost and then she posted a link to a Facebook event the issue with these tweets is that the event that she linked to wasn't on that day and it wasn't at 6 30 a.m so to put  this all into perspective everyone on the Internet is convinced that Marina has been kidnapped and instead of posting a simple video showing that she's fine she or whoever is running the account is trying to get everyone to go to an event that doesn't exist now people got scared that these tweets were some kind of trap done by Marina's captors to get a lot of people in one place to harm them calm down people and tweets started being made about calling the police to do a welfare check on Marina Marina sees these tweets and she  responds with no don't call the police that's absolutely ridiculous of you to do frowny sad face and then she replies to that sorry for the angry face I didn't mean to do that sad face I'm just extremely upset with you for suggesting that cry face heart Hmm this so it's short the cops get called and honestly I don't blame anyone because this this is some wild stuff right here officers have visited YouTube user Marina Joyce She is safe and well so the cops visit Marina's house and they confirmed that she wasn't  in any immediate danger she wasn't kidnapped she wasn't being held hostage but the story doesn't die here people began questioning if the cop's Twitter account was real which that was pretty dumb or they thought that maybe Marina looked fine to the police but was actively still in danger which honestly that's a fair point so in the following days Marina ends up going on a bunch of interviews to try and clear up what was happening hey guys I'm totally fine I'm doing all right everyone literally this literally sounds like a  hostage video hey guys doing fine here kidnapped what what are you talking about I'm just chilling here and and I just want to explain that everything's okay and I'm doing okay and I love you guys and you guys are so important to me thank you for all the love and support and I know that I'll never be in danger because of you guys in these interviews she explained that the bruises on her arms were from falling in the woods which I guess that could make sense but why is she in the woods I don't know is  she a werewolf or something who knows apparently the person pointing and directing her in the video is actually her mom and also the help me sound was supposedly also her mother trying to direct her now these explanations are all good and dandy but what she doesn't explain is the changes in her personality people have noticed that you've been like repeating words a lot in your videos uh is that just because you just do that a lot now or you know what's going on with that um I don't know I just don't know I just maybe  because I do that naturally I just naturally do that so after these interviews came out people finally accepted that Marina at least wasn't in any immediate danger but she still didn't truly explain what was going on and this is when the massive concern for Marina became something else after it was confirmed that Marina was not being held hostage you know in hindsight that was a pretty dumb Theory I don't know who came up with it but they need to chill so after that people began coming up with other theories on  what was going on the first theory was that Marina was faking everything from the start since her Channel grew massively during all this and her videos had gained nearly a hundred million views she profited pretty heavily from this event this would also explain why she took so long to squash the concern if she could keep the mystery going longer then she could theoretically bring in more views now since it's been seven years how do I make a noise that sounds like I'm going to the future I can tell you from the future that this  theory is not true unless she's an amazing actor and she's kept us going for this whole time is not true if it is give this lady an Oscar the next theory was that Marina was schizophrenic schizophrenia tends to develop in people in their 20s and 30s and the symptoms for schizophrenia are disorganized thinking and speak because they're really nice for your skin and they're really healthy for your skin so I recommend them highly for your skin extremely disorganized movements the reason why I've got dislikes and it's  not because I've changed by the way it's because I uploaded a fake the thumbnail and ever since then everyone's been disliking my video delusions hallucinations so a few doctors and psychologists online at the time started suggesting that Marina may be developing schizophrenia teachers are just textbooks schizophrenia and looking back at this this was kind of wild because you had these doctors and psychologists diagnosing Marina just over her videos the rewrite Soul would have had a field day that's all I'm gonna say you must  understand the realm of mental health the last main theory was that Marina was on drugs now the evidence for this theory was circumstantial but to everyone's credit the circumstances were pretty strong the Theory comes together when you dive deeper into Marina's videos just before and after everything blew up the word one when it means to me because of the experiences that I've been through brings me to tears what it means to Marina like I was the only one through all these really hard experiences to help myself and to bring  myself through it in this video marina is ranting about some event where she experienced almost dying and coming back to life she doesn't give any details about the event or how it happened or how she came back she just rants emotionally for 10 minutes about how she's happy to be back now people saw this video and they pointed out they're feeling like you're dying is commonly associated with psychedelics in another video marina is asked what her biggest wish is and she replies now I want to be a shaman how cool would it be just know  Marina Joyce is like a shaman so yeah that would be really cool I'd really love to be a shaman I'm planning to go Peru and Amsterdam soon so I'm super excited for those trips now Amsterdam is known for being the wild west when it comes to drugs and Peru is famous with tourists who want to do such psychedelic ceremonies with shamans and I know this might sound like some crazy paranoid connections to be making you might be thinking I'm on drugs um no I'm not everyone around me wants me to be medicated but you know what I call them  haters but the connections don't stop here days after save marina Joyce died down she started making very weird tweets I want to be a God Like Buddha I want people to call me goddess Marina Marina the goddess of love by this I mean I'm a soul entity Bound to You by how much I love you in my heart put that on a shirt you would sell at least one I'd buy it and the tip of this craziness comes in a very long Facebook post about Marina wanting to build a temple I found a couple secrets about the afterlife and  I know that I can still contact humans during the afterlife and I want to become God because I want to one day create a temple and a shrine where I am known as God of the shrine could everyone leave comments telling me explaining to me how I would build this Temple how much money what I need sorry it's hard to read how I can get somebody to sculpt a statue for me and paint it I want a statue representing the Divine love and spiritual guidance now I try really hard to put myself in people's shoes not because I like feet but in  this situation the only thing I can think of to explain this is that let's say I was in a stated illusion I have something where reality is not making sense to me and then suddenly out of nowhere everyone on the Internet is talking about trying to save me and all my videos are getting 100 million views and you know all this crazy stuff is happening maybe if I was in a state of delusion I could see this as a sign from the universe that I'm now God I could kind of see it but unfortunately the rest of the internet couldn't see this  and after all of these posts Marina becomes a joke and to create the most holy sacred place on Earth due to my magical spiritual connection with spirits this this eight months after Saint Marina Joyce Marina comes out with a video explaining what went on hey guys so today I'm going to be addressing saving Marina Joyce she seemed noticeably better in this video but that could be because the video is highly edited there's a jump cut literally every sentence her explanation of the events that took place was that  she suffered from depression and apparently that depression led her to some bad decisions the Assumption to make is that the quote-unquote bad decisions means drugs but that's all the info we get from Marina the video was pretty well received and I think it was because it was a good happy ending to save marina Joyce she was safe now she looked better and that's kind of all that people wanted but at the same time it felt like a portion of the story was still missing video local police post a missing  person's notice for Marina Joyce Marina we are here for you whenever you are ready we can listen talk you through what help you need pass a message for you and help you to be safe she had been missing for nine days at the time of this post and people online joked about save marina Joy's happening again which that was kind of mean this girl was missing and people were making memes the odd thing from this event is that Marina's boyfriend at the time made a post on Instagram telling people that Marina wasn't really missing and  everyone needs to calm down and side note this boyfriend gives me some bad vibes what I can find online it seems like they started dating right after the save marina Joy stuff happened the time when Marina was unintentionally super successful and probably had a huge influx of money you know you know what I'm saying you get what I'm putting down here and every video I watch of them together he kinda seems like he's her caretaker rather than her boyfriend here are all the shoes Nike huh just do it eh  hey no all right I have to say Marina these are very nice shoes you've done a very good job with these and look maybe he's just awkward on camera I'm awkward everywhere so you know I understand but I get some weird Vibes here okay back to the video she was found safely after 10 days but once again that's the extent of the information we get Marina goes back to uploading videos like absolutely nothing had happened where was she was she in trouble how was she found we get absolutely no answers hello it's present day Frank's doing  great I think you grew a new Leaf but you know I can't tell because he grows real slow he's just living in the life so the video was supposed to end here with an open-ended conclusion as to what happened with Marina I had it all scripted I had it edited and honestly I really liked it because I ended it like Unsolved Mysteries it was like what happened to Marina seven years ago we don't know it was great but while wrapping up this video I get a notification peaceful sacred me and kitties since we last Saw  Marina she um she calls her viewers sacred Moon kittens and she puts this filter on her videos that makes her look like a glowing angel I should have gave a little heads up on that my bad this video I'm gonna be spilling it out so yeah keep watching guys because I'm gonna be telling you the truth about everything that went on with me so this is the video we waited seven years to get finally Marina Joyce is going to tell the truth about what happened to her so the reason why in my videos I was so weird and laggy and like not well  well one of the reasons was I actually was going to party drugs okay well that's that's a wrap that's a wrap on that one I'm a bit conflicted here because even today if you go to Merida's Channel and you watch her new videos she does not seem okay for the last seven years she has essentially become a new person but if you actually watch her videos according to her she says she's happy and doing great and nothing is wrong so do you accept that this person is fine because they say they're fine or  do you realize that something clearly isn't right here and you try to do something I honestly don't know the answer to this I've reached out to Marina I've reached out to her boyfriend I've reached out to her's friends I've reached out to everyone that I could think of to get in touch with Marina and no one even responds so I have no clue what is actually happening outside of what Marina posts publicly I just kind of hope that she has people around her are making sure she's okay I've forgotten how new ground feels  you asked me to dance I don't stand a chance take me back [Music] I long for you to move me 	Center			Leaning

E70	https://youtu.be/fqp7X8mXLH0?si=pLGboSURW3VaVv54	this culde saac in Southeastern Oklahoma City looks like any other but inside this yellow house was a man with a secret and one woman would unearth the truth this is my lover and that's my wife I said what I seen him kissing her and I said you know what this is it hey True Crime besties welcome back to an all new episode of serial asly [Music] hey everybody welcome back to an all new episode of Serial asly with me Annie Elise here to break down another case that is going on right now in the True  Crime world and this is one that honestly makes zero zero zero zero sense to me I mean it makes sense because it's unfortunately a similar case to ones we have talked about before but what doesn't make sense to me is how parents and how humans can act this way and you know what I'm actually wearing my piece of merch that says make it make sense and it's pretty fitting for today's episode so here's what I want to kind of do before we jump into the episode I want to just say I feel like usually we  talk about cases where we know a little bit more about the people involved but today's case guys it's not like that at all now due to the sensitive nature of this story and to protect the victim's identity the person charged in this case has never publicly been named however as we go through the court documents and also the allegations you'll understand why why that is I also want to discuss this case with you guys because it has a much different ending than we normally hear in so many of the cases that we  cover and the vict in this case have spoken out in the this Anonymous style type of interview way because they want to tell their story they want to tell what happened to them what they were put through and they want to raise awareness so you're going to be hearing directly from them so guys let's just jump right into today's case in August of 2023 the police in Oklahoma City received a very haunting tip now this tip was about a man who lived in a very typical neighborhood in Southeastern Oklahoma  from far away the man's house looked completely and totally normal it had dark orange brick a pretty decent sized yard big beautiful trees and it was located in a culde-sac now I do want to mention that there was a toilet in the front lawn so it wasn't exactly a cookie cutter white picket fenced type of home but you get what I'm saying but despite the toilet this tip had nothing to do with the lawn or that toilet or the house it was about what was going on inside that house that was the issue see the tip that the officers received  was about a man that had introduced a female as his stepdaughter but then later this man was seen hugging and kissing this female again his quote stepdaughter now additionally this tip that came in indicated that the man had numerous children but none of the children could apparently read write or speak at an adult level police were also told that there were younger children living at the house as well and these younger children were actually this man and this stepdaughter's children and as if this couldn't get any weirder any  more creepy any more complex that stepdaughter slother figure was apparently a child herself Yes you heard me correctly a man had multiple children with his quote minor stepdaughter so the police had this tip which was obviously jolting I mean they were pretty freaked out by this and they knew that they needed to follow up on it they needed to go and talk to this man they needed to get to the bottom of it and see what the hell was going on here so one day police officers approached the front door of  this seemingly normal looking house they knocked and the man answered so police spoke with this man with his wife and with their four children who were all adults they all acted very confused like they had no idea what these officers were even talking about there's a mistake here we're adults we're a normal family we're fine and not only that but they said that there weren't even any younger children at all living in the house to begin with so they really wasn't much that the police could do here as disturbing as this tip was  police followed up on it and it didn't pan out everything checked out it was a normal family it was adult children nothing like what this person who called in this tip claimed to have seen so maybe somebody got the information wrong maybe the person who gave this tip was mistaken in the first place maybe they didn't see the stepdaughter and this man kissing and he had just been kissing his wife all along but not so fast so let's talk a little bit about who this person was that originally called in this tip  to the police that was so concerned with you know such unsettling information this person that called the tip in was a woman named Doris Cole and after the police went to this house and looked into everything and found that everything was normal everything seemed fine they told Doris they're like no we followed up on this everything was fine we talked to the family nothing was out of the ordinary there wasn't much we could do so it's not panning out end of story but dorus was absolutely certain  about what she had seen and she wasn't going to stop until she could prove to the police that she was telling them the truth something was wrong with this house something was wrong with this man and with this family so talking a little bit more about Doris and who she is Doris Cole is a business owner in Oklahoma City now she had initially met this man back in 2017 when she was hiring him as a contractor to paint some walls and ceilings for several of her different businesses she worked with him  on and off as a matter of fact until about 2021 so about 4 years but not long after starting to work for Doris apparently this man started bringing two of his teenage daughters to work with him all of the time and Doris said that she noticed that quote they all looked crazy every single day the clothing that they were wearing was was in terrible condition they apparently smelled really bad and the van that this man was driving and drove to work it looked like it was packed with clothes packed with  food definitely didn't seem like a normal vehicle that somebody is driving to and from work now Doris also noticed that the teenage girl's speech was really bad when she first met them even thinking that maybe they had an accent because their speech seemed so out of the norm seemed so you know Troublesome they also apparently could not read or write so she asked this man several times maybe the girls are homeschooled are you homeschooling them but she never got a straight answer this all gave Doris a very bad feeling she knew  something wasn't right here and she said she felt like she was going insane during this time because she was seeing all of these red flags but there was nothing that she could really do about it then one day she met the man's stepdaughter she met her in one of Doris's buildings that the man was apparently working working in she met her in the hallway and the first thing that Doris noticed was her appearance and she thought to herself wow that girl looks really young in fact she looks like she just had a child so Doris she's  doing the math she's putting the math together realizing it is not adding up it isn't making any sense at first she was thinking like okay maybe those kids are hers and his but then she started asking even more questions and because of this line of questioning because she was trying to get more information suddenly the family became very distant and then one day she never saw them again this was for 2 years then sometime in 2023 when the man decided to come back around he came to Doris and he said he was looking for  work so Doris she agreed to help him I mean sure she could use the help of course with her businesses but she also never got over that feeling of worrisome that she had and never got over that feeling of like questioning what the truth was what was really going on here knowing something wasn't quite right she even made a point in this moment to say to herself you know what I'm going to get to the bottom of it this time I'm going to figure out what is truly going on and this time this man is not getting  away interestingly though this time around as he's re-entering Doris's life the man had a completely different story than what he had previously told her he said look okay this isn't my daughter this is my love lover my wife all while he was pointing to the young girl and Doris later said that she saw them kissing saw them hugging and she finally said to herself you know what I'm done something's weird I'm calling the police so that is when the tip came in and that's when the police first came to the  family's home and began interviewing them and Doris was worried that when the police went out there and when the police would start talking to him that maybe the man would get spooked maybe he would disappear or run off with these people with this daughter with these kids similar to what he had done just 2 years before when she was asking him all of those questions and she definitely didn't want to let him get away now she didn't know exactly what their living situation was but she knew that the man  and his family lived somewhere not in their van not on the street but she didn't know much more than that she didn't know the specific location so to make sure that he didn't disappear didn't get spooked didn't run Doris offered to let the man and his family stay at one of her homes so that she could keep a closer eye on them now little did this man know that now Doris was working with the police she was watching them waiting and telling the police everything she saw and every detail that she could and what was about  to be exposed was going to be far more Sinister than any of them could have imagined and we're going to get into all of that guys after we take a quick break to hear from our sponsors of today's episode So lately I've kind of gotten into this new routine guys where

there was a lot of suspicion that there were in fact minor children involved in this family and that the reason that maybe they hadn't seen them when they had gone to do that  first followup after receiving the tip was because the children were hidden all along so now Doris is watching the family the police are watching the family the police are talking to the neighbors and all of their Spidey senses are going up thinking yes there are in fact minor children we are confident about this we need to go and check out this house one more time we need to see what is truly going on here so fast forward 1 month after first interview the family and on September 21st 2023 after speaking with Doris after speaking  with the neighbors all of these things the police surrounded the house again but this time the man wasn't there so the police reached back out to Doris to see if she knew where he could be see if she could help and sure enough she had the answer so this time police responded to this location and they were able to enter the home and upon further investigation much of which is still being uncovered to to this day what they found was horrifying it was unnerving it was foul and quite literally it was  against the laws of nature inside that house police discovered five children all under 18 years old they were unbathed they were completely unkempt and they had severe severe dental problems all of them there was also nowhere for the children to sleep other than one singular heavily soiled mattress that was on the floor and heavily soiled guys is a direct quote from the court documents none of these children had also ever been to a doctor they actually weren't allowed to go anywhere else alone but be  in that house they weren't ever allowed outside so in total let me just kind of break this down for you guys again because I know we kind of went through the beginning with like the lover the wife the stepdaughter it gets confusing because of all of the lies that were told but in total you have the man you have his real wife you have their three biological children you have this quote stepdaughter and then you have five younger kids so nine children adults and minors all living in this house and  under the control of this man 11 people in total with nine children hidden and nobody was allowed to leave this house without the man's permission according to the court documents the minor children were evaluated by a forensic interviewer but two of the children were non-verbal and could not communicate however the other three children were interviewed now guys the horrifying details that came out of this interview it's heartbreaking but it's also kind of one of those moments where you're like  thank God thank God these children were interviewed by a professional and they were able to get this information because had this information not come out this story this case may have a very different ending so in an interview with one of the children she had said that the man had touched her chest quote because he's a doctor she also said that he touched her quote privacy which was then described as her vaginal area she also said that he touched the other children in the same way whenever he would quote check on them almost as like  this way of playing doctor fake doctor with your kids with these minors touching them pervertedly is is so sick the man's wife was also interviewed but she was interviewed by detectives and she admitted that the stepdaughter and I say stepdaughter Loosely in quotes was she and her husband's biological daughter she also admitted that her quote stepdaughter was the biological mother to the five minor children and the man her husband was the children's biological father meaning that this this freaking creep had sex with his own  daughter fathered five children with her and then abused those children as well his kids slash grandkids slash I mean like it it makes your mind real it is so disgusting and as if that couldn't even get any worse his daughter had her first child that was fathered by him her own dad when she was just 12 years old this guy is a predator and a in every single definition of the word he is so beyond sick and just it makes me want to vomit now the court documents show that when the man was interviewed by detectives he  admitted that the children were he and his stepdaughters he also told investigators that the children had never been to the doctor they were all home birthed and they never had a medical professional there they also never went to school they never were homeschooled in any sort of way nothing just born into seclusion into and never given any sort of resources any sort of health care nothing nothing they were just used as accessories for his sick perversions it is so beyond disgusting so of course the  man and his wife were arrested right now initially the man was charged with two counts of sex and five counts of child neglect but his charges were later upgraded to include which duh and again thank God these children spoke up his wife is also facing several charges charges of enabling a child child neglect and child Evan Jess right now we can tell you that suspect and his wife are both locked up tonight here at the Oklahoma County Jail the father accused of multiple counts of child ab and sex  charges the wife is accused of allowing this on for years inside this Southeast OKC home court documents detail just some of the abuse a man inflicted on his children detectives say they found five children all under the age of 18 all of them with quote poor hygiene foul odor and lack of dental care according to court documents two of the children were nonverbal and could not communicate other children told police that they were touched inappropriately court documents say a business owner who the  suspect worked for contacted police back back in August after she grew concerned the suspect would clean her business she told police that he brought a woman who he identified as a stepdaughter to help but the owner witnessed them quote hugging and kissing so she called police according to court documents that tip led to the Discovery at the home the suspect admitted to investigators that the young children are all his and his stepdaughters she would have just been 12 years old when she first gave birth  he also said quote the children had never been to the doctor and were all home bir bir without a medical professional pres after the news of the parents arrests neighbors and family they all came out and were speaking out and they were horrified and disgusted we always thought something was going on in there we spoke with a neighbor reacting to the Discovery it hurts me because I got to see the young ones they never left the house with only with him Evan and Jess I've been going through these court documents all day long and really  looking into the couple's past including other states that they've lived in now the more we've dug into this and into their past the more intense those details get and the web they've created is disturbing court documents say a couple who lived in this home in Oklahoma City lived there with multiple adult children and five minor children court documents claimed the parents of the minor children were the homeowner and not his wife but his stepdaughter now OKC Police told KOCO this afternoon that woman May  not be a stepdaughter but could be the man's biological daughter and they're waiting on DNA tests if those tests show the man and young woman are in fact father and daughter the man can be charged with neighbors say they had suspicions about the relationships and what was going on in the home we never got to see anything until that day that I saw that Dad kissing the oldest daughter I went inside I told my daughter I saw that Dad kissing the daughter so I told you Mom I've been telling you mom right now the dad sits  behind bars and faces two charges and five counts of child neglect those two charges of according to officials are because the mother of the children gave birth to her first child at just 12 years old and the second at 13 Sky five flew over the house today where you can see toys in the backyard neighbors say the father was strict and the kids needed his permission to ever come outside the kids didn't go to school or anything like that so they will come out and play sometimes late like 10 11 sometimes documents also say  the children had quote poor hygiene foul odor and lack of dental care they will smelly all the time like really bad the man's wife is also Behind Bars facing multiple charges for enabling that neglect now this is a really complex case with a lot of people involved Kio will not be naming those suspects or any of the adults involved in this case in order to protect the victims and of course those minor children now we did reach out to DHS today for a statement and they did not have one but these documents do say that all five of those  minor children have been taken into DHS custody now this nightmare it was only just beginning and it wasn't anywhere near being over yet because the children were about to speak and we're going to get to that in just a quick minute after we hear from the final sponsor of today's episode I have a question for you do you ever have trouble sleeping

Behind Bars they're they're charged people are talking everybody is calling them out for who they are but here's where what I want to mention first and foremost before we get into the children's interviews one of the reasons that I wanted to cover this case is because it's not often that we hear from the victims we don't ever really hear from victims who have been rescued from situations like this one to go through severe neglect social isolation and on top of all of that all  at the hands of your own parents and then to come out of it on the other side and choose to see positivity in the world I mean it's absolutely abolutely remarkable and truly inspiring I mean the level of bravery I can't even imagine for minor children at that so I want to play the children's interviews that they did with a local Oklahoma City news station cuz I want you to be able to hear from them what their story is let them tell their story a House of Secrets and abuse in August Oklahoma City Police got a tip that a man had  multiple children with his stepdaughter that report would unravel a family and Shake an entire Community thank you for joining us here I'm Jessica shamba I'm Evan onto tonight we are hearing for the first time from the adult children on life behind those closed doors a family of 11 lived here Mom Dad and nine children hidden away from the world they never left the house with only with him the children had never been to school the doctors or even a movie theater all to conceal a secret they never knew was  wrong their dad's relationship with their step sister did you know that the younger kids were your dad's kids too that I already knew about I never knew that it was anything wrong with it we just grew up like if it was normal to us at 12 years old their oldest sister had her first baby with their dad according to court documents she gave birth to four more inside this home Kio sat down with three of the siblings who wanted to share their story so when she had her first baby you were just little  yeah I think I was 7 or eight did you ever question why you guys weren't allowed to leave the house more not too much because Dad always said that he didn't want us to get hurt or because he protect me us because of people that outside he tried to home to us and then it went from trying to not doing what was the feeling inside of your house I was hurt because my dad took forever to come the adult kids were left alone with their secret siblings waiting for their dad to face up to the crime both see her  also as a victim do you see that too now yes you don't think she should be arrested no no I never thought that Dad would touch us or say anything sexual to us I never worried about it I can't hate them because hate is a strong word I could only forgive them I could only forgive my dad and I could leave the rest of it into God hands today the adult kids still live in Doris's home and work for her they're now enrolled in school I'm doing bad on my reading so I read a book yesterday have their first IDs are  learning how to drive and working to get their sister's children back to her from State custody now looking back do you feel grateful that Doris intervened yes because she was helping us out I mean that was all pretty heavy to hear I'm sure I know it was for me when I first heard it and one of the things that stuck out to me the most in these interviews is when they talk about the fact how they thought that this was completely normal they thought that their sister having children with their dad was completely absolutely normal  which makes sense because how would you ever know otherwise if you're born into this environment you aren't watching TV you aren't seeing other relationships you aren't talking to friends at school how would you ever know that that isn't what normal human nature human life is all about you what existence is all about it's just so scary when you think that someone can weaponize just all of these things against someone in such a way to where like they're so calculated and they literally form thoughts for  these children at such a young age to where they're able to completely manually manipulate the way that the children see the world the way they see it the way they believe it to be true it is such an incredible responsibility and it's also just like it's such a high level of power to be able to do that and like these people are just that power and manipulating it for their own gain it is truly revolting it really really is now listen to Doris's reaction about this whole thing once police finally got  to the bottom of it once everybody was interviewed and when the truth was out there listen to what Doris had to say it just took someone paying attention and believe it or not he was telling on himself every single day no one listened I was looking for someone to paint the ceilings and he answered the ad Doris Cole hired the father in 2017 as a contractor she was opening several businesses at 10th in may see they looked really crazy every day the clothes from the clothes that they wore from the the smell he started taking two  of his teenage daughters to work and Doris picked up on something she couldn't let go they couldn't read they couldn't write and the speech was really bad when I first met her I thought she had she had an accent she would question the family's homeschooling the father's persistent phone alerts and the van packed full of food and clothing but there was nothing overtly wrong every day it was driving me insane because nothing I can do about it it was nothing I had to tell the cops until she met the  stepdaughter the first time I met her was in the hallway and I said man that girl look like she just had a child she was young um and he was looking at her as if she was some sort of candy I started putting stuff together I said okay maybe those kids are hers and his the family became distant Doris believes it was because she was asking too many questions but they came back 2 years later looking for work now this time I said okay I'm not letting this guy get away until I figure out what's going on  and this time the father told her the truth he said well this is not my daughter just one of the kids this is my lover and that's my wife I said what I seen him kissing her and I said you know what this is it I I called the police detectives began interviewing the family worried he would take them and run Doris let them stay in one of her homes as she worked with police without the family knowing and on September 21st police surrounded the home but Dad wasn't there uh they' asked me if I knew where he was  and I said well he's at his other house he said he was coming back um and so I called him and I said hey you know the police were at the house he's like to they see the kids I'm in amazed at the same time amazed and shocked that I'm looking at this entire family I never seen before I've seen bits and pieces and the condition that the little ones were in I never imagined court documents reveal the kids had poor hygiene foul odor lack of dental care and were sleeping on one heavily soiled m mattress on the floor investigators say  two of the children were nonverbal after 3 hours dad finally showed up I stood there on the porch I didn't get to see his face up front but I saw him from the porch that was one of the most satisfying days probably in my life to watch him go get in the police car all right take a seat for me both mom and dad were arrested how how did you watch that how did you hold your daughter's hand while she's having a baby by your husband you have a 26y old that can't read can't write how does she teach her kids that can't read or write  how to write it's is hard because I was the one that did it but I'm also the one that's taking care of it now Doris hopes the community can wrap around this family and lift them up as they navigate life for the very first time I'm hoping that um that if there's anybody that wants to help that is a genuine help and they've already been lied to and Hur their entire lives so I'm hoping that their journey in this world and the people that run into them would remember that reporting Kylie Thomas K 5  [Music] news I just got to say don't forus is a mother effan hero can you imagine had she not come forward and it would have been so easy for her once he fled the first time around to just wash her hands of it to just not let him back around because she thought he was creepy not do her due diligence not follow up on anything once she did call the police and they told her look the family is normal there's nothing more we can do everything checked out it also could have been so easy for her in that moment  to walk away once again and be like guess I was seeing things guess I was par hyper paranoid and I need to calm down I need to quit watching dat line or I need to quit listening to Annie but she didn't there were so many checkpoints along the way in which she could have just done the easy thing turned you know turned the other cheek walked away let it go and she didn't and because she was like a freaking dog with a bone with this guy and followed up on everything helped you know monitor his movements ask the questions she  literally saved multiple people's lives it is so unbelievable when you really think about it and it sounds so cliche guys but I'm going to say it it's just such a glaring reminder for all of us if you see something say something and always trust your gut if you're feeling like something ain't landing something doesn't smell right here keep looking at it I mean within reason I'm not trying to like throw you off the rails but like there's a reason that our intu no offense men but especially as females  there's a reason that our intuition is usually so spoton so I think hearing what this case was all about and hearing Doris's perspective of all of it and just how many times she kept following up I think it's inspiring of course but I also think it just serves as such a good reminder for all of us trust your instincts if something isn't feeling right there's a chance that it's not right so the man and his wife are current Curr ly in jail with their cases moving through the court system probably  slow because we know that the court system likes to move at a glacial Pace but at least they are locked up at least these children can go on to live somewhat normal lives and begin to repair and undo what they were taught and luckily they got out of the grasp of this Monster's hands before it was too late or God forbid before they fed more children or heathered more children I mean it's just again we very rarely hear an ending like this and it just although they went through their ringer I'm just  so happy that they are still alive and that these monsters have been identified and called out for what not even who what they are that is the right description so

E76	https://youtu.be/hNIJH5gufaQ?si=irZ7lT2Q0dMele-T	last weekend the trump freedom tour comprised of don his son and a caravan of folks looking for book deals headed to mississippi and i was curious who was shelling out the nine to four thousand dollars for a ticket to see the show much of the country was watching the revelations coming out of the january 6th hearings and surely these politically engaged folks were also tuned in have you guys been watching the january 6th hearings um no have you watched any of the january 6 hearings not really i had it bore up and  changing phones but uh good to what i changed phones are you watching them no no why not well anytime you don't have time to watch a two-hour hearing yeah no no how long are you here today until five until five which is you got here at i got here at seven seven which makes it ten hours right with the two-hour hearing who's got time for that most were paying no attention and yet there were some paying even less attention what about what happened on january 6th what do you think what happened there  i don't really know what happened on january 6th january 6th the election day no election day was back in november do you i don't even know what did you know about january 6th no so when i say january 6 that means nothing i don't know that's just a day to you yeah did you hear about the the insurrection attempt at the capitol no no for almost everyone here insurrectioning was a non-issue it was the hearings themselves that were the problem i think it's an abomination it's just mccarthyism it's a witch trial it's  a witch-hunt uh it is yeah it's like a mob of people coming together with pitchforks yeah saying and we can't have that yeah with uh with an agenda here's the narrative we're pushing and that's all we're pushing is our narrative a mob of people with an agenda pushing an agenda that can't stand in america no we should we should have an investigation about a mob of people that's something everybody would watch that absolutely oh nancy pelosi she start is very responsible for what went on then she planned it she she planned  what happened i believe so why did she plan to get attacked by a mom of trump supporters because she wanted to be able to blame it on the trump supporters and have something bad to say about him shouldn't we investigate that uh yes so you must be watching the january 6 committee no so what was it people were watching two thousand mules came out and it showed a lot of stuff you've got two thousand mules and then this movie i'm two thousand mules two thousand mules yes two thousand mules is a documentary by  dinesh d'souza claiming massive voter fraud based on some cell phone data and surveillance footage that's been lauded by trump laughed at by bill barr discredited by fact checkers and banned from even right-wing media because of its unfounded claims you notice you turn on fox news they have never mentioned that movie once somebody's pulling their strings who would you think it is uh it may be obama you think obama's pulling forward it could be a gold source you think it's possible that fox news doesn't mention 2000 mules  your theory there's a giant conspiracy up on top in which they don't do it or the second theory is that movie is not credible i know the movie's credible maybe sharing some of the committee's findings would break through this mugga bubble rudy giuliani was drunk the night of the election and it was partially his idea to deny the election results buy it i haven't seen that you're the first source i've gotten on you ever heard that at all no that rudy was drunk that night it's an election night i wouldn't be  surprised if anybody was so you trust a drunk rudy giuliani i'm not saying i trust a drunkeely rudy giuliani question is have you trusted yourself or other individuals that you are with under the influence of alcohol i totally have then what's the difference i am not the commander-in-chief in charge of the united states doesn't matter well i think that's a i think that's an important detail if no one was willing to turn on the hearing i decided to bring the hearing to them i first shared testimony from trump's own acting  attorney general dismissing trump's claims of voter fraud i told him that the stuff that his people were shoveling out to the public were  like i said you just can't be up 300 000 votes and then lose no but that's trump's attorney general does that sway you at all he's turned on him he's been been paid by somebody to shut his mouth everybody knows the election was strong no no he's saying the opposite he's saying the opposite yeah he's saying there wasn't fraud that that's why does it make you kind of change your perspective  and your assumptions it does yeah you're not going to go in there right now yes or i am you are going in there right now to see donald trump speak yes sir okay cool well good productive chat what's your response there i think it's true you think bill barr is right yeah because he's talking about the fact that the election was stolen it's yeah for sure so he says it wasn't stolen oh no no no yeah you you don't believe that no so who do you trust like trump trump's family i trust i trust trump you trust  ivanka yeah i do i think she's very smart and very intelligent let me show you this is what she said how did that affect your perspective about the election when attorney general barr made that statement it affected my perspective um i respect attorney general barr um so i accepted what he said was saying i don't know that's not you don't believe she actually said that did she say it on twitter it almost don't even look like her you don't think that it could not be it might be one of those what they got  clones out there these days you think that you think that was a that might be a clone yeah it might be an ivanka clone yeah i'll take my friend it's almost like you're confronted with it and your brain just does somersaults to figure out there must be some other some other reason she looks right she does look scared almost like she's she does she's been caught what do you think i'm confused a little bit ivanka his daughter her daughter says she accepts what the attorney general said which is that the election  wasn't stolen that trump lost well isn't i i mean if you listen to these people yeah it's a big lie and i'm fearful you're going to go inside there and he's going to keep telling you that lie we should go yeah i think we're ready to cut this off being confronted with uncomfortable information isn't easy to swallow but this crowd chooses to live by the immortal words of the bard rudy giuliani who said we've got lots of theories we just don't have the evidence especially when it comes to donald trump i believe  him and the military are running the country and that idiot that's up there as a puppet and obama's in the in the basement telling him what to do that sounds so crazy it's probably not true you probably don't even want to ask me what i think about 9 11. so god you got some theories for miles oh yeah and i read a lot of stuff but i know probably not all of it is true but enough that is true to know that we need change in this country yeah a little a little bit of in the pool doesn't mean you can't swim in it right  [Music] you

E102	https://youtu.be/1A6DpI_eA68?feature=shared	tomorrow is president's day a day when we honor our nation's greatest leaders and a perfect opportunity for morocca to tell us about the man considered one of the worst [Music] andrew johnson do some people come in thinking it's andrew jackson oh lots of times absolutely warren harding you want to shake hands with the hand that shook hands with hardly wow no survey of our worst presidents so millard fillmore's lips were on that teacup yes would be complete without our 14th president franklin pierce the only  president from new hampshire the funny thing is people from new hampshire don't really like him that much so joan woodhead is president of the pierce brigade we have a shirt that belonged to franklin pierce and you can see it says f pierce founded in 1966 to rescue concord new hampshire's pierce mance from destruction and to salvage the reputation of the man who once lived here he was known as a really good-looking president is that right yes he was harry truman thought he was the most handsome president we had in the white  house up until his time but why is harry truman the arbiter of good-looking presidents well i don't know that's the only comment we have from another president he may have been the most handsome band ever to serve in the white house and says university of virginia's michael holt franklin pierce had a great personality he was probably the most amiable president we've ever had even historians who were hostile to a remark about how pleasant and friendly he was at bowdoin college he began a lifelong  friendship with the future great american novelist nathaniel hawthorne hawthorne would write pierce's campaign biography it's probably not as interesting as some of his novels it's no scarlet letter no it's no scarlet letter thank god for that right injured after falling off his horse during the mexican-american war pearce a democrat served in both houses of congress a compromise candidate he won his party's nomination for the presidency on the 49th ballot we pulled you in 44 we shall pierce you  in 52. that is a great slogan yes it is pierce was elected in a landslide what good things did he do in office [Laughter] while professor holt composes himself let's return to the pierce manse where we learn about pierce's reforms to the postal service stamps were perforated under pierce right so that it was easier for people to separate the stamps yeah he's the postage stamp guy gary sparks is a volunteer guide at the mance he also helped ensure that american farmers had a good lease of supply of of wano  guano yeah the guano islands act of 1856 signed into law by pierce scooped up the rights to unclaimed islands rich with guano aka bird poop a natural fertilizer prized at the time by american farmers fyi midway site of a pivotal battle in world war ii is one of those islands so did this result in the mass importation of guano it resulted in a good steady flow of guano yeah so why then does pierce have such a crappy reputation because he played a major role in bringing on the civil war there's that  in 1854 pierce signed into law the kansas nebraska act allowing voters in the kansas and nebraska territories to decide whether to allow slavery within their borders negating the earlier missouri compromise which had prohibited slavery in those areas he made a terrible mistake in endorsing the kansas nebraska act and then jumping in with both feet on the pro-southern side in kansas violence broke out between pro and anti-slavery forces in a kind of preview of the civil war and the outrage in northern states was  so intense it led to the creation of the republican party he thought making concessions to southerners was what was necessary to preserve the union not even pierce's hometown could forgive him for the kansas nebraska act they burned him an effigy in concord because of his pro-southern actions pierce's political woes could only be matched by his personal ones all three of his and his wife jane's children died young eleven-year-old benny the last surviving one killed in a train accident traveling  with his parents just two months before pierce's inauguration the grief was almost more than first lady jane pierce could bear sort of went in the morning draping the white house and and black and really didn't come out in public until almost the end of 1854 to almost two full years into the administration after a single term in office pierce sought renomination but was rejected by his party he returned to new hampshire in 1857 to a home that later burned down only the front steps of this house  remain after abraham lincoln was assassinated in 1865 every house on this stretch except pierces displayed an american flag in commemoration of the great emancipator an angry mob assembled asking why pierce wasn't paying respect he mollified the crowd by explaining that he too was sad but that his long years of service spoke louder than the display of a flag franklin pierce died in 1869 at age 64. does franklin pierce deserve his ranking as one of our worst presidents i'm not trying to dodge this one i don't think  pierce comes down as one of our best presidents in any way but he wasn't a terrible awful person 	Leaning Liberal			Leaning Liberal	48
E130	https://youtu.be/ZEXzcEx6gg0?si=3jxzdDcUxYo236v0	traveled to the Del Rio sector of Texas that's where I spoke to a woman who shared her story with me she had been sex trafficked by the cartels starting at the age of 12 this is the United States of America and it is pastime in my opinion that we start acting the question is about the timing and the implication of you telling the story um The New York Times has this none of this happened during President Biden's Administration but that didn't stop the first-term senator from strongly implying that the president could have  somehow prevented it from happening so I didn't say a teenager I didn't say a young woman a a grown woman a woman when she was trafficked when she was 12 I was a victim it seems to me starting in 2004 I arrived in Mexico City in 2008 when I was already a Survivor were you ever trafficked in the United States no not at all no I was a victim here in Mexico so that was obviously super weird for a range of reasons a little alarming at times but it was also incredibly misleading so all in all a super weird  speech with at least one very misleading part about immigration sound familiar it should because it's a page out of Trump's Playbook I am shocked shocked well not that shocked I mean sure Emma Stone was good but this actress I believe was robbed at the Oscars President Biden's border policies are a disgrace this crisis is Despicable and the truth is it is almost entirely preventable uh was her talk on the border and just to contextualize that um she was one of the US senators who was involved in the bipartisan  negotiations to create a border bill um and she helped create the Bill and then voted against it when Donald Trump called on Republicans to pull the plug on the bill that they themselves had negotiated no sure Alabama Senator Katy Brit has had her feet held to the kitchen stove since her Gastly rebuttal of Biden's State of the Union Address I mean it was so bad that the furthest of farri right Talking Heads couldn't quite stomach it may God bless you and may God continue to bless these United States of  America um I don't I'm sure she's fan of her I'm sure she's very nice she embarrassed herself she embarrassed the Republicans and she embarrassed women it was a disgrace I was horrified by her performance and I really think that it's going to take her years to rebound again it did offer a segue to one of the greatest SNL impersonations of my time in my humble opinion performing an original monologue called this country is hell you see I'm not just a senator I'm a wife a mother and the craziest in the Target parking lot but on a  more serious note she didn't just fearmonger in a hushed horror-like voice she blatantly lied and misled those cocooned off from reality that was the target of said misinformation I traveled to the Del Rio sector of Texas that's where I spoke to a woman who shared her story with me she had been sex trafficked by the cartels starting at the age of 12 she told me not just that she was raped every day but how many times a day she was raped we wouldn't be okay with this happening in a third world country this is the United States  of America and it is pastime in my opinion that we start acting like it President Biden's border policies are a disgrace to be clear the story that you relate is not something that's happened under the Biden Administration that particular person I'm well I very I very clearly said I spoke to a woman who told me about when she was trafficked when she was 12 so I didn't say a teenager I didn't say a young woman a a grown woman a woman when she was trafficked when she was 12 well at this moment I would like her to get informed  a little more about the topic in that at some point if she wants to contact me to talk about the topic she can do so she can also contact people who have really gone through what she says and as Jen saki pointed out in her segment this past weekend sure we can all have a laugh at how blatantly staged it was but let's not look past how d dangerous these lies are especially when they're hidden amidst the absurdity of all this so that was obviously super weird for a range of reasons a little alarming at  times but it was also incredibly misleading I mean during that speech Brit shared a graphic story about a woman who had told her about being sexually abused over and over by members of Mexican drug cartels she implied it happened in the United States and she told that story in an effort purposefully to criticize the Biden administration's border policy but an independent reporter named Jonathan Katz did a little digging and what he discovered has gone viral on Tik Tok for good reason for one he found that the  victim had shared her story many times not just to Katie Brit privately including to Congress back in 2015 and the horrific ad she talks about act she talks about actually took place in Mexico and they happened when George W Bush was president so all in all a super weird speech with at least one very misleading part about immigration sound familiar here it should because it's a page out of Trump's Playbook look some Republican members of Congress basically entered the political world looking and  acting like this they ran as full-throated Maga Fanatics without even the pretense of waiting to govern they didn't evolve for others like Troy Nells and Katie Brit there's been a bit of an evolution and that tells us something important because even when you're elected as more of a mainstream conservative like Troy Nells and Katie brick and there are many others there is no incentive to stay that way because the magga movement is no longer The Fringe it is the Republican party and in order to stay in office and Rise through  the ranks you have no choice but to go full Maga and after the video spread like wildfire across the internet it has to be said that the majority of the discourse revolved around her terrible acting and blatant change of tone in her voice but journalist Jonathan Katz took a closer look at the gross lies that plagued her melodramatic monologue so you have no doubt seen this woman on your foru page at various points today that is Senator Katie Britt the junior senator from the state of Alabama who  delivered the Republican response to Joe Biden State of the Union last night it was weird but the part that was the weirdest for me the part that was the most off was this when I took office I took a different approach I traveled to the Del Rio sector of Texas that's where I spoke to a woman who shared her story with me she had been sex trafficked by the cartels starting at the age of 12 so I immediately had questions who was this woman how did she meet her how did she get her to tell her this story also she  seems to be describing something that had happened over the process of years she said that it started when this woman was 12 and she says that she's a woman now so seems that some time has passed how much of this happened on the border what country did it happen in did it happen before before Joe Biden was President Senator Brit right after that stated pretty directly what side of the Border it happened on or at least she implies it very strongly and we wouldn't be okay with this happening in a third world  country this is the United States of America all right so there's the answer it happened in the United States or did it so I looked a little bit to see if I could figure out what Senator Britt was talking about here and I found it pretty easily but this didn't happen when Joe Biden was President it happened 20 years ago when George W bush a republican was president and jto Romero didn't share her story with Senator Brit Brit tells it like she's like sitting by the banks of the Rio Grande like holding her hand  like getting her to tell her the story that she won't tell anyone else I mean that's sort of the affect that you get watching that video right this is a professional activist I mean she I'm sure she went through the things that she went through I'm not I'm not discounting that at all and she's clearly a a very brave person who has overcome a lot in her life but she tells this story in public this is her testifying in front of Congress in 2015 nine years ago almost a decade ago she this is what she does she goes around  and tells people this story and she did it for the senators in January 2023 it goes beyond misleading she said it in the piece of the video that you saw before she says we wouldn't accept these things if they happened in a third world country well they did and this is the Crux of it the youngest Republican woman ever elected to Senate and the first from Alabama to note Dawning a crucifix pendant hanging from her necklace willfully misleading voters to score political points it is indicative of this very party that claim to uphold  family values and the sanctity of Life while doing and voting against everything that not only helps preserve life say Social Security and medical one last question go ahead entitlements ever Bey on your your plan uh at some point they will be we have tremendous growth we're going to have tremendous growth this next year it'll be toward the end of the year the growth is going to be incredible and at the right time we will take a look at that you know that's actually the easiest of all things if  you look because it's such AIG will to do something if you if you don't cut something in entitlements you'll never really deal with will be cutting but we're also going to have growth like you've never had before you changed your your outlook on how to handle entitlement Social Security medic care Medicaid Mr President it seems like it it something has to be done or else we're going to be at stuck at 120% of of debt to GDP forever so first of all there is a lot you can do in terms of entitlements in  terms of cutting and but supports set like IVF I mean they don't even know what they stand for at this point a lot of these men in Congress don't understand what IVF is we need to have more kids we need to have an opportunity to do that and I thought this was the right thing to do but IVF is used to have more children and right now IVF services are pause at some of the clinics in Alabama aren't you concerned that this could impact people who are trying to have kids well that's for that's for another conversation they've  gotten themselves into this weird place on it but they've been pushing that they've also been pushing and sponsoring a bill Banning myth of pyone as well I mean they they are actively pushing banss on a range of contraception and and means of women making choices about their own bodies it's not changed in Congress to your point they're they're continuing to push it forward let's all enjoy the comedic relief of scal Joe's impersonation yes I certainly did but also let's take a

E151	https://youtu.be/qn023z6JLHw?si=YXrjpO2SrhEuMf54	how the hell do you not get more eyeballs you have a monopoly but you're not likable that is the lamest argument I hear because you go take the other side on uh uh take take anybody that you know you'll invite him over it's like okay take anybody else like well here's an African American gay military black whatever okay so here and there is that you know you got Rob Smith we just had him on right good you you know here's a great you know it's very hard to be an africanamerican woman conservative  because nobody wants to give Limelight hello Candace Owens the most viral face on social I think it's a and but but with Candace came what complete vitreal from the black community it is okay but my point is like I can only speak I guess from my own experience and of course being a public figure and watching it come down it's a it's a completely different ball game out there if you are right leaning now has it changed as far as there being more conservative voices out there absolutely but I know from my experience what has  happened by uh the difference between when I was just silent about everything maybe in you know 15 16 time frame up till then so when I started to speak out a little bit and then people I would say one thing about something random and they'd assume I'm a conservative you know and therefore evil conservative equals evil in the social media realm especially back then and the the the stuff that came with that the threats that came with that the sellout the all the things that I was called in particular by people with my skin color  so um I've lived that and the difference and again I know that if I had gone on that podcast with Jay Cutler you know two three years ago and and said sorry about my white my white mom you know I love you but I'm that one drop rule I'm or if I had condemned the antivaxers like I was saying things that don't go along with the left I was saying the opposite things and I know I would been celebrated if I had had the other opinion I mean you should see and and it's not again it's not about me I can  only speak on this based on my experience and when I compare also to my peers and how they're completely celebrated for having different opinions the attacks the threats people literally threatening to rape my daughters because because they're I mean and again has nothing to do with my kids but because I have more conservative viewpoints um I'm just saying it's a thing and um that's that's and I and I accept it and I accept it I do it is what it is and I had a choice because of the fact that it  leans more left and I don't know many people who would who would argue against that um then it's safer it's smarter business-wise to just stay quiet it if you don't agree shut up for sure 100% but but if I'm saying the other thing on social media you are out there and you're celebrated we're saying the same thing the only difference is Sage you're likable you're likable okay you're likable so but but to use that that as an excuse like when you're saying you know with you know uh uh how hard it is  for the left Candace ens is the most viral person out there but she's not working for like a ESPN or one of these places right but but but that's not the point though the point is it is a lot likeable is I is Candace when we spend that night with Candace off camera walked away loving her she's the at the highest level both of you but you're different we are completely different human being but that but that's the point but but you know what it was with Candace you know what I saw with Candace I saw a childlike curious uh uh a person  that wants to question everything that can be like I have a kid like that right obviously he's a kid she's a grown woman with three kids 35 years old established successful but I I liked the Curious poking what about this why this that's not fair how about this what about this do you think about this and then she's laughing and then you see this personality that that creative side with you I sat there I'm like I'm sitting in between shade and I'm sitting in between uh uh uh MC light you know like and I'm  you know but but but I'm not I'm talking about from the it's like this one's like talking and this one's like you know cherish the day and at the same time but we got it the Smooth Operator but still I want to listen to both yeah you know I want to listen to both I respect her again was so different she she wants a fight she goes and picks fights and we need people like that we we do to me and that's that she can have that and she's mastered that right um I honestly this might sound cheesy I don't know I'm an  army BR you know I grew up um just really super shy number one like this whole world I've entered into all these years ago was insane my parents watched me on TV for all these years and laugh they're like who are you and what have you done with my child afraid to talk and now it's like please stop talking please stop talking I am proud like I lead with kindness I I remember every year at ESPN every holiday season I exchange cookies with the janitors and the security guards and the Jewish one in particular because I like the rug the  that what wait rugala Adam Jewish what's the the cookie the amazing or the ruga the rugala like but my point is is not not try to no I just feel like kindness is everything and I I want to make everyone around me even if at the grocery store feel comfortable um to fault at times to be honest with you to be that pleaser to be the the connector and it's sometimes it's it's ended up being God like man what a waste of time that person's going to hate me anyway right why do you say you're completely different from Candace  then well she I think she enjoys uh the fight she wants this you know that's not what I desire in my life at all I like peace and listen I I'm not afraid to have a tough conversation let's go especially now I don't care cancel me whatever let's go um but I also as a journalist you know and it it wasn't about me it was about who I'm talking to in that conversation and learning about them and their story so I don't know that Candace she's an analyst more than a journalist you know what I'm saying um and they're very different  things I just um I'm we're different humans and that's fine I'm I'm a little softer I think in in many ways and also I don't have the knowledge that she has with all the and I don't want to with all the politics go for it there are there are many other things to talk about yeah especially yes sports but I haven't sat down one time and watched any of that programming because I realized holy crap there's a whole new world out there but I think you can do it and make good strong points and stand up for yourself and others and do it  with kindness that is my way of living and I think the only difference is like you you like you know who the enemy is like you picked yours Candice picked hers and there's multiple enemies and she's going headon to fight them you know what I mean and I get your I get the you know the sweet and the kind you have yours you know who they are look what they've done to you and yes and I respect by the way to hell with them for putting them what they put you I'm I'm so happy that you're strong and you've  gotten through it you've picked the you know who the enemy is your fight is a little different fight Candace has picked multiple fronts and she is attacking headon with all of them and I love that she's winning yeah but but but and I guess where you're coming yeah you're a different soldier on the battlefield of the same music exactly you I can listen to you know shade and then listen to Tupac and then I can listen to you know Foreigner and then Don Henley I'm totally cool everybody's got a different style of creating music  go ahead out well I I guess to hone in on this I mean where I was going with the Whitlock Stephen a thing was from a bigger perspective Whitlock I think he just talks politics now right I don't think he do he's on the blaze which is a conservative media Outlet his show is called Fearless talks about everything you know the the media landscape has changed since you joined ESPN that's kind of where I was going it's like I don't think Sports is that like pertinent in in the greater Gomen culture at these point in the Ze Guys  these days so if you like this clip and you want to watch another one click right here and if you want to watch the entire podcast click right here 	Leaning

E190	https://youtu.be/1EM9OmwtxtQ?si=Ico0bnDJACk5uiN1	[Music] hey guys how are you all doing it's your girl Cindy and I'm back again today with another G I trust you guys are doing great thank you so much for clicking to watch this video so this video right here just popped out on my for you page and as usual I thought I should bring this video here so we all can see it together let's check this video out if you're black you're not country I don't care like and and I wish I die in the Nic way but like I know you were raised in the country where your grandparents were I  guess your great granny and Grandpa but they was picking okay it wasn't CL keep that in mind they wasn't making money they was getting sold for ready he country guys I love it when I see videos like this it is literally a confirmation that racism is still here now some people will be like why do you always talk about racism racism doesn't exist anymore it is no longer here we are cool we are good the video that you just watched explains everything now from this white woman's video you could tell that it is written all over her she  was like she was at the point of crying because of Beyonce's album new album wow so recently Beyonce released her new album she met some country music which obviously white people are not happy with her like she is literally receiving loads of backlash like so many so many videos you know about it on Tik Tok now this video right here you know people are reacting to it I just wanted to see few Stitch she's obviously you could tell that she is not happy with black people like I said she was at the  point of crying yo you know she said if you are black you are not a country whatever but I just want to see some videos and of course I'm going to show you some random comments please check the SES out it is 2024 and people still act like they don't know what a digital footprint is they still act like they don't know that what they put on the internet it's not going nowhere it's going to be here forever people be on here saying the most craziest thing acting like you know it's not going to come back to haunt them whether it was  10 years ago or something current this stuff is going to be brought up again it's really crazy how some of these races are really losing their mind all because Beyonce made some country music if you continue to watch the full video this is a student I believe they said she's at IND Indiana State University and she's a nursing major you're going to lose all of that one once this gets the attention that it needs to get and people really start spreading this and it gets back to the university they  going to have no choice but to handle it in some way you're going to get kicked out of school you know imagine you becoming a nurse you know somebody that's supposed to treat people of all colors all Races all ethnicities and stuff like that but you have that type of hatred towards black folks that's crazy not only is the internet exposing the racist but it's also showing just how stupid they are because even if this is how you felt towards black people why in the hell would you come on the internet and say  this that don't make no damn sense country I really wish I didn't have to make videos like this I'm a music journalist and that's what I want to do is I want to spread music and spread joy and spread love and I Grateful Dead you know ain't no time to hate and obviously ASO Blandon from Indiana State University who is also a nurse in the nursing program I believe obviously believes that it's okay and I'm here to say that this is not okay so she is reacting to Beyonce's country song and as we've probably all heard it  by now hell even someone like me who doesn't like that kind of music heard it and thought it was a pretty awesome song You Know music doesn't know boundaries music doesn't know race you know I mean we've had black country singer I mean we one of the biggest country singers of Our Generation was Darius Rucker you know yeah Charlie Pride back in the day what about white people doing rap you know we had the Beasty Boys you got Eminem I mean you got white people playing jazz you got black people playing punk you got white guys playing  r& you got black guys playing metal you have races of all different walks of life playing whatever music because it's music that's what it's about it's about music it's not about what color you are what race or what gender or what your gender identity is or your nationality it's music it's music and she took it in a direction that it should have never been taken there one thing to say that you don't think Beyond say is worthy of doing country music because you don't think she's country but to go after her and attack  her with racism that is a whole other thing and this is what's wrong with Maga culture Maga culture has allowed this they have enabled this Donald Trump himself enabled young people like this person to believe that it's okay to be be able to go out and say things like this in a public setting hate hate speech that's what that is that is not first amendment that is not freedom of speech that is hate speech that is blatant racism and you can't get any more racist than that I mean her racism is a flat  out showing like she I mean she's pretty much I mean the only other thing she could have done was to wear a hood and robe but yeah everything about this is wrong and it breaks my heart this is where the young people are going that are in the shadows of their Maga culture their Maga families their Maga parents their magga instructors teachers they are allowing this and this is unreal and it's heartbreaking and I can't say this enough that there is no time to hate at all and I'm sorry that people have to  hear this and have to see this and be insulted by it but I can only hope that we will see asses crying apology video in the next maybe week or so or maybe she won't maybe she'll be even as proud of it as she is when she made this video but something tells me she's going to be apologizing and crying empty crocodile tears while the people that support that kind of behavior come to her rescue saying that she was misunderstood and that she was targeted we can't let this keep happening it's got to stop I'm sorry but if you're black  you're not country I just want to post this video this to think the mediocre Bunch for telling us who they exactly who they are the whole world is seeing that and you guys keep doing it to yourself and I told this one person today that the world is watching you guys and you guys are producing so we don't have to do anything anymore you guys doing it for us so I just think it's comical now and you guys are having this total meltdown and try to redefine everything in this country we taking your world away from  you I know we're taking your world with oh money I was getting sold for money gay country she said that with her whole chest posted it on Beyonce's internet and thought everything was going to be okay we're going to get back to her but let's get this out of the way country music would not exist without black people if you knew anything about the genre that you claim to care so much about you would know that hillbilly music which is what became country music was directly inspired by the spirituals  and field songs of black slaves that they have been creating and singing for hundreds of years but I'll go one even better the banjo is a black instrument the modern day banjo is a descendant of the West African instrument made from gourds called the acconting when enslaved persons were taken from Africa to America their instruments came with them for 400 years enslaved people created their own music hymns spirituals and field songs all with roots in African music accordingly in the 1840s the banjo was seen exclusively as a  black instrument it was unheard of for a white person to play the Bano no black people no country music but apparently OAB banson the Indiana State University student who made that video didn't get the memo and I've had a bunch of other students from that school reach out to me because she posted this right after that album was released and literally like what two weeks went by and Indiana State University didn't seem to have to say about it now the other day they did finally kind of say something  about it they put a statement buried at the bottom of the student newsletter that basically said we're aware of a video we're monitoring it does not align with our personal views guess what the students who've been reaching out to me that's not enough for them that's why you had protests on campus yesterday and I think you can expect a lot more until you take some sort of real action and make a real statement and draw a line in the sand that says if you're going to think and act this way you can find another school  to attend I'm sorry but if you're black you're not yikes Little Miss Assa woke up and chose violence when she said she didn't care she meant it she said I don't care what happens I'm going to say what I got to say about this country music stuff I don't care if it ruins my life my social life my dog gone reputation I don't care I don't like black people in country so I'm going to say it wow but this is how a lot this is how a lot of them think this this is why people are so upset she just said the  quiet part out loud I'm pretty sure it's a lot of people rooting for this girl right now just because of music I don't care what kind of music she said I'm going to talk my talk because of music yeah I don't think ather really thought this through or then again she might have thought this through she might have said I don't care what happens from here out I'm going to say this to any Community I want to say it to and then she said if you're black you don't belong in country damn that means she went on past Beyonce and  said anybody black you not country now if that's a person that don't care something yeah if don't care was a person it's Assa wow yeah I'm sorry but if you're black you're not country I hope you really realiz that she does not speak for all white women anyone who has any education understands that this country was built by black folks in the very white privilege that we receive today built from The Blood Sweat and Tears of people who did not have a choice to come here in the very root of the music that we listen to  today comes from black Heritage right down to the instruments we got to do better the fact that she was able to get this far in life without somebody correcting this thinking is alarming that's scary what are we doing as parents that nowhere along the line was this girl corrected in her thinking and she's going to be a nurse that's some scary the fact that she could be putting her hands on people in a healing modality scares the out of me we got to do better folks she should have been corrected a  long time ago about this mode of thinking and the fact that she wasn't scares the out of me and it just makes me want to work harder to educate my my children my grandchildren my nieces nephews friends I've never been okay with this kind of thinking I never will be okay with that we got to do better this this kind of should not still be happening I'm sorry but if you're black you're not country so this is this is why this is why you have the high INF mortality rates and maternal uh mortality rates  because uh there are people that think like this that are supposed to be caring for all populations regardless of where what they look like where they come from and what their idea of what they think they are but it it spills over into their work and that's that's it this is your answer if you wonder why are we have these disparities this is your answer for the disparities because people like this think like that they're in positions that hold the power of life and death to keep that in mind they wasn't making  money he was getting sold for money he a country she said that with her whole white aan chest she said that with her whole sodium sapen chest she made the video she watched it back because we all watch her videos before we post them she said yep that's that's the one press post so that it can forever be on the internet this video is going to follow her everywhere and she said yeah that's what I should do Bo cuz black people Ain't Country this is this is this is insane go collect your people [Laughter]  please my white friends hate when I say that cuz i' be like go collect your people they' be like no man that's not my people but yeah go collect your people what the was that oh my God racism you know white people y'all need to learn how to Let It Go like Let Go of the racism it's holding you back I'm tell you damn I'm sorry but if you're black you're not country if you haven't watched or heard of this video please go and watch the entire video not only of Asa Asia blandon's entire video which is  extremely racist but also that Creator is kind of filling you in on where she's at so I'm coming at this as a health care professional because pretty soon I'm like this close this close to getting my doctorate I'm this close to like treating patients without being supervised um and this really hits home for me because this person this young woman is in nursing school we've black women have been screaming about how they get treated in the healthcare field for Generations I mean we only need to talk about  Gynecology practices and how they were literally tortured to get some of the Gynecology knowledge that we have today so the fact that she is so blatantly and openly racist while also learning to practice medicine is so scary our country has one of the highest death rates for black women especially back black women giving birth so to see a health care professional somebody who is striving to be a health care professional to take care of people have this attitude I am terrified that someone like her is going to be working in the  health care profession and that we're going to have to see that person treating patients if Indiana State University has any kind of backbone they would absolutely expel her for this because no person with that kind of mentality should be treating patients especially someone who could potentially be treating people of color I I'm I can't stress this enough and I hope this is a wakeup call for her because you just hope I hope you just ruined your life I I you should not be working in the healthc care  profession you need to find a different job you need to find a different career path because this is not it this is not it for you you do not deserve to be taken care of people with zero empathy in your in your soul in your body and zero effort to actually educate yourself on people of color and especially black women I'm just flored and I really don't know how to stress this enough but for the love of God white women if you have not done the work and talked to people of color especially black women to to learn  about their their life their history their culture you need to keep your goddamn mouth shut seriously cuz otherwise this is what happens the audacity of white women really it's it never fails to shock me I'm sorry but if you're black you're not country in the immortal words of the Virgin Mary come again okay okay Shall We Begin country is a derivative of the Blues the origins of country music is white blues music and the blues was started by black people I'm pretty sure Charlie Pride is rolling over in his grave with that  I mean there is a host a whole host of black country music stars on this social media application I forgot what his name is but I love the song I said all i w let you run from this one I love that song I'm sorry um H uh uh uh pasty Patty um you don't look very country your goddamn self if we're just going off of looks Ray Charles made a country album I already mentioned Charlie Pride Darius Rucker he was a hoodie and the bowfish he's a big ass country star where do you get this man where do you get wh what  who listen this is going to be hard for some of y'all to hear okay some of you races have become very comfortable in enclaves allow me to be the Enclave breaker if you can do it it is open to the public and anyone can join then so can we you know there's no blacks in heavy metal the there isn't you you know there's no there's no blacks and rock sh the same way y'all feel about Eminem is the same way we feel about everything else I'm not a member of The Beehive I'm not sorry I'm not but you know what  Beyonce can take her ass into a recording booth and sing whatever the she wants and the beauty part about that is you really can't stop her she has more talent in the toenails as she Clips off of her toes than you have in your entire life and that's in the Multiverse like all the lives that you have in the Multiverse ain't got half the talent she does if you're black you're not country what the are you to how old are you five did you just did you just get here were you born in a coma and just woke the up what  are you talking about if you're black you absolutely can be country and rock and rock and roll and Pop I mean for sake John B is one of the nicest R&B singers on Earth and that is PAC they white you know how y'all drooled over Eminem oh my God a white rapper we feel that same way about everything else I'm sorry there is no such thing is whites only know mo there isn't I know you I know you want it to be you know hockey's white man sport not anymore I mean you would be outnumbered in rugby rugby a what  oh is that the New Zealand team oh and they're doing the haaka and that includes the presidency did did you think we we were just going to sit back and notice that these things are open to us and not do them no what y'all don't like the fact is that we doing better even Johnny Cash said that Johnny Cash Wayan Jennings Willie Nelson Chris Kristofferson Outlaw country do you think they would just restrict the to white people or you out to your  mind if you can sing and sing your ass off guess what Outlaw  country is right on top of it bring that in here see what y'all want is the Jason Al of the world I'm sorry Jason Aline doesn't have the talent that a lot of black country stars have you know what I'll put Jason Alan you can put you can put up Jason Aline with that trash in small town I'll put up Darius rocker that's an unfair match up isn't it cuz Darius would send his ass out of the Arena just face it pasty Patty it's it's okay it's okay we get it you want something exclusively for your own you have them already  whites only enclaves I mean housing and like that and this is the other thing y'all will look at small little trinkets we're looking at the entirety of the board so yes Beyonce made a country a country album and yes Beyonce is an R&B singer she's a singer first she can sing whatever genre she want once the problem is y'all don't like it that Beyonce comes in with more Talent than you have and again there is a host of black country singers on Tick Tock right now that are singing their asses off but y'all want fake ass  country the manufactured country the we like the boots of the police country y'all y'all want that manufacturing brand new goddamn uh Ford Super King Cab F-150 and brand new boots y'all don't want real country y'all don't want real country music because real country music has its roots in the people guess what the same things they seeing the the the hardships and pain and and joy that was in real Outlaw country music you can find in blue R&B hip hop real hip hop I'm my that y'all just mad that these people can come in and do  something you thought was exclusively yours better than the people you think belong to that exclusive Club you sound just like John Snider with that dogs pissing on tree hey John the beef is forever you and Juliana margoles have a beef with me for ever so let me explain something to you Beyonce could piss on your head and would do it 10 times better than all the talents you've ever had in your entire goddamn career but I digress don't be mad improve isn't that what y'all wanted a Melting Pot everybody just bringing what they  got and putting it into the Melting Pot isn't that what y'all wanted well guess what black country exists and it's been here longer than your pasty Elmer's Glue looking ass has been a lie longer go look up the roots of country music you will find the blues is there so get used to it I I suggest you get used to it guys honestly at this point I lack words I don't know what to say so I went on Tik Tok I saw loads of stitches videos white people you know bashing beyon for making a country song I just  want to know from you guys do you think beyon shouldn't have I just want to know because the

E201	https://youtu.be/KSOQr9h6cb8?si=ym2YMOlcWx3pvuMU	earlier this week I was in Complexo do Alemao which is a favela in Rio de Janeiro Brazil and as you can imagine I would much prefer to still be there because the weather was much better than it is here right now but anyway this is me and Alan and he is the founder of a Brazil campeão or embracing champions and their community organization they use boxing mentor in personal development and citizenship to inspire young people and reduce violence this work is remarkable because it was birthed from pain see Elan has lost more  than 10 members of his immediate family to gun violence he has lost even more friends and he has even lost young people that he works with and he has transformed this pain into his purpose and I was able to immediately connect with him as a result of this because I too had to learn how to transform my personal pain into my purpose when I was 15 my childhood friend Marvin was shot and killed a month before his 18th birthday and I was absolutely devastated by this and a year later I set up the forefront projects  where you fled social enterprise and our mission is to empower communities to live free from violence and we work with young people who have been affected by violence we work with them within the community within the education system and within the criminal justice system we deliver services a range of services programs workshops and mentoring and because our aim is to put young people at the forefront we also work with them to develop campaigns and advocacy so that we can make sure that policy  enables us to treat violence as a public health issue and we can deal with violence in a more compassionate and holistic way and I've been doing this work for six years now I'm 22 and this last year in particular has given me a rare opportunity to get a really broad and deep understanding of the root causes of violence across the world I spent the last month in Rio in Brazil trying to get a better understanding of the ways that violence impacts their community and also researching the initiatives that have been designed to  help reduce this violence over the last six months I've been to Glasgow Manchester been to New York Los Angeles and Chicago so that I can get some ideas of how we can better prevent and reduce this violence here in the UK and I've had the opportunity to interview more than 200 people for a documentary that we're going to release later on this year and I'm incredibly excited about this but the more I travelled the more I realize that there's just so much more that imil er than that which is different violence  is incredibly complex it is caused by deep social political economic and personal issues all intertwined and communities across the world are connected by the pain that we individuals feel we're members of our family when members of our community and our friends are murdered see these communities that are exposed to really high and frequent levels of violence can't really be said to be living post trauma we live in a state of perpetual community trauma there's not really any opportunities for healing because the  next violent incident is always around the corner and people who live in these environments enjoy extremely high levels of toxic stress and I can tell you firsthand that it's not only exhausting sometimes it can be absolutely paralyzing but it has also created a culture of desensitization violence is normal violence is expected and this is a huge part of the problem but we can only change this cultural norm by challenging it and to do this we need actions not just words see we tell young people that  violence is wrong we tell them not to carry weapons we told them not to attack other young people but what we don't do is show them that violence is not normal by providing them with the specialist support they require after they've been violently attacked see I've worked with many young people who have been violently attacked teenagers who have been stabbed multiple times who have never accessed any support and what we really need to do is explain to some of these young people some of the impacts  of this violence and how violence can be very traumatized how they might have increased levels of fear anxiety paranoia how they might have flashbacks of the incident and nightmares how they might have outbursts of rage and uncontrollable anger and that because violence isn't normal they might require some additional support to help them develop tools to cope with this pain and manage their emotions and if we're willing to look deeper we might find that we're actually working with children who have experienced so much  pain children who have lost many friends to murder who have had their sense of security and safety completely eroded and who have had very little assistance to deal with all of this pain and if there's not even adequate support in place for those young people that I've been violently attacked then what about the rest of us who were still experiencing pain because we've lost friends in this way my friend was killed eight years ago and I can't really recall ever being asked if I'm okay how I'm dealing with it how I'm coping with  him and this is how the coach of desensitization is created and please make no mistake about it the lack of support for young people who have been attacked by violence is negligence and it's not just children killing children it's not just violence in the community it's not youth violence it's also domestic violence is sexual violence and because the theme of today's conference is dare to defy I'm going to say what many people are not willing to say is also state sanctioned violence and it's institutional violence and what I now  know more than ever before is that the conditions that generate violence in our community are systemic and structural and although we must work with individuals providing them with access to support for growth healing and personal development if as a society we really want to achieve peace then we really must destroy the systems that are generating this violence in our community I'm really really disheartened because despite the fact that there's been calls all around the world for violence to be addressed as a public  health issue we're still seeing an over-reliance on this failing criminal enforcement model I was in Chicago when these young activists were campaigning against the bill of a new police academy on the neglected westside instead of investing in the city's failing education system and three weeks ago I was in Rio when the president the Brazilian president announced in an unprecedented move that he was going to give all of the state's public security responsibilities to the military and although this measure was  designed to reduce the violence that's been increasing there over the last few years everybody in the favelas that I spoke to told me the same thing drug traffickers create much harm in their community but the biggest threat is that of the police and the military because the drug traffickers although they're in a state of almost constant conflict they are also from the community whereas the police rarely distinguish between those that are committing crime and those that simply live there seeing them all as one in the  same and as a state rio de janeiro has one of the most deadly police forces in brazil and as a country brazil has one of the deadliest police forces in the world in 2016 in Rio police killed more than nine hundred and twenty five people that's almost equivalent to the amount killed by American police in the same year despite the fact that the American population is almost 20 times greater than that of Rio State and you might be thinking well what does police violence have to do with young people being  involved in violence in the community but if we understand the impacts of violence of exposure to violence on our health then we'll be able to see how these issues are intricately connected because young people don't feel safe young people don't feel their parents youth workers teachers can protect them and unfortunately those that are paid to protect and serve them rarely increase their sense of safety and there are many layers to unpack here to get to grips of what is really happening but everywhere  in the world I traveled I was able to appreciate that rise in violence is deeply tied to rising inequalities young black boys are disproportionately impacted by this violence but there also exists a range of pathological stereotypes about young black men and boys as well and I really have to say that institutional races is also a contributing factor to this violence now in Brazil those most likely to be killed by police or otherwise are the mostly poor black residents of the favelas they're almost twenty four  percent more likely to be victims of homicide almost seventy five percent of those killed by police in 2016 were black brazilians and in England and Wales there have been more than 1600 deaths in police custody or following police contact since 1990 and despite the fact that there have been ten unlawful killing inquest verdicts not one police officer has been held accountable and black people were disproportionately killed as a result of excessive force or restraint by the police in this country and over the last  four years I have met many families who have lost a loved one in this way and they have so much in common they don't have an opportunity to grieve because they immediately on this unknown quest for answers this battle that sometimes lasts more than twenty years they receive no support for bereavement in fact they just don't receive anything it's not just about deaths in police custody it's police violence it's abuse of powers corruption and it's about accountability see police violence paired with a lack of accountability  increases fear and decreases legitimacy and this complex relationship between young people their communities and the police is driving violence because young people don't fool they have a viable legal route to deal with their conflicts this lack of trust over time has created this culture of non-cooperation people don't provide the police with information sometimes murders are left unsolved and that just continues to perpetuate the cycle of violence as people take justice into their own hands the inner quality is deeper still young  black boys are more likely to be excluded or expelled from school more likely to be unemployed to be stopped and searched and come to the attention of the police to be arrested charged and sentenced to longer for the same crime as their white counterparts to have problematic doctrines like joint enterprise used in their cases to be labelled inappropriately as gang members to be treated disproportionately when they're inside the prison system and they also disproportionately are represented within the prison system  black and ethnic minority youth make up 46 percent of our youth prison system in this country that's almost half so racial trauma really does need to be addressed and more than this the criminal justice system is failing and we all know it is in a state of crisis there's no support for the mental health epidemic the drug trade is spiraling out of control people completely disconnected from any support system and have a lack of access to educational opportunities and violence and self-harm are increasing so by locking up  traumatized young people who would be better served by intervention is in in the community we just exposed them to increased violence and decreased opportunities when they leave see we don't actually need more punitive ism we need more healing to me a public health approach is a long-term approach and it's approach that has a role for everybody in society see I want everybody in society to be aware of the impacts of adverse childhood experiences the impacts of violence to be able to recognize the signs of trauma  I want training for community members in mental health crisis so that they're able to help the young people in their communities develop strategies to cope with this pain and I want adequate support for frontline workers many of us enter this field of work because of our own personal experiences yet very few of us have had any space to do with our own personal pain and trauma and we can only give the young people we work with what we have so we need infrastructure we need clinical supervision so we can deal  with the pain of our past and also the trauma that's created by doing this type of work because it's very taxing there is a mental health crisis but if we have better collaborations between the community and mental health services we can enable some capacity building to better enable us to be equipped to do all of this so for those young people that have been most impacted by violence they need long-term targeted holistic interventions thou gonna provide them with access to all kinds of support legal support  mental health support educational support and personal development support to you and we need to involve young people who have first-hand experiences of these structural barriers in doing this political work and campaigning so in order to do this it's really imperative that we have long-term funding resources and infrastructure for grassroots organizations that are creating campaigns creating platforms within the communities to enable these young people to have their voices and experiences heard to directly impact  political change and for young black people part of this holistic work is to acknowledge the structural barriers that they face to acknowledge the racial trauma that they experience and to work with them to enable them to develop a better sense of identity in some of these societies that are quite hostile towards them and in relation to the police we need Truth and Reconciliation we need the police to be held accountable when they make a mistake so that we can build a relationship with them that's based on trust and  transparency see I was in Newark and I had the benefit of observing a police and community trauma training police officers and members of the community got together they were able to discuss adverse childhood experiences they were able to discuss the impacts of trauma the last day and intergenerational legacy of slavery the impact of police brutality on the community as well as the trauma that police officers experienced during the course of their duties and overall the lack of support for everyone they connected as human  beings and it was quite inspiring to see and I think we need more of this innovative work that senses healing in order for us to move forward whilst the favelas of Rio are quite literally on the periphery of that city the peripheral and marginalized experience of the young people and residents there is not unique to Rio for moiré to Inglewood to Brixton to Tottenham to Compton to Flatbush around the world the state is not treating young people as citizens and to change the mindset of those young people most entrenched in  cycles of violence they need purpose not more punishment they need more inclusion not more exclusion and ostracization they need to have a stake in this society and they need to feel like citizens right now many feel like they have nothing to lose and if their young are not initiated into the village they will burn it down just to fill is warmth everywhere around the world that I've traveled I've asked the people have spoken to you if they think peace is possible and many of the young people involved in violence told me that it lay  beyond just simply them and their individual actions young people in Rio told me we don't need more investment in the military young people in Chicago and Los Angeles told me we don't need more investment in the police we need more investment in health we need more investment in our education services and we really need more investment in our communities the factors generates in violence are very complex so the solutions are also going to be complex and costly currently our government here in America and in Brazil demonstrate  that they are simply unwilling to pay this price to me those we have loved and lost will not be able to rest in peace until we create substantial change and to me real peace is not just the absence of violence rule peace is freedom see I was delivering a talk in a prison about six weeks ago and I wasn't surprised when I asked the young men in there who felt free and only one out of 15 of them put their hand up but when I asked who had felt free when they were not in prison only free out of 15 of them put  their hand on Nina Simone said freedom is no fear our children shouldn't fear their schools their communities being violently attacked or killed our community shouldn't feel fear that the police are going to abuse their power and not be held to account we need in order to be free to be able to live not just survive we need to be able to create change and when asked what freedom men Assata Shakur said freedom you're asking me about freedom I'll be honest with you I know a whole lot more about what freedom isn't then  about what it is because I've never been free I can only share my vision of the future about what freedom is she says the way I see it freedom is the right to grow it's the right to blossom freedom is the right to be yourself to be who you are to be who you want to be thank [Applause] [Music] 	Liberal			Leaning Conservative	54

E222	https://youtu.be/m0yN_WVD7y0?si=jsUrVri08nXTxyqI	but I wanted to not get past the free portion of this show on this news day without talking about this big news as well I mean of course we mentioned it yesterday but um the escalation of these massive campus demonstrations in solidarity with Palestine with the people of Gaza demanding that their universities divest from weapons manufacturers from contracts with the government of Israel and more um Colombia kicked this off with the encampment that was met with massive a massive Crackdown by the  administration with the NYPD um that was not enough for someone like Tom Cotton by the way the Republican senator who if you find yourself agreeing with this fascist freak as a liberal Zionist perhaps maybe check yourself and take a look in the mirror um he has called for uh the National Guard to be sent on these protesters which is he loves doing that he really does but remember when he said that in 2020 about black lives matter protesters and he took out an oped in the New York Times and it was met with  outrage where's the outrage here because well there's less so because the instances of anti-Semitism that you know I'm sure there are anti-Semitic incidents but they are by every account extremely marginal extremely marginal talk about that in the fun half but the headlines are dominating just those Mar the the are dominated by just those marginal instances nothing about what they're actually asking for um that's the focus and so you can have these like fascists like Tom Cotton saying these kinds of  things and there not be honestly the push back that's necessary uh uh to dis to to meet this moment of the biggest Crackdown on campus activism and Free Speech since the 60s um and I think cotton calling the National Guard invoking Kent State was clearly deliberate by the way by the way victims of Kent State were Jewish I think three of the four as our victims of uh Columbia angu and yales crack down disproportionately Jewish disproportionately Jewish the Jewish voice for peace activists um and Jewish  voice for peace specifically targeted by the administration um to cease their operations so what was amazing though was as these demonstrations continue to grow the faculty in these schools are demonstrating incredible solidarity with their students and it goes to show that our education system it's so deeply corrupt in ways I think that that perhaps you know we all understand it but this lays it so bare I mean Robert Craft pulling his money after shade davidai got his uh pass revoked I mean it says everything you need to know  it says everything you need to know that the administration is beholden and the administrators are beholden to these massive wealthy benefactors who get to determine the direction of these Higher Learning institutions and those doing educating and the educated are really not the priority and so this was just honestly a really moving display you can see here how many faculty members walked out of Colombia in solidarity with the rest of the students um because yeah it's not just crazy kids the crazy leftist kids who are  anti-semitic it's also the teachers the scholars who when you really do scholarship and you really understand the history of Palestine um the immorality of the Israel Israeli project is incredibly clear so of course Academia is going to understand this and they also understand what it means to stand with their students this was the crowd some they're you know cing down uh and this was a speech here too from another Columbia Professor addressing the student body Christopher Brown who's a history  Professor speaking to the students um about his concerns about Free Speech good afternoon I'm Christopher Brown professor in the history Department this is the first time I've ever held a microphone at a protest of any kind I'm not sure with that's something to take pride in or not but I say it because this is not typical for me I'm here because I am so concerned about what is happened to this University with where we are now and with where we are going Thursday April 18 2024 will be remembered as a shameful day in  Colombia's history the president's decision to send Riot police to pick up peaceful protesters on our campus was unprecedented unjustified disproportionate divisive and dangerous we are fortunate we don't know how fortunate we are we are fortunate that no one was hurt yes yes with that kind of shower for with those all those Firearms all it takes is one person to get nervous a table to fall a car or truck to backfire on Allen Amsterdam Avenue shots fired do you know police department does not belong on this campus except in G  moments and that show of course that show of force was a sign of [Music] weakness shame on in trying to show that they metant business what they showed was their incompetence we can keep it rolling that's what I was trying to say I want to say one other thing and that's about the Congressional testimony on Wednesday de and this is about academic freedom it's also about Colombia in 3 hours of testino the president of the university to my mind showed no pride in our Institution [Music] she said nothing she said nothing meaningful she  said nothing meaningful about the virtues of this institution of its people of its faculty of its staff of its researchers their dedication to Excellence their commitment to their students the quality the quality of the undergraduates and graduate students that we have here [Applause] the distinctive record of academic accomplishment and impact the variety and rigor of the scholarship which is happening here today the prospects for continued Excellency she didn't say anything about any of those  things she allowed slander of our institution to stand without rebuke Soviet style education no response all right in we got a good the whole speech is really worth it honestly so I wanted to keep it rolling a bit but um yeah I mean there were other there have been other uh professors from Colombia and barard who have spoken out essentially some that we've had on the show Adam tws has been great uh speaking out on on behalf of this of course you know RI k i I saw some people recognizing recognizing Pro professors that they'd  had at NYU who were being handcuffed and and walking out in by the NYPD in solidarity with their student body yeah as a NYU grad um it is a shame that this morning they're putting a a wall in front of uh that uh I don't know if it's I forget what the um uh building names are but yeah just build in the wall Very on the nose um and just to like put into context here's some other things about what are happening on the campus uh United Nations human rights office of the High Commissioner after 6 months of military assault more than  5,479 students 261 teachers and 95 University professors have been killed in Gaza and O and over 7,819 students and 756 teachers have been injured with numbers growing each day uh and I soulon uh said this on Twitter and this is my response to a lot of um I think uh people in media whether they're editors or um sort of rapid response columnists but soan says this I think stopping to do to policing or individual condemnations of random people at protests of a literal genocide is Gravely irresponsible and conveys a lack  of seriousness don't do it it is never worth it and any audience that demands it is on isn't on your side to begin with and that is how I feel about all of this is not worth the time if I was a if I was an editor for a newspaper I would put I would cover how thirsty Israel is for Jewish people to be victimized so they can use it to uh as propaganda for an ethnic cleansing c campaign way before I would be covering these incidents which are the responsibility of local authorities if there's anti-Semitism going on on campus that is  the job for campus administrators it is not a CNN news story it is appalling that this is used up any time when people are being like 18 more kids killed by Bomb Blast of the day it is pro genocide uh uh uh maneuver that we're seeing this is this is literally a psychological operation that so many zionists are drawing our attention to this they they responded and I mean these administrators and administrations basically responded in unison I mean coordinated there's this is a there are well-funded groups that  are basically sending out outrage uh threats to these universities and they have the ability the same groups that were doxing Harvard students and putting their information up on LED moving trucks outside of Harvard Square um there's a lot of money behind maintaining the war machine maintaining our relationship with Israel for ideological and then Al racist reasons and then also of course you know the is Israel is a weapons manufacturer and Trader and an outpost for us interests in the region um and a  destabilizing force which some people benefit from so there's a a lot there but the point here is that Academia and people interested in educating others and those who want to be educated are standing and raising their voice including many many Jewish students to oppose this um and it's an important moment in our history for sure and it's time to step up like all the professors I I've been so happy to find like you know NYU professors speaking out uh about this even ones that weren't at the actual protest but it's we really  need this right now this is an absolute emergency and we played uh um that Professor uh speaking at Spellman I forget her name um Rua Benjamin Rua Benjamin yeah um talk and like we need that across the board uh and this is absolutely one of these times where it's not time to be silent

E323	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1M6aO-MQq4	one of the most brutal concentration camps of the second world war was Dachau it was a camp which was first opened by the Nazis and during the time in which it was opened it's believed that around 41.5 000 people died within the barbed wire fences Dakar became the prototype for the concentration camps that were opened and it became so destructive but when the camp was liberated by the Americans there were a series of executions and killings of the guards who worked there the SS guards of Dachau were known for  their brutality and evil but the Dachau Liberation reprisals as it was known saw an American Soldier fire at the former SS guards and there was a huge investigation around this around the whole of that cow there were many other guards who had been killed in the camp but what was the true story has become rather muddled join us today to look at the ruthless executions of the guards of Dachau and as always to support our Channel please make sure to subscribe Dakar was opened on the 22nd of March 1933 and to begin with it held 200  prisoners sent from stadelheim prison and Landsberg and it was the first Camp to hold inmates who were regarded as political prisoners as time went on and the Nazis Stranglehold over Germany increased thousands more people were sent there including those who were considered undesirable by the Nazis as soon as the camp opened there were many deaths that occurred there and prisoners were being killed the prisoners were forced to conduct hard labor and it became a site by many as the scars were trained before they  were dispatched over camps to work The Prisoner entrance was marked by the infamous phrase arbite mcfry and the camp then became very overcrowded it was a site which was synonymous with execution as around 4 000 Soviet prisons of War were executed there by the commandant's guards at the SS shooting range near to the camp and executions of prisoners continued guards were known for their brutality and they would beat and brutalize inmates if they caught them not being productive enough and they would execute and Slaughter  with their bare hands executions also took place at roll call on The Gallows in front of the Camp's inmates and they would strike Terror into the hearts of the prisoners there was also a women's camp that opened in August 1944 but as a second world war turned against the Germans the conditions that Dakar went downhill badly the Germans started to move prisoners from concentration camps nearing the front lines to more centrally found camps nearer to the German Heartland and with this thousands of prisons were sent  to Dachau because of this there were many typhus epidemics and other disease outbreaks which cause problems and there were poor sanitary conditions coupled with a lack of food and water this led to many prisoners dying and it's believed that around fifteen thousand people died in the final six months of the war at Dachau in each day hundreds were succumbing to the conditions as well as those who were being brought to the firing range to be executed within the final days of the camp prisoners were still arriving and the SS  would confiscate food which was given to the prisoners on death marches and on the marches hundreds were dying the SS would dump the bodies in a Ravine and would force locals to bury them but on the 24th of April 1945 days before Liberation the commandant of Dachau ordered 7 000 prisons on a death march from the camp those who would not keep up on the sixth day March were shot but at the time of Liberation 200 people a day were dying Himmler would initially order no prisoners to fall into the hands of the  enemy and those from the northern part of Germany were ordered to be drowned in the North Sea of the Baltic was at Dachau the SS began to erase any information regarding what was actually happening at the camp but on the 29th of April 1945 soldiers from the 3rd Battalion 157th Infantry Regiment 45th Infantry Division who were led by Lieutenant Colonel Felix Sparks began to approach the huge Dachau complex in the nearby subcamps on their approach I came across 29 different train box cars which had 2 000  people's remains inside and it was clear they had been brutally exhibited and executed by the SS the smell of the rotting bodies in the sight of the emaciated dead caused a huge amount of discomfort upset and horror with the minds and emotions of the American soldiers this may have had an impact on the events that came later but as the Americans approached they ordered the asses scars to surrender but some fired upon the Americans as they push forward into prisoner areas the Americans far more bodies had been  dead for some time they had just been left in the open with no dignity for the soldiers and came across the prisoners who were alive and were dying but then the decision to surrender the camp was made and the majority of the SS hierarchy and the guards who had fled the camp had gone missing one senior guard Heinrich vikkar was slaughtered by the prisoners after the surrender and he was left in charge with 560 guards at his disposal was on the 29th of April the camp was surrendered and the job then came to try and save  the lives of those who were starving one liberated with state of the scenes as we approached the southwest corner three people came forward with a flag of truce we met them about 75 yards north of the southwest corner these three people were Swiss Red Cross Representatives Victor Martin two SS troops who said they were the Camp commander and his assistants they'd come here on the night of the 28th to take over from the regular Camp Personnel for the purpose of surrendering the camp to the advancing  Americans the Swiss Red Cross representative said they're around 100 SS scars in the camp who had their arms stacked except for the people in the tower he had given instructions so there would be no shots fired and it would take 50 men to relieve the guards as there were 42 000 half-crazed inmates many of them typhus infected he asked if I was an officer I replied I am assistant division commander of the 42nd Infantry Division and will accept the surrender of the camp in the name of the Rainbow  division for the United States Army but regarding the capture of Dachau Dwight Eisenhower the Supreme Allied Commander will issue a statement that said our forces liberated and mocked up the infamous concentration camp at Dachau approximately 32 000 prisons were liberated and 300 SS Camp guards were quickly neutralized but the circumstances around how the SS scars were killed has been debated and some historians have argued that the war crime was committed by the American soldiers one historian stated of what happened  that the Americans came on April 29th for Sunday work had stopped in the camp on Wednesday and an evacuation was being organized one transported four thousand prisoners was able to get away but the 42nd and 45th Infantry divisions covered the 40 miles from the Danube faster than the Germans expected at noon on Sunday the camp was quiet and the SS scars were in their post at the towers when the cry Americans went up a prisoner rushed towards a gate and agar shot him outside a single American Soldier stood looking  casually at the towers while the guards eyed him and the others who were two or three hundred yards away when the Americans opened fire the guards in the gate Tower came down hands in the air one held a pistol behind its back and the first American shot him in the next few minutes a Jeep drove up in it a blonde female War correspondence and a chaplain the chaplain asked the prisoners now cramming the gate to join him in the Lord's Prayer troops of the 42nd and 45th division so liberated Dachau in the afternoon on the  29th of April were fighting in Munich the next morning and by Nightfall had along with the 15 core of the three divisions captured the city there was a capital Bavaria and the birthplace of Nazism but what actually happened with the executions of the Dakar Liberation reprisals is best told by The Men Who were there and who witnessed it Lieutenant Colonel Sparks stated that he saw around 50 German prisoners who had been captured former guards and that they were then taken to an area which had been used for storing coal  the area was enclosed in an l-shape by a wall which was around eight feet high and it was found next to the Campion family the prisoners of War were watched over by American soldiers and a machine gun team who had their weapons primed as a threat for them not to move Sparks and Lefty's soldiers and as he walked away he heard a soldier shout they're trying to get away and their machine gun fire was heard Sparks quickly returned and he came across a 19 year old Soldier nicknamed birdie who was Manning the machine gun  and he had shot 12 of the prisoners and wounded many more the Gunner was crying was beside himself and Sparks later said if the incident it was a foregoing incident which could have given rise to Wild claims in various Publications than most or all of the German prisoners captured the Dachau were executed nothing could be further from the truth the total number of German guards killed a Dachau during that day most certainly did not exceed 50 with 30 probably being a more accurate figure the regimental records for that date  indicates that over a thousand German prisoners were brought to the regimental collecting points since my task force was leaving the regimental attack almost all the prisoners were taken by task force including several hundred from Dachau but there was some debate as to whether the soldier had been told to fire or how many German soldiers or guards were actually killed one witness testimony said that around 4pm in the afternoon he arrived in the yard where the Germans had been shot and that around 15 or 16 were killed and the  wounded were lying up against the wall some of the Wounded were moving and the surgeon and doctor did not know if any medical assistants had been called for meaning that the Americans were happy to let the wounded suffer and succumb to their deaths and Fates whatever accounts would go further saying that their Nazis were rounded up and were executed along with their guard dogs by the American forces in the coal yard there were further executions that took place and the prisoners would get their  revenge on the guards following the liberation one prisoner stated that the prisoners swarmed over the wire and grabbed the Americans and lifted them onto their shoulders other prisoners caught the SS Madden the first SS man elbowed one or two prisons out the way with the courage of the prisoners mounted they knocked them down and nobody could see whether they were stomped or what but they were killed The Prisoner feng shui such as a car pose are also beaten and were killed being attacked with fists and other  weapons one German guard was beaten to death with a shovel and there were favor incidents in which the American soldiers turned a blind eye to inmates beating the former guards to death one witness said that after an attack there was not much left of the saskar's face noticing the hate the prisoners held in their hearts but there was an investigation into the killings of the Gods of Dachau and Witnesses came forward about what happened further information came to light regarding more deaths with four German  soldiers being shot in a boxcar and these men had surrendered and they were given a coup de gras which was given to the wounded also further accounts about SS men being shot by the Americans in different enclosures were spoken about and the investigation resulted in possible court martials but charges were later dismissed it was considered a violation of international law but no one really ever answered the charges for it the Dakar Liberation reprisals as they were known were a series of executions  and killings of those SS men who were responsible for the huge suffering and evil that occurred inside of Dachau they were people who were responsible for the thousands of dead at the camp and they did little to help the suffering but the executions that were carried out around the camp were a sign of the anger and horror that the Americans held these men in it's likely that they were affected by the mass bodies and the horror that they encountered at Dachau and this is why some of them turned a  blind eye to the reprisals and killings with inside of the liberated Camp between 35 and 50 SS guards were executed thanks for watching to support our Channel please make sure to subscribe and once again thank

E325	https://youtu.be/_pMOG4k08H8?si=Qd7H3Nh1fnfPVIPg	welcome to Appalachia I guess this was the first night on my trip through Appalachia land and boy was it a memorable one I'll get to the whole what happened later in this video but it was seriously unbelievable maybe not to the people who live in this County though based on the interactions I had with the sheriff and all I think this happens just about every night yes the sheriff it was a long night now I've spent a lot of time talking about the problems of the country the terrible homeless issues out west the  violence in our inner cities and the rural poverty your idea of poverty is probably different from mine but out here is on another level I'm not sure if they know or even care how poor they are here and the poverty of the place isn't going to be the only focus but it's a big part of what we'll see here this trip would be three weeks of crisscross in the tiny mountain roads in some of our most isolated communities there are people back here who have never even left this region before some never will  see some big cities too well big for here and as we'll see it's a far different way of life in these twists and turns the values the culture and especially the way they view success you could say it's the most unique place in the country and we're gonna see it all during the dead of winter I guess this is going to be Appalachia without its makeup on [Music] what are the values out here the people me honesty uh respect if you do not respect me you ain't getting enough money because I tell you right now respect is not giving  hit his damn earns with me son I promise you I'm not a hard dude at all but now you will respect uh or else you respect my pleasure you get away from it you see I don't live in the luxurious life whatsoever but then you'll respect my house or you will get the hell out of it I don't care that's my family I don't give a if it's you I don't care who it is you will respect my family in my house or you'll have to leave or you'll have to take me out somewhere you know so that's just the way it is hello  that's Brian Baird he and his family live a mile or so off the highway in the middle of rural Eastern Kentucky cool guy makes lots of sense I was a little delighted when we first started talking we were just kind of Meandering around the rural back roads at Kentucky on a dreary winter morning and he just waved hello from his porch so we stopped and got to know him a bit Humanity comes for any politics in the Bible you know if you're not going to go up in Western or Eastern Kentucky and helped them little  fellows up first in bad shape don't go to your son of a is Rich and help that Bunch you see what I'm saying you help the people that's most down and that's exactly the way I see it now you know it was while talking to Brian that my whole mindset for this place changed and it was only my second day here I came into this place thinking I would talk to a folks that were a little Backwoods with a little hillbilly mixed in I guess Brian had that going but to me everything he said kind of made sense he  has just a simple no-nonsense outlook on everything I talked to a bunch of people when I was here for the month but Brian really stood out to me now you might be wondering why am I here regular folks probably don't get back into the middle of the woods in the middle of nowhere Kentucky well a long time ago I saw this article in the USA Today it talks about the poorest counties in the country of our 25 poorest counties nine are in Kentucky I was like that's crazy I need to go there and see what the heck's  going on over there so out of the nine poorest counties listed I picked the poorest one a place called Mccreary County it's right on the Tennessee Border more than half the population here is on Welfare and that's where my trip in Appalachian land would start at a place called Whitley City the Appalachian region goes from New York all the way down to the north part of the Deep South a lot of us have never been back here before on this road trip I'd spend my time in the middle of Appalachia land parts of  Tennessee West Virginia and right here in Kentucky if I were to come up here in the summer it would look way different it would be very green and blue if I came in the fall it would be very orange but this is winter time for four months a year it's very gray and brown some people might think this is beautiful I think it kind of looks spooky dreamy you could call this place mcdreary County the era appeared as cold and damp in the winter time they call it airish I don't like erish McCrary county is about a third the size  of Rhode Island but there's hardly anyone here the total population is 18 000 people and that includes the prison population which is 1500 inmates there aren't any actual cities here just places the biggest place here has 1200 people that's Whitley City that's where I am now I think it's so rural that I heard there's like eight stoplights in the whole County ain't no Costco's here most of the roads I drive on weren't even mapped out by Google yet [Applause] this area has kind of a Mystique to it  most people think everyone here is poor Backwoods and on drugs they think folks are white conservative and maybe uneducated I didn't meet everyone here but I know a lot of them don't make a lot of money and I know a lot of them are white and yes drugs are a big deal here pal they say this whole Region's 20 years behind the rest of the country sucks it's never been a big place but the people who lived here were doing a lot better before the coal industry collapsed that's just how it is all over the Appalachians I'm going to talk about  coal a lot in this series this area is coal mine closed in 1994 and without the coal mines they don't have much in these parts in terms of jobs there's teaching and government jobs and a decent number of factory jobs but that's just about it stuff's closing down everywhere you go in this part of Kentucky I lost count of the number of former gas stations or restaurants or Mom and Pops or whatever these places once were a lot of these abandoned buildings look like somebody just walked away and the  buildings just sort of slowly collapsing like a drawn out death on the side of the road for everyone to see only 40 percent of folks here who can work do the average person makes about ten thousand dollars a year one local business owner told me the problem isn't more jobs it's finding people who want to work a lot of the population here is either retired or can't pass a drug test some of the local factories are even lowering their own drug test bar so they can hire more people I guess you could say there's kind of an  excuse for the poverty here but not for the level of poverty they can do better if they choose to and it's like that all over Appalachia there's only two other counties in the country where more than half the populations on welfare and they're both here in this part of Kentucky where I am now 20 percent of people here don't have internet 25 didn't ever graduate high school seven percent went to college and guess how they voted probably the hardest red they could look at this map there's very few  Democrat areas in this entire state it's Social Security Disability Medicare and a lot of these people are unhealthy a lot of them are overweight or have cancer or diabetes there's only one urgent care and one dentist in the entire County so non-profits have to chip in and get folks care we have to talk about the drugs it's terrible here worse than you can imagine meth heroin pain pills fentanyl booze look at this it's an old apartment complex in town that had been condemned but people actually live here it's  missing parts of walls and windows and keep in mind it's below freezing this time of year locals say the cops are always running druggies out of here people who are squatting and making drugs somewhere inside this building I've not ever seen anything quite like this before and I've seen a lot of stuff but all over town There's houses where somebody's battling drug abuse or has just once again attempted to break their addiction you could say Southeastern Kentucky is a black hole that revolves around drugs  and church I talked to a business owner in town a guy named Mark Sewell he runs the Dairy Bar it's a funky throwback Diner that's been here since 1929. Marx lives in this County his entire life he loves it here but had to admit this County's in rough shape I've lived in McCray County all my life and uh it's undergone a lot of change a lot of it has not been good economically a lot of the change started to happen in the late 80s I guess it was Coal Mine closed they were the largest employer besides  the school system the school system is now the largest employer that's in the county um but the coal mine was the largest employer and of course they paid the most money and they were getting I think a hundred dollars a ton for the coal at the time bottom fell out of the cold Market I bought that out they shut it down guys went into work like for third shift and came out the next morning and they told them you know you know they were done so it was really quick and it impacted the county we still feel the impact of  it you know what you know I'd love to say that jobs would solve our problems but the bottom line is we experience in our industry here and it's it's Nationwide a shortage of Labor right now retirees that are moving here so they're not looking for a job and then there's a real mad drug problem in our area I think all about Malaysia is affected by it they tell me that a lot of the factories have dropped their standards as far as drug testing and things like that maybe they're not as strict on some  policies I can't verify that but Louise so I'd like to say yeah jobs would really help us but I'm not sure that you could feel very many jobs I don't know that there's that much available labor so it's it's a sad kind of a sad thing to to start thinking about and working through those situations and stuff okay so I guess this would be a good time to explain what was all about that hotel and that guy I showed you earlier so here's the situation we booked a room at a place called The Fair Bridge Inn on  Highway 27 in Whitley City I was told there were only two other hotels in the entire County and this was the quote unquote good one so I thought you know I'd be okay it can't be that bad boy was it bad the hotel's a freaking mess it smells like cigarettes they leave all the room doors open all day to air them out well I got in my room and I pulled the covers back and I saw my blankets one had burn holes all over it and the other had blood all over it I was like this is the most disgusting hotel room I've ever  seen well as you might guess I wanted different blankets so I asked for them and they said we don't have any more blankets so I just went into one of those other open rooms and found some blankets that didn't have as many burn holes or as much blood big mistake I guess this guy here I think he's security came rushing down and he told me he's kicking me out because I stole blankets he even called the cops my name is okay but you don't if you don't leave the property I believe you're gonna be immortal because now you're trespassing  okay leave the problem why why I'm just asking you why because you're a thief I'm a thief what did I see you say it again he's a Thief what a nice deal out of here man I took a blanket from another room because the blanket that I was giving get off the property if I tell you again you're gonna have a bigger problem on your hands I'm down you've already been asked once more than one what did I do get off the property what did I do okay he's a thief I'm a thief what is your name what's your name it's  Jack of all trades keep bothering me man please keep bothering me I'm not bothering anybody there you are Pricks like you that we got to deal with on a daily basis don't think you're not being recorded on all my cameras I'm gonna post you bigger than too buddy it was my first night in Appalachian land and I was like damn this place is crazy first person I met when I got here was seriously troubled the sheriff's department showed up and they were super nice guys they told me they have to deal with this type of  stuff every night in this County I felt bad for the sheriff deputies that showed up and I could tell they felt bad for me one of them told me they tried so hard to get folks like us to come to the county and spend money and then this happens it just doesn't make sense they said there's a lot of murders out here but there's a lot of property crime robberies drug crimes stolen cars that kind of thing but it doesn't feel dangerous to me here I didn't feel threatened taking back roads until they ended up in someone's  front yard and that happened a lot foreign but this is how they want to live out in the country away from you and me the heart wants what the heart wants it was while Meandering around these back roads when we met that old-timer Brian we met earlier his family's been living in these hollers forever now he calls himself a chicken fighter which means he fights roosters we drove past his field where I had all these roosters and cages everywhere unbelievable this is all way out in an old beat up road miles from town  and town isn't really a town it's religion now I'm a rooster fighter you can tell exactly what I do I'm rushed if I have been all my life I want Rhythm now I'm tired I've been harder for five years getting too damn old for him can't take care of them like I want to that's hard somebody do it but uh hey I've always told everybody you know chicken fighting the man that puts the most in it and feeds the best and does 99 of the time you know where religion to me is the same thing is that chicken fat not the same thing  I'm saying to illustrate if you use common sense in either one of them you'll do better than average and I says people go out there working more roosters they'll do a push-up rooster I've never seen a rooster go through the yards going up and down you see what I'm saying he walks straight back and forth he does knock side to side on that bull crap he goes straight if you want to build his leg build him straight that's his natural movement and religion you keep in your heart in your head you'll still will do better than average you  know don't listen to the man don't I don't care what the preacher is preacher he ain't taking you to help Jack you know uh religion will take you straight to hell you need salvation if you want to have them that's a fact you know there's a difference in religion and salvation yeah so it's a one-on-one deal that's it you can't blame Brian for holding on to his land so long sure is cheap out here the average homes are 80 000 each rents 500 bucks a month the only people who should really struggle are those who refuse to work  are the ones on drugs the country is very fired up about politics and church the biblical apocalypse is right around the corner Joe Biden is the demon there's churches everywhere here on the main roads tucked back in the hollers I popped by one church at the end of a dirt road and I met some kids who were there with their dad who's the pastor of the church how important is religion up here in this part of Kentucky well around here it ain't there's there's a lot of people claims religion but a lot of them don't  got the real thing but in in this part there's a lot of churches around here several actually one actually around the road and then there's there's several more but how important is it I don't I don't know how important it is to them but I know here and for this church here it's our life and that's how important it is here like actually I said the pastor of the church David Allen he's sick right now but he's trusting God for his healing ain't been to the doctor one time and actually last year three different  times he was just about dead he said he he well he was he was dying and the Lord came through healed him and that's how important it is for us do you think people don't have religion as much as they used to in this country no no they they ain't they don't got it nothing like they did and all you gotta do is look look and see and it's that's how it is do you think that's bad horrible because they're on their way to hell and we I we try our best to save them but if they don't listen you can't do nothing  there's some nice parts of the county it's not all beat up driving around you see little pockets of newer and more clean this neighborhood we're in is near the County's Golf Course homes here in the 140 000 range every now and then somebody new moves into the area an older person who's retired who wants cheap land and word is good homes like this are hard to come by in this part of Kentucky they're just not building homes like this much around here anymore and there's not a lot of land left that's  not federal land to build on this was the fanciest home I saw in the county it's close to eight hundred thousand dollars which means it's about 10 times more expensive than most of the other houses we've seen so far but as you can tell by the way things look in most of the place a lot of people are leaving town there just aren't many opportunities anymore foreign I saw a lot of random stuff driving around this County for two days wild dogs were everywhere you turned down a gravel road and odds are a small pack  will chase you down for a while you feel bad for him but I think they know what they're doing I haven't seen very many trailers with chimneys but I saw a lot of those they look really dangerous I saw a house built into the side of a hill never saw that before the prices in town really catch your eye this is the Dairy Bar menu 3.99 small town salads for the win and look at the prices on all their fried stuff um look at the prices for booze in this County this is the Whistle Stop the local joint in town 225 for a bottleneck  a domestic Suds my kind of deal and they have lots of catfish on the menu not my kind of deal and there were two knives just randomly sitting on the counter of the place that's pretty Appalachia I have to say everywhere you go here you're reminded that you're in Appalachia land it's a slow pace with a lot of strong values did you know two-thirds of people in Kentucky say they're religious I thought it would be higher than that Mappy there's churches just about every Mile in this part of the country I think  there's just nothing else to do for fun here church is probably their social time just look out for the meth bellies wait what yeah it's pretty beat up all over but it's the trash and falling down that makes this whole area seem bad the abandoned cars and the rubble this Road's on the way to the Cumberland National Forest which is right in the middle of this County look at how they've trashed their own national parks there's trash all over the side of the road here I wondered what tourists think is a  drive up here to look at nature I bet they think they're all a bunch of backwards Hillbillies Rune in the place like this here's what the Cumberland Falls looks like in the Cumberland National Forest they say this is the Niagara Falls of the South I also hear this is the only waterfall in the Western Hemisphere that makes moonbows McCrary County Kentucky is definitely one of the worst places you can live in the country when you measure poverty and drugs and health I hear things are slowly barely changing  for the better since the initial shock of the coal industry left it's sad to see all this at least from an outsider's perspective but if you find a way to look past all the rundown I think a lot of these people ain't got it so bad it's the simple life they live it's cheap there's no traffic there aren't ambulances blaring all over there aren't bums here it's not dying fast the whole area is just sort of slowly fading away from the rest of us but no matter how bad things get these folks won't ever leave these mountains  not on your life first and foremost you must take care of family I don't give a rich where the you're doing in life the family comes first you know yeah not you by no means you put them first and then whatever you can do you just you know you take care of their needs and if anything left you take Heroes up that's the way I did now that's just the way I think that's the basic rules of life you know when I had them kids my obligation was to raise them and you know and that's that's what I thought  and that's the way I do things yeah so religion I know everybody goes back to religion one point another uh I do not go to church in any way don't have anything against it and anyway but uh I feel it's a one-on-one situation I'm not gonna push my religion on you and you sure cannot change my values in any way you know I'm setting my uh life in 63 years I'm saying whatever I'm going to do I've done and whatever I want to do I want to do I don't care what you say what the preacher said I don't care yeah you don't make no  difference no I think you uh start dying when you're born you know and you live every minute between there the best you can what about politics how what are politics like out here everyone thinks it's Trump land conservative it probably is well for the most part not I'm not pro-trump by no means everybody got their mess-ups and he's no perception to the rule you got them I've got them every one of them but for the most part are country-wise we was a whole lot better shape then than we are now you know we had a lot  lower gas prices now and as far as getting someone to work now it's over you cannot get nobody to do nothing uh it just don't happen you know they just win the and I've got nothing wrong with Stephen check I had no problem with them helping I didn't but it hit Run America they did when they shut the places down here here hitting rooms absolutely hit me there you know it's always a free hand down give me a hand and you may be a hardcore Democrat I'll not fall out for the politics man listen basically  I don't have a problem with democrat or a republican either one but there is no such thing as a Democratic Republic Party no more because it's all about I either get what I want I'm not giving an inch you know if me and you and her is in a debate and you want ten thousand dollars for whatever you've got your hand returned and I want to get five we got to meet somewhere in the middle it's not that way no more you know you either get the ten thousand or I I guess it's over it's it's a battle and it's all coming to the end that's  exactly what I mean that's what it's all boiling down to the end so what do you think about big cities of all big cities crime traffic cost of living attitude they're trashed homeless people everywhere I mean I've been to a lot of big cities this is far different than that how do you feel about the way the inner cities and the big cities are with all the that's going on well I don't know a whole lot about that you know that's what I see on the news and read but uh well I'll go right back to what I'm  talking about in Eastern Kentucky the veterans should be took care of for any slavovich in the world now listen they should not be one veteran in the damn country nowhere sleeping in the cold unless he chooses to now listen that's his choice that's him you know there's a lot of people who likes it I mean a lot of people does not want the responsibility taking care of that house you know they just don't want to try responsibility they want this you know and I understand you know when you come back to it's all messed up a  bunch of them I had a bunch of friends a bunch of them I mean was terrible but I think you're gonna take it just like I said I think you should take care of the people as a need before you worry about the rich person you know uh that's just the way I see it you know the rich person to take care of his darn self and uh the real poor people they need it you know so I mean that's basically I can't I can't say a whole lot about big cities so I've been in Indianapolis and a couple of them you know but  35 40 years ago it was nothing like that I've been married 42 years lived here 40 years so Everything's changed since then you know how it is but you're making a lot of sense man yeah I don't know about all that but that's so that's my beliefs you know what I'm saying uh more sense than you I mean a lot of people would think yeah you gotta go to big cities to get all the knowledge about how to run the but out here you guys got it off just simple sensible thought you know what listen I say that it's a bad  illustration I believe your own life and uh it's kind of laid back you know and for the most part everybody's cool people be around you've got you know you've got exception to every Rule and so it's just been neat for me in my whole life you know I've been here my whole life yeah done well in life so don't look like it but I've done well you know tell me how you've done well yeah tell me you know I mean I mean you know you just you just uh I've got my grandbaby's place and all that you know and so  basically my life's done you know I mean after I've done everything I should do I think so I'm ready to go one day I posted you know I don't rush it by no means I'd like to live another 50 years but now I know that's not possible because I'm 108 now it seems like but you just do the best you can every day you know just take with a ground salt hope you do good that's how that's just it yeah so you know we have some factories which we're thankful for uh but they don't pay you know like the coal mines did but  anyway um that was probably the start of the big decline in my time uh we used to have some new car dealers here uh there was a Ford dealer a Chevrolet dealer even earlier than that Dodge so you could buy a new Dodge car here we had movie theaters uh not one in Stearns one in Whitley City years ago shopping had you know no chain stores but they had mom and pop stores clothing stores and that kind of thing after the mines closed it just kind of dried the whole thing up and as those people retired there was no one to come in and  you know go on with a business or anybody really had the means to continue a business in a county where it's you know pretty depressed our population has increased some but it's it's a lot of retirees moved back here people that left you know to go get a job somewhere else and some of them have moved back and then there's in the last couple years I think I think covens and so on there's been a lot of people that's moved here that really didn't have any ties they were just looking for a place to go that  was small I guess kind of off the radar you know so to speak that's the big changes that I've seen as far as the Dairy Bar goes we're thankful that we still have a thriving business here there is there's so much good and to be quite honest I don't want to be anywhere else you know I've traveled a little bit I'm not a world traveler but I've traveled a little bit I was younger that perhaps I'd want to go somewhere else but at this point in my life I'm totally satisfied to be here and especially since  a lot of stuff you see going on in big cities crime and covid really started folks moving around and so on and it made me really thankful that I am where I am as far as the people that are here in my opinion they're the salt of the earth you do have you know an element that you might not want to deal with but by and large our people are good people are you looking to move and need advice I do Consulting that's right I'll sit down and talk about where the next perfect place for you and your family should be  I do

you know i made the decision to go into the pub to get the drink to pay for it and drink again to drink again and drink and drink and drink i made that choice i made the choice to go to the kitchen to get a knife to attack the person because i didn't have a solution it just didn't occur to me i wish i had it didn't rarely seen little known the world of forensic psychiatry is a  mystery to most of us we deal with the most complex and risky individuals in our country work in one of the most dangerous parts of the nhs treating extreme paranoia i've said nicely please please [Music] on a daily basis if i don't change i'm going to drink and if i drink i'm going to re-offend these patients have committed some very violent crimes i set about carving the geezer up with a razor blade you have to learn to live with what you've done and most are here because they've been judged too mentally ill to be in prison  there's a long history of violence when he's psychotic he's really been very threatening very aggressive indeed but how do you contain people who pose such a threat to the public can you make them well again i've just got you know showing you know daddy's not angry danny anymore he's um he's getting better and is it possible for some of the most dangerously unwell people in britain ever to rejoin the outside world they want to see me go out there because they know what i'm like outside i can understand why certain elements of  society just don't want to give people like me another chance the bethlehem royal in south london houses 120 mentally disordered offenders a bed here costs four times more than one in prison so we're in fact really working with patients who are mentally sick and have been involved in serious crime we're not talking about minor offending but major acts of violence such as homicide serious sexual violence and patients are complicated further by having very complex emotional and mental health issues  250 staff work on these wards and their aim is to reduce the patient's risk to a level where one day they can be safely discharged [Music] majority of offenders will be discharged at some point but the time taken to achieve that discharge might be one of a few months through to even perhaps many years even a decade james came to the bethlehem royal from prison two and a half years ago for the last month he's been allowed to venture outside the locked doors of the wards this is river house this holds about eight wards six to  eight wards all different uh illnesses cute and you're all different you know what i mean yeah you know you've got to be uh on buddy you're not a man yeah gotta be on a tag tagging system for like uh i don't know six months to eight months you know it's baby steps at a time but it's all progression you know a couple of months could be up the high road with an escort you know looking for voluntary work in the community you know the words my oyster is what i make of it [Music] james is serving a life sentence for  committing a violent attack while in prison he's been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and has been undergoing long-term psychological therapy a lot of this is like you know therapy work folders and folders and folders and this is all about my history where i've gone wrong you know what i'm saying yeah it's just working you know he's just working through things to uh help me improve my chances of uh making it out there do you know what i mean yeah so he's completed the main treatment  program on the unit although he's made quite a lot of good progress and he certainly has been involved in quite a few incidents in the ward um been verbally abusive made threats to kill um really quite serious incidents i'll give you i'll give you a shot when we need to lock it here and i think the difficulty that we have is trying to reconcile the fact that he's saying he wants to change and that he's keen to continue to work with the fact that he's continuing to engage in that kind of anti-social  behavior lovely mike cheers anti-social behaviour to me i'm 45 so let's just say i've had the age of 15 i've had three decades of it that's not something you can just discard and put away overnight room weren't built in a day you're not mean yeah anti-social at the time behavior to me was my identity it was about who i was you know what i mean yeah to put it down and just say well i'm not gonna i'm not gonna be this way anymore it don't it don't happen that way do you plan to get out of here yeah absolutely you know  what i mean yeah uh this this this painting here which i finished a couple of days ago so there was two titles the first one was been double in anguish like a tree in a storm or uh sometimes a river and i opted for sometimes a river it was it was easier to manage john has been in secure institutions for 22 years growing up in zimbabwe he had corrective surgery for a rare birth defect i mean a lot of my friends just accepted me but there was a minority who didn't they made it clear that i was different  unusual strange and that played on my confidence and my self-esteem really you know and one of the ways that i thought i'd combat the feelings that that produced later on was to drink and that that just magnified some of those feelings that i already had john has a personality disorder and when he drinks he can be unpredictably violent this is a timeline so these are historical events significant events in my life that may have uh had a psychological emotional impact on me in some way this is uh this forms part of the  violent reduction program um so these are highs and lows um so a low for example would be as a child being bullied uh some [Music] some sexual abuse and um this is my index offense it's the primary offense i stabbed a man several times i spent the night drinking with him i was drinking out of a can in his lounge and i and i said could i get a glass from for the um for the beer and he directed me to the kitchen and when i went to the kitchen i started opening up the cupboards but i completely forgot why i was in the  kitchen and i saw a block of knives and i came back out with a carving knife and i uh and i attacked him [Music] they can do a huge amount of therapy understanding their offending history their offense their risk profile but at some point you've got to test it out with reality you've got to be outside the hospital to see how you manage with community life the stresses the challenges of being in a big city like london today john is facing those challenges after decades inside he has permission to go into the local community  without a member of staff it's really quite exhilarating [Music] being unaccompanied being on my own [Music] it feels quite liberating [Music] everyone's fascinated by the concept of extreme violence murder mental illness [Music] the sort of terminology that the news of the world always used was the stop phrase scum of the earth it's a very powerful statement isn't it scum of the earth uh they're they're very conscious of that our patients obviously want to return back to the community in a safe and  successful way i suspect often the public would wish they stayed here perhaps indefinitely most of them would see them as sick dangerous and nasty individuals we have to in many ways persuade them that what we're doing is safe thought through and very responsible [Music] i might experience anxiety and i do every day but there are varying intensities and depth to that and most of the time it's just you know it's manageable it's just you know it's okay i'm okay if i'm okay you're okay we're okay we're all right random things  will happen that's life it just feels it feels unmanageable that's me my mind playing tricks on me so i don't engage with them stick to my plan what everyone else is doing that's their plan my plan is different my plan is looking after me one of his problems is that when things don't go according to plan or when others make mistakes or when things are unpredictable it gets very stressed very anxious and in the past he has coped by drinking alcohol taking illicit drugs that would lead to risk of violence to  others when i was a child and i did something wrong i was very aware that i've done something wrong but you have that sense of i'm in trouble and i've been i've been in situations where i've had a sense of being in trouble done something wrong or panic that i have to phone somebody and invariably what i do was i phoned the police john phoned the police in 1998 after he stabbed a man he'd been drinking with he was found guilty of attempted murder at the time when the police officer arrested me asked me how many times did  i stab and i in my mind it was once my mind had completely censored the whole event and that it seemed like it was only once but in actual fact it was several it was 13 times hello ugh it's helen brousseau here tony is he up and about he was supposed to be ready i think i've got to go through his risk assessment hi mike can you just do us a favor is tony is he out the bethlehem royal hospital treats mentally ill offenders who pose a risk of violence today ward manager helen is getting a patient ready to see his clinical team  they want to decide if he's safe to go outside the hospital on his own [Music] oh this happens tony are you decent hi do you remember we spoke about it yesterday it's it's quarter past two in the afternoon just let's get up and about as i don't think it looks awfully good you're spending all day in bed really so come on let's see some action all right lovely thanks very much mike that's great [Music] tony's been in and out of secure institutions since he was 18. he's been diagnosed with a personality  disorder and paranoid schizophrenia tony's got a risk of aggression and violence um when he's unwell and when he's unwell he does tend to use illicit substances and so when he uses these substances he becomes even more risky he has a attack staff on the ward and then when he's out in the community previously he's attacked people when he's been unwell and under the influence of substances oh well we should all have a fight i'm not glad we've got a total of 36 convictions since 1997. that's quite a high number  oh yeah yeah yeah [Music] what's as well going through it [Music] he's still quite a risk his parents are quite worried um about him absconding about the risk of violence and aggression the risk of him using drugs on the outside and it's only fairly recently he's been using he's been using illicit substances here on the ward tony's recovery is at risk from the legal highs in cannabis that despite tight security are smuggled onto the ward by patients on leave tony has a great difficulty in understanding  the dangers of drugs and of how those substances change his mental state and turn him into somebody who we would consider dangerous to be fur with tony he has been trying he's certainly making good improvements but i think it's just a little step too far to give him one escorted leave at the minute you could have done with a shave but never mind so why are you languishing in bed for got no toothpaste on nothing well i will get some we shall organise it why not didn't you tell me that yesterday he has no concept of  the fear that has been engendered in his family um and people around him when he becomes angry or aggressive or violent let's see him then and see what he says so our job is to try and help him understand what what he needs to be before he can get that on escorted leave first of all what i'd like to say is that in general i think we're all agreed that you've been doing really well and we're all working towards you eventually being discharged from hospital but i think it's a little bit too soon to think of  unescorted the best thing that you can do is carry on with your medication carry them with the groups and the biggest message i can give you is to stay off the legal highs or the drugs yes yeah yeah all right um yeah i've got to pull on through i've got to continue not to i've got to not fight no one um i've not got to get myself into no bother keep myself to myself mind my own business and get along slowly but surely yeah and take it in respect that the people around me are trying to help me and i'm trying my hardest to cooperate  but there is times i am turning against the staff and thinking oh well should i do what should i do what should i do but when it goes quiet and no one explains to me i don't know what i don't know how to continue you know stay off the camera yes that's right all right well done thank you all right cheers have any of your patients ever gone on to commit serious offences again they have um and i think that's one of the most difficult parts of the job my risk assessment is clearly not an exact science and  we don't always get it right and on very rare occasions patients have gone on to commit other offences so why take the risk of letting these patients out at all dr campbell i think quite strongly that they should be given that opportunity to address their very real mental health problems rather than just pretending that it's not an issue and keeping people in prison for however long it would need before the risk was reduced which in many cases would be never you ready yeah all right let's go mate  we're gonna go over to the place because of his sentence james's first trip out of the hospital must be approved by the ministry of justice so for now he can only look at the outside world from the perimeter fence i try and go up there a couple of times a week just to sort of uh [Music] prepare myself really for maybe in a couple of weeks when uh my community leaves granted and just familiarize myself with uh just the comings and goings of uh life outside these grounds you know what i mean yeah  a world carrying on you know what i mean yeah well going getting by without me in it [Music] a lot of growing up mate over the last couple years but you know it's been really hard hard actually facing up to that i used to make excuses for [Music] 16 years ago while serving time for armed robbery james made an unprovoked attack on a fellow inmate he was given a life sentence trying to fit in into a high security status jail feeling totally out of place i was trying to sort of uh make a point that you know i'm not here to be bullied  by anyone i went in a cell with another inmate you know what i mean yeah he punched the geezer up you know what i mean yeah i set about carving the geezer up with a toothbrush and a razor blade i'd have died in a system i wouldn't have been released you know i i lost everything in the process you know my ex-partner my kids loved them dearly you know i mean yeah but uh you know i was no good to them mate i was i was out of control mate you know what i mean yeah i was a villain i was violent why would you want to be involved in  someone like that and now i'm here i've been in two and a half years i'm on a journey to try and uh build someone i'm proud of and i just don't want to go back to an old lifestyle mate you know not just get out there i deteriorate crash go back to square one again i can't do it i can't afford to do it you know what i'm saying yeah i'd rather take the solely approach and i'll get it right this time you know what i mean yeah [Music] so what have we done today to get you ready to go out um i've had a shower yep um i washed my  clothes last night that's it um i've washed my hair yes i'm good looking check check mic check check one who's on the mic the version it's me madam enemy i'm on the mic to get you lightly hold on my lady check check my one two three gets out of van sometimes what does um just my my human being you know start being like an idiot that's silly and that makes me after this whoa be careful with that for three weeks tony has avoided taking any of the legal highs that gets smuggled onto the wards ready to go yeah  his team has allowed him two hours out in the local community let's do this you got everything i need yeah but he won't be going on his own escorted leave is the first test of a patient's ability to cope with the outside world it's something tony has struggled with since being diagnosed with schizophrenia 18 years ago and you're feeling cold no it's all right it's quite warming isn't it you should see so if you say so he has a long history of absconding from hospitals often making his way back to  his mother's house now you know what i need one-to-one supervision you know what i mean yeah why because i wander off i'll go on my own missions you know someone's got to stay with me you know i don't mind it though because it helps me out you know yeah it's true it makes me feel 10 times better about yourself you know when you've feel like and that yeah in the past there have been physical attacks against his parents tony's turned up at three four five o'clock in the morning started throwing things at the windows  trying to gain entry into the house there's been a lot of fear a lot of anxiety and i think at the moment it's the first time that his family have felt safe knowing that he's in a secure hospital and that he he can't cause them any more distress i would have made it one once once upon a time but but i felt unwell you know yeah you're getting better now getting better yeah it'd be any time two in the morning ten o'clock at night um early hour was tony would be walking up and down the street calling calling me and i used to  to block it out try and block it out used to go into the kitchen and stand out in the kitchen so he couldn't have no contact of seeing me what would he show it mum help me help me help me heartbreaking heartbreaking knowing that you've done it you've tried in the power to do what you can let's just start breaking doing this you're just going to be able to tell that i'm doing all right you know yeah you are you're doing well in that schizophrenia is a chronic condition there are all sorts of psychological  treatments that we can employ to try and help them live with those symptoms and cope with them as best they can but we do have to be always aware that we have our limits to um and that's that's very difficult to come to terms with but maybe we've achieved the best we can but somebody is still unwell is he all right run off oh no i don't eat bacon we have to continue to try but i think it's a case of balancing always the risk to the public and it may be that some people can never leave hospital this is what i have to cope with  it's a drama why's that drama oh look at these boots you know what i mean that would just that's just they've got mud all over them mate from yesterday you can't wear those john's been living under lock and key for 22 years i can't wear those mate you know now he's been judged safe enough to take daily trips into the local community without an escort i mean we all struggle in this i struggle i have uh you know everyone has difficulties done we've all got difficulties [Music] because i do have like this image thing  difficulty with myself and um is it problematic it has been you know self-esteem confidence you know where i perceived myself you know like in the 90s with a guy with a camera filming me in my face all our image and this was on my birthday and you know and i and i reacted quite aggressively to that i threatened him with a knife and went to the kitchen just because he was filming here not because he was filming me it was the reaction that the other people had as if like oh look at you you definitely got a  funny face looking at your head's like you know the men identifying faults that's what i felt i felt like you were identifying faults you were looking at you know i had problems because i've got no knuckles do you know what i mean so i can't bend them so if i've punched somebody i you know that that thing has been broken so i've used a weapon as an extension of this or um as an extension of my my rage so i might have seen a knife as like an injecting injecting all my fear into somebody else you know  a few days after threatening the man with the camera john committed the stabbing that gave him a life sentence five years before that he used a knife on his girlfriend in a violent unprovoked attack it was a similar pattern i feel trapped and i feel i do feel a need to kind of try and protect myself because i strongly perceive a dangerous threat i attacked her and i had stabbed her and i phoned the police and the ambulance and i was arrested and i spent was sentenced to prison for six years what did you feel  about what had happened i felt appalled i felt appalled and disgusted in myself the crimes our patients are involved with are very serious they're they're very tragic they're often extreme 22-22 because of the graveness of their crimes they won't achieve this thing called atonement which is almost a sense of self-forgiveness [Music] our job as a team is to somehow help them bear the enormity of what they've done and that's a really compelling but also very complicated piece of work i think it's about this process you know  it's something meaningful and real has to happen you know there has to be like a genuine change there has to be some understanding about you know these these events however difficult they are and painful they are is to understand these why these things happen this is why i'm in a hospital and this is why i'm trying to you know make amends in some way the decision about whether james can start to make short trips outside the hospital has been delayed frustrated he's struggling to contain the anger that has been key to his  reoffending liberty proper liberty bruh you've been in more huge shakespeare you've tried changing rules and all that you know what i mean it's diabolical it's about coming in alignment with what other recently for the last four years very fine with that interference yeah now let me let me finish before we jump on because i'm left on the wayside time and time again do you know how this reflects one of the difficult things with james is the way that he was treated in his early life i mean a really terrible  history of neglect and abuse one of the worst that i've seen my personality disorders yeah i'm not liked i'm not black you know and this all feeds back into like why didn't i fit in one i've been chose part of this team he's not had the opportunities in his early life to develop an idea of how to relate to people and what relationships are for and i think those difficulties have really been closely related to his offending behavior i'm surfing the urge because like internally i want to scream and shout that's like  part borderline you know it's like i'm just it's like but i'll just have to just ride ride with it you know what i mean yeah you're like a pressure cooker and this could be the slightest little thing that sets you off and and and you're sort of really um rash you know it's like taking a dummy off a baby you know what i mean yeah i could uh just throw a wobbler well i don't want that setback you know what i mean yeah so i just got to refrain myself and just stay calm and just think whatever comes whatever comes comes and it i'll  deal with it you know life's passing me by my you know i mean yeah you know i'm anxious to sort of just get some formal normality normal life i'm like a dog at the lead at the moment trying to you know gnaw it off mate i want to get out there and sort myself out even though i've got a lot of anxiety problems but i just want to get out there and get my life back on track mate you know what's up tony uh um i'm miserable i've got the amp i'm pissed off and my hormones are playing up um it's against my religion  which i don't have a religion but i'm church of england i was bored want to get a move on you know make a start of things common misunderstanding is that it's an easier option being forensic psychiatric care compared to them being in prison i would argue that in fact this is the tougher option when you go to prison you have an end to the sentence the sections that the majority are on here are indefinite they will go on as long as necessary some have been in the secure psychiatric care for decades  and there is no end point oh oh come out of here mate as far as i'm concerned that i don't even know what i'm doing here mate ain't done me no favors mate and that's why i'm losing my temper i want to get out of here mate i've got a life to live i've got a daughter to look after this is like being in the in the cemetery this is like being in a funeral parlor sitting here laying and they're all looking at you i'm thinking you know what's wrong with this div they want me sent back to prison they don't want to see me go out there  because they know what i'm like outside i'm laying on this bed i'm laying on this bed holding my head together holding all my body together now i mean i'm suffocating i'm suffocating in the building how much more they want from me man i can't do no i can't do nothing more can i but i'm all right i'll get for it i've got me i've got my daughter there so i'll just look at the photo every day and just think to myself babes i'll be out one day i'll be out not to worry i'll get out of this i just want to get my life together mate  i wish i could walk right now you know i wish i could walk [Music] [Music] he was 18 years old and it was coming up to christmas and tony had gone to was going to a party he went to the party and then it was about two three days after he'd been to the party he was acting very strange um he kept saying or weird or weird things that was happening i thought this ain't right this ain't right he's it's something he's took something he has definitely took something and he said all he could it was help me mum  help me and he just went down on the floor help me mum help me mum sorry i said that we need to come to the hospital the hospital and so i took him up to the hospital and they sectioned him there and then for six weeks and i lost him i'd lost him tony can be very scary he is voices yeah the voices tell him what to do and he says he has to do it he said i don't want to hurt no one but they they tell me what i've got to do i had to cut tony off for his own for his own good for his own benefit and that it's very  hard as a mum when you've got a shutter door on your son that is old no there's nothing you can do you've tried and you tried and you tried and you can't and you can't do no more he's took the fight from me the fight has gone from me do you expect children or your kids or whatever to do well but never happened in his case did it should we make a cup of tea keep it up here get the pill get some piece of pill wake me up [Music] james has finally got a decision [Music] his escorted leave to the local town has  been approved [Music] he hasn't been allowed outside an institution in this way since he was arrested for robbery 17 years ago yes hey finland that's all right no problem no stress eight weeks of non-smoking you know what i mean yeah he's about to just go down the pan oh gosh generally with leaves the concerns that you've got to take into account are the likelihood of the patient disappearing absconding with him in particular that's less of a concern the greater concern is just not really coping when he's out wanting to  return very quickly panicking and becoming very emotionally aroused and just losing his confidence [Music] it's nice to be able to normality in that guy yeah just seeing the world go by you're not mean yeah away from the ward you're not mean yeah i love it coming up here mate bundles yeah it's just different pace of life out here you know at first when i come out was quite bricking it you know felt really unusual i'm on leave i'm on tag all the different aspects to it do you know what i mean yeah it's like  but you just ignore it at the end of the day nobody don't know who i am what i'm doing you know i'm just mingling in like normal people do i am normal you know what i mean yeah i've got personality disorders it doesn't mean i'm a raven lunatic do you know what i mean it's all good mate [Music] hello mate did you do any uh pork belly strips you can have a couple of them please yeah do you know what i'm asking what yeah yeah hang on a second mate yo guess that bag can we check that bag a sec oh that's it  what all freshly done and i thought i'd lost a lot and now i found it you know what i mean now what a relief mate i feel like i'm gonna pass out man i felt really stressed to know that i really did let me just get some bit of air mate because i i feel really uh stressed mate james left his wallet in the record shop he visited earlier in the day stress ed so i said oh gosh did you know what it was a testable test because internally i was screaming inside i was ah cheers thanks so much mike appreciate  you matey thank you yeah cheers lifesaver he's got a long way to go before i think he's ready for more extensive community leave and even beginning to think about unescorted leave i think that's a way off he could be moving on the next year to 18 months but i think that would be best case scenario and i think he sometimes underestimates how difficult it's going to be yeah he's he's uh not high and dry yeah i'm going back to the ward now i'm depressed i want to get back out here my real world get on with my life my  and yeah cheers for today mate and thanks for your company cheers mate as the prospect of being discharged from the bethlehem royal becomes real john has started to look for voluntary work subject [Music] volunteering dsm madame are currently an inpatient with the bathroom royal hospital i'm current i currently have extensive community leave and i'm currently looking i currently currently i'd be grateful if you could let me know of any positions you have a terrible photograph you're sincerely send  beautiful this me as a kid i reckon i'm 13. and with my bowl cut but just i think it's uh i think it's sad because of like uh you know this kid he's not he's not smoking he's not drinking oh good to see you around how are you doing and where has life taken you see how do you answer that where do you even begin with that where do you even start hi mate i don't even know where to start i've been in the hospital recently mate i had a few psych problems that's for the last 35 years an email letter or two  [Music] how do you explain 35 years [Music] [Music] [Music] doctors are about caring and i take pride in the fact that i'm working with a group of patients who are probably the most dispossessed sideline rejected in society shame and isolation for patient increases their risk if we tackle that effectively compassionately we reduce the risk significantly we've got two options as a society we either lock up offenders with personality disorder and they're just removed from society altogether or my position  which is to try and get something positive out of these horrendous incidents these individuals didn't emerge from a vacuum they came from families who lived in streets and had neighbours and they very much are a product of society too and i do think we have a responsibility to think about how we support manage understand them to me the options of doing nothing just doesn't make any sense you just got rolled in there time i know i know all right yeah just stalled don't in there yeah but you're all right yeah  tony you you know the rules it's once a month yeah okay all right then and i'll speak to you soon all right all right love y'all [Music] you 	Center			Liberal	62
G70	https://youtu.be/5cgjwivoerg?si=ltZlEulrIMGMtoTy	Brian cober's trial erupts in anger in the courtroom are local and potential jars being poisoned I'm Nancy Grace this is crime stories good evening and thank you for joining [Music] us the judge erupts in anger in the courtroom as we learn the defense team for Brian coburger has been reaching out by phone to potential jurar basically tainting the jury pool but now we realize giving away their defense strategy you know it's been so long now since the quadruple sleigh in Idaho me people are getting fuzzy on the  facts and that's exactly what the defense wants delay delay delay is the defense attorney's best friend but here's a harsh reminder on the evening of November 12th and into the early morning hours of November 13th Kaylee and Madison arrived home at approximately 1:45 a.m. after visiting a local bar and a street food vendor Ethan and Zanna were also out in the community at Sigma Chai and they arrived home at approximately 1:45 a.m. two surviving roommates who were also out in the community arrived home at  approximately 1:00 a.m. later on the morning of November 13th at 11:58 a.m. a 911 call was placed the call reported an unconscious person the call originated from inside the residence and a surviving roommate cell phone was used but it was not an unconscious person listen morto Police Captain Roger lenir during that call the dispatcher spoke to multiple people who were on scene Moscow police officers responded and found two victims two on the second floor and two on the third floor of 1122 King  Road the results of autopsies indicated that the four were stabbed multiple times and were likely asleep during the attack some had defensive wounds and there was no sign of sexual assault joining me in Allstar panel to make sense of what we know right now but there is a major major Kur fuffle in the courtroom igniting Anger from the judge is it true that cober's defense team has actually been communicating with potential jurs long before a jury is even struck and is this an Insidious way of tainting the jury pool and getting  the change of venue they so desperately want take a listen to Dave Matt crime online as the cobber defense team moves ahead with their preparation to get the trial moved out of lto County they put together a research project and hired a polling company to conduct a survey of area residents and ask them questions about how much they may know about the murders the company had reached around 400 residents before a concered citizen recorded one of the survey phone calls and contacted the District Attorney's  office to complain about the call prosecutors now say the polling company was asking questions to plant negative opinions of coburger in potential jurors Minds in the hopes the calls would serve to prove that local people were prejudiced against coburger and the trial should be moved to another County first to highly respected journalist is the crime in courts correspondent at Newsweek Sean O'Driscoll Sean thank you for being with us what the hay is happening yeah it's a very serious development Nancy we have a situation  where 400 jurors in a small County have now been contacted and told they've been given nine questions about how they feel about Brian koberger and those those are questions that if they were ignoring this case they now know an awful lot about it very incriminating information about Brian cerer that is now as as a prosecutor said is now saturated with the jur with potential jurors in the case you know what's interesting guys with me sha Driscoll crime in courts correspondent Newsweek to Tara Malik  joining us high-profile lawyer out of this jurisdiction uh there in Idaho it's Smith mik.com Tara if the state the prosecution had done this you know what would happen very possibly a Miss trial before the trial even starts with prejudice in other words the state may not be allowed to retry the case and this is a big deal Torah it's a very big deal I mean just to remind everyone there's been a gag order issued by the judge and so the parties are not supposed to be speaking publicly or disseminating publicly  anything about the case and so the judge um certainly made it clear that he was displeased with the process that the defense had undertaken to go about this polling and you're talking about a small you know a small County uh 400 people being contacted is a really big deal and some of those questions were certainly uh seemed to be planting information or suggesting information that I think the prosecutor even remarked were not factually accurate and wouldn't be introduced at the trial itself okay I am she sounded like um a criminal  procedure Professor speaking to Three L's not one L's but Three L's because they know a good bit of procedural language Tara let me break it down these questions that were asked our potential jurar on the phone and the judge got a hold of an audio tape somebody taped one of these calls from the defense and the it brings up issues that may not even be allowed at trial hey let let's see the tears of what exactly was asked of these potential jurar nine questions that we know of the judge whose last name is  judge judge judge let me just say royally poed technical legal term okay here we go have you read seen or heard if Brian coburger was arrested at his parents home in Pennsylvania well whoa wait a minute what if the circumstances of that arrest had been thrown out what if the jury wasn't allowed to hear that he was apprehended standing in his kitchen his parents Kitchen in his in some shorts I think possibly his underwear wearing rubber gloves separating trash okay right there strike one what normal guy is wearing rubber gloves in  his parents Kitchen in his underwear separating the trash okay number two have you read seen or heard if police found a knife sheath on the bed next to one of the victims okay that goes straight to finding DNA let's see the next set of questions nine questions in all very quickly if I could see three and four have you read seen or heard that DNA found on the knife sheath was later matched to Brian cobber okay wait a minute wait a minute what if by some impossible feat the defense managed to get that DNA thrown out well now  they've just tainted the jury pool by telling them there was DNA on the knife sheath that matched to Brian coburger four have you read seen or heard if cerg owned the same type of car reported seen driving in the neighborhood where the killings occurred right there we see where the defense is going we all know his vehicle was spotted in the area hold on Liz cart before the horse but now we see they're headed towards saying that just looked like his car not his car five have you read seen or heard if the cell phone tower data  showed coburger made several trips near the victim's home in the month before the killing that tells me they're going to attack the cell phone tower information have you read seen or heard if University students in Moscow and their parents live Liv in fear until coburger was arrested for the murders what does that tell me they're going to tell the jury that cob Berger's arrest was premature and police were pressured because everyone was living in fear let's see the rest let's see number seven have you read seen or heard if  coburger said he was out driving alone the night of the murders man I'd come up with a different Alibi if I could uh but sadly for them they've already committed to this they can't change it now eight have you read seen or heard coburger stalked one of the victims and nine have you read seen or heard if cob Berger had followed one of the victims on social media and you know what's interesting that may not even come into evidence allegations that coburger had been stalking we think it was kayy Gonzalez  not sure yet one of the victims on social that may never come into evidence okay back to our Allstar panel to Shan O Driscoll crime and courts correspondent for Newsweek hey Sean I want you to take a listen to the prosecutor angry this is him angry in court listen your honor there is absolutely no question but that those questions are disseminating by means of communication evidence expected to be presented evidence that could be or with the inadmissible at trial and I will say there are a number of these  representations placed in the form of a question but representations of fact that are not true or that would not be offered to try sha o Driscoll uh joining us from Newsweek they're basically leading questions which is what the prosecutor or the defense would do if they had a witness from the other side on cross-examination you basically give your theory of the case one sentence at a time and at the end you say isn't that true that's basically what these questions are now tell me the whole thing how did this go down  Sean well they hired up a polling company for the defense to try and show that there was too much um bias against Brian ker koberger and the local County um so then they called somebody that person got a bit suspicious of they called recorded a call and then went to the DA's office to make a complaint about it and that's when they learned about all of these questions and as you say they are leading questions I mean the very definition of a lead leading question is whether you can answer it with a yes or no question all of which  in this case you can I mean it's it's you know it's like are you aware that Nancy Grace is accused of stealing a handbag and that we all now live in fear of her I mean it's it's so tainting the jury pool as the prosecutor says that um it's it's difficult to see how they can how they can continue on with this because 400 people are now aware of all of these questions and as Tara Malik pointed out a high-profile lawyer there in Idaho it's a very small jurisdiction hey there's nothing wrong with being a small  jurisdiction I grew up in rural bib County we were not even in a city uh a very idelic childhood so this city people keep saying oh it's small like there's something wrong with it but what that means for us is that this has a more profound effect on a smaller jury pool because 400 people out of a jury pool of 3,000 is a lot that's a hypothetical let me bring in our other guests I want to go first to Chris mcdna he is the director of The Cold Case Foundation former homicide detective with hundreds  and hundreds of homicide investigations under his belt I found him on the interview room and what fascinated me with what he did along with his wife they were driving at about 2 miles an hour this is before I went to Moscow and showing me everything I needed to know about the layout of where the murder scene was the roads that led to it they're very narrow there were so many evidentiary details in that drive along I had to meet this guy and everything I learning that video turned out to be true Chris McDonna and Joe Scott Morgan  I want to talk to the two of you um Joe Scott of course is Professor forensics Jacksonville State University author of blood beneath my feet on Amazon he is a death investigator and he is the host of body bags with Joe Scott Morgan podcast now to Chris and Joe Scott first to you Chris we're talking about courtroom antics can we talk about what this case is about because as Liz and Jackie were showing me photos and sound we're kind of forgetting about the four victims look at them look at them this is them in life  Joe Scott's going to tell you about how they were found in death but isn't it true Chris McDon that so often the victims get lost in the sauce of all the courtroom Antics I mean I could just snap the head off this defense attorney Ann Taylor if I could get close enough to her Chris bring it all home what about these victims losing their lives yeah let's never forget that right Nancy I mean here you have four innocent um college students with their whole lives ahead of them I mean and then they're slaughtered in their bed we  sleeping and there that means Generations now have stopped uh instantly no more you know grandbabies etc for the for the surviving family members as well so this is a huge huge situation where the victims do get lost sometimes through the courtroom and I think it's imperative that um not only the community around there but you know to your point the world remember they have have to remember that the victims here need Justice and that Justice needs to come swiftly sometimes and these Court Romantics like this sometimes you  know clog that [Music] wheel this is this is a very um not a usual case number one and you know that we've been working very very hard to keep the sort of noise out the case and now it's been injected at least to these four 400 people without a permission of the Court without disc discussion with with the state I mean that's Troublesome and then and then when I'm being accused directly accused okay by you in your grief that I violated his due process rights now that's not what the law says and that's not what the facts  are violating C- brers D process rights no way this guy is reportedly getting vegan meals his own TV control of the remote visits you name it I guarantee you he's getting love letters think about that for a moment what is the judge talking about that he the judge who is Judge judge judges his last name that he is somehow violating the rights of coburger I'll tell you in a nutshell first of all the coburger judge slamming the defense for quizzing local potential jurar basically causing an error in the trial yet to be and  guaranteeing a change of venue which is what they want but also a very Insidious um sneaky thing they did was that when the judge wanted to stop the polling they are now claiming that is violating coburger right to Due Process what is due process it means that basically you're getting treated fairly under the system that we have established in the US you get a right to a jury you get a right to a fair jury you get a right to a trial you get a right to a lawyer even if you cannot afford one there's a whole  host of Rights and Privileges and everyone is to be afforded due process a fair trial they're now claiming the judge has taken that away from Brian cober he's kicked back having his vegan meal right now laughing his rear end off okay I want to talk one more moment before we go back into what's happening right now the anger that has been ignited in this courtroom room and I want to go to Joe scottt Morgan uh Professor forensics Jacksonville State University Joe Scott a lot is being made of trial  Maneuvers I want to talk about how these four beautiful young Idaho students were found see we're seeing them in life that's not how they were found that is not how according to the state coburger left them explain Chris mentioned the term a little while ago uh of Slaughter and I I'd say that that kind of sums it up uh what we're talking about here because we're talking about multiple stab wounds and not just stab wounds if we are to believe what has been released relative to these defensive injuries and also one  injury in particular uh defensively where it sounds as though perhaps the knife was actually drugg across the palm of one of the victim's hands cutting all the way down to the tendons these were were viable young lovely students children somebody's children certainly that loved them very much and now they're absolutely gone and Nancy one other thing here that we really have to Plum the depth of here aside from you know all of these wranglings that they're talking about this is okay if I were to rate this case one to 10 10  being the most complex relative to the forensics that are involved this is going to be right at about a 10 because you're dealing with all of these various facets that we're going to have to examine and be examined in court we just talked about them outside the the context of the courtroom when you get into this when you really begin to dig in there's going to be a tremendous amount of blood evidence not to mention this DNA evidence that has been at the the point of the spear with all of this and the electronic evidence then  something that has raised its head along the way is this forensic genealogy that's also come into play and so the case is complex enough and you're going to throw this into this mix and you really really if you think the the jury pool is Tainted at this point my concern is that the continuity of the evidence is going to be despoiled in this as well because this narrative is going to be highly complex to be able to lay out to a jury so that they understand it I have uh the experience that jurar understand really well exactly  even complex scientific evidence that they've been given Joe Scott you've been to many many crime scenes as have I um I remember my first mass killing there were three dead bodies blood was literally running down a gutter because one of the young boys that had been shot down on on a playground around 11:00 p.m. on a Sunday night had made a run for it and he got as far as a chainlink fence he was jumping the fence when he too was shot dead and he hung on the fence for an extended period of time bleeding out into the gutter below the  fence by the time I saw it blood was literally running down the gutter Liz if I could please see these victims in life because that crime scene Joe Scott was horrific that's kind of crime scene that makes rookies go out and throw out throw up outside four incredible beautiful vivacious look at them students their bodies by that time cold ripped open going into rigor the smell of deom had probably already started the sticky blood was coagulating on sheets on the floor throughout the home and that feeling that heavy feeling  in the air where a dead body is a murdered body is what greeted police that Jo Scott Morgan is what we're talking about as the defense does one cartwheel after the next to get the client off you're absolutely right Nancy and you know there's there's this idea that the blood will tell and the and what I meant by that was that the deposition or the depositing of the blood within within the bedrooms and not to mention anywhere else that we might not have an awareness of at this point point in time  that's going to be a complex story to tell and remember we're already missing the house it's gone okay at this point so we're relying upon how the scene was documented I'm sure that they'll do a fantastic job presenting it but we're absent that already so their blood those images that we have are going to be very important to tell the [Music] tale we have heard mention that Kaylee stated she may have had a stalker detectives have been looking into that and to this point have been unable to corroborate the statement although we  continue to seek information and tips regarding that report no suspects have been named or arrested and we continue looking for what we believe to be a fixed blade knife used in the murders you are hearing Police Captain Roger laner in Moscow Idaho talking about the possibility that one of the Idaho victims most likely to be KY Gonzalez was stalked on social media what does that have to do with the coburger case why is he talking about that obviously because it's connected now when we look at these  questions the defense has posed on phone calls to 400 of the jury pool number nine says have you read seen or heard Brian H Berger had followed followed one of the victims on social media well that tells me right there uh Tara Malik joining me high-profile lawyer at Smith and Malik in Idaho that tells me that if that evidence does come in that cob Berger had been trying to hook up with one of the victims or follow them or stalk them as it has been stated they're going to try to argue he just followed one of them innocently so  that tells me where they're going with that yeah potentially I mean I think that they're trying to or they may try and explain way if there is some evidence that coburger either came in contact or was familiar with these folks and and put it as you mentioned in an innocent spin on it um now there certainly seems to be from what we know right now a lot of evidence to suggest that that um he's he this was a very calculated uh crime and that he may have done some research ahead of time before it was actually committed um familiarity  with the location with perhaps at least one of the individuals so uh certainly gives us some hints as to what the defense may be trying to do or set up for although you know an Taylor did say in court that she did not draft the particular questions she did approve the topics uh that were um used by the pollster in formulating the questions themselves Tara did you just say that the defense lawyer an Taylor she didn't write the questions she just approved them did I hear that that's correct from what her statements were or her  arguments were in court to judge judge she indicated that she had not actually written the questions that were used in the poll but that she had had approved the topics she also indicated that um the poll stir was not given any facts from her team or any evidence from her team prior to putting those questions together got it I got it I got it Tara yes I hear your defense of Ann Taylor and I'm sure she appreciates it I think that's a line of BS I really do to Dr lesie Dobson joining us forensic psychologist at Dr lesle dobson.com  you say potato I say potato so you can't have it both ways although Tara Malik that's why she went so many cases is giving it a valiant try to defend the defense attorney here you can't say the pollsters who who actually made these phone calls at the behest of the defense they knew nothing about the case you can't say that and the defense lawyer didn't make up these questions okay somebody directed these question questions and if the pollster knew nothing about the case then how did they come up with the questions bottom line  the defense approved these questions it would be a cold dat in houl that they use money for a pollster and they don't approve of the questions that would be like me sending you Dr lesle for a polygraph and I don't come up with or help create the questions for the poly that's not happen happening the polygrapher doesn't know what to ask I have to tell him or her what to ask and then they put it in the right format so you can't have it both ways Polster had no idea about the case and we didn't write those questions BS how could she  even say that in front of the judge does she think he's an idiot because he's not yes I read that a social psychologist was hired to put the questions together so the information was gained through what he claimed was in the media and readily able okay question to you Dr lesie Dobson so the defense hires upholster to call the locals and ask them questions about the facts of the case prior to jury selection as you have heard the questions today they touch on very significant parts of the case critical  parts of the case so do you really believe the defense know what the questions were going to be after they paid for a pollster I don't believe it no having worked with many many attorneys in criminal and civil law I I think the game is on Full display right now following up with Chris McDon who has been to the crime scene has analyzed the crime scene and has handled well over 300 homicide investigations jumping Chris you know Nancy I think one of the things that you've pointed out here is you know there are 400 uh potential  Witnesses remember she the defense put that in one of their motions well how would they know there are 400 potential Witnesses when of course you've got now 400 people that have been pulled in the community uh I think that's an interesting correlation that would need some clarity uh and I'm concerned that the prosecution kind of fell for it by actually reading those questions in open court and why the judge didn't pull them into V you know into in Cameron hearing to where the public now everybody knows  about these nine questions around the world are you seriously trying to say with a straight face Chris MCD that anybody watching this coverage hasn't already heard about the cobber case no not at all in fact what I'm saying is these nine questions which are being AR argued you know by both the prosecution and the defense are now known to everybody uh that's what I'm saying and and that in of itself you kind of goes against the the the purpose of uh the [Music] hearing Judge John judge set an April  17th deadline for goldberger's legal team to provide documents related to an alibi last year at least two possible aliis were set out by cob Berger's attorney the first saying it was C Berger's Habit to go for long drives alone late at night defense attorney an Taylor later gave the court brief information saying quote evidence cooperating Mr Colberg being at a location other than the King Road address will be disclosed pursuant to Discovery and evidentiary rules as well as statutory requirements unquote the  location has not been revealed so the defense is sticky to the rigorous guidelines of the law and deadlines and limitations when it suits them but now are caught red-handed poisoning the jury pool and a small jurisdiction you bring in 400 people and they've all been quizzed already about the case by the defense pollster guarantee you that is going to be caused for a change of venue why why is that significant Tara Malik uh it's significant because when you change a venue it's much harder on the  state it is I mean we're talking about U moving witnesses to maybe local to that Community to a different location to testify uh maybe even for multiple days so it does put the burden on the state puts on the burden on the defense as well but we don't they don't have to put on a defense they don't have if they don't want to and they certainly don't have to put on on Witnesses if they don't want to uh the burden is entirely on the state now this defense has taken the step of saying that we do have an  alibi which puts the burden on them to um come up with that alibi but uh yeah it it is going to add some complications here that that didn't already exist and and I would note too you know that for the change of venue it's just pre-trial publicity alone is not enough to change venue in a particular case like that's certainly not enough to Shan oiso joining us from Newsweek Sean talking about an alibi and the defense of course has not handed Over The Alibi yet they've got to hand over an alibi because the state has a  right to question Witnesses or evidence that support that alibi be it surveillance video be it the nav system in cobber Elantra the state has a right to question that Alibi did you hear what was said that they may bring on corroboration for The Alibi that he is driving around at 3:00 4 o'clock 5 o'l in the morning and hey Sean while I've got you this is a real clue as to where they're headed with these nine questions they sent to all the jur to potential jurar uh about the car they asked specifically uh whether the potential  jurar has found out or heard about the type same type of car seen in the neighborhood where the murders occurred so they're basically tipping us off that the defense is going to be yeah there was a white Elantra but it wasn't him right in fact part of the prosecution case in their own documents that they filed in court is that they have an FBI expert who's not only an expert on models of cars but even Regional variations within those models of cars who then link this type of car somewhere between 2011 2014 then  expanded that range slightly by looking at the CCTV of slightly slight parts of the car so I think what the defense are really trying to say is yeah okay you've got us his car was around you have it on CCTV the type of model of car but his his hobby is to drive around in the middle of the night in this particular car which is actually common common purpose between defense and prosecution in this case that that okay hold on Shauna Driscoll a crime in courts correspondent at Newsweek let me ask you  a quick question regarding that can you have it both ways can you claim as they apparently are going to do as evidenced by this question have you heard the same type of car with was spotted in the area clearly tipping me off that they're going to argue yeah there was a white El Elantra but it wasn't his do you have the license plate No in fact it could be an entirely different year make or model okay they're going to argue it wasn't his car but is that consistent with The Alibi yeah he was out driving around at  three or four o'clock that night in the morning so is it him driving by there by the murder scene or is it not his car to me that's inconsistent but I see them bit by bit Sean trying to dismantle the state's case that's what this is to them they're taking each piece of strong evidence and trying to dismantle it piece of evidence his car was spotted at the scene hello at 3:00 in the morning and then he went back by later that day they're going to claim that looked like his car but it wasn't his car and by the  way he often drives around late at night all alone which screams to me freaky dude right I mean you have to really wonder you have to take juror as as normal people like all of us who are wondering okay where was he well he was driving around in in the same type of model of card at night um and also how does this then play into jury selection if the jury if the jurors are now 400 of them are have been told all of this what does what does the defense now know about those 400 people that hasn't been  disclosed yet you know what have they written down their names did they know their addresses when they're when it comes to jury selection do they now know what all of those juror potential jurors now know about this model of car about what they know about DNA evidence and all sorts of [Music] information the families of kayy gonz and zaner kodal issued a public statement sharing their frustration and not having a trial start date yet L talk prosecutor Bill Thompson says he could be ready to present his case in March of  2025 while cober's lead attorney Anne Taylor says she will not be ready until June 2025 Taylor also says she plans to call 400 Witnesses in a trial expected to last 6 weeks in their open letter the Gonzalez and Koto family statement begins with why are victims families so misunderstood the letter concludes with we want to start healing we do we want to find Justice and try to move on from this horrible tragedy so please please start making some decisions can you believe by the time this goes to trial around three years  will have passed since the murders to you J Scott Morgan death investigator you have been on so many thousands of homicide and uh Death Scenes the longer you wait to go to trial and I've been there one of the first cases I had to try not the first but one of the first was to retry a case that had been tried when I was back in law school and I've told you this Joe Scott when I went into the evidence room to get the evidence there was one x-ray I didn't even know what it was or who it went to what it had to do with the case and a  baseball cap that said kiss my bass that was all the evidence we could find from the first trial I'm ser ious and I had to Cobble together a case as time goes on memories dim you lose evidence Witnesses actually die they had died in those 14 years before I had to retry that case so that's the problem with the delay but what about what it does to the victim's families every day no justice it grinds on and on and on and I still have a vivid memory of hearing this we had gotten back from church and  that particular day and when this case dropped and now even even to this point as much as I've covered this case with you Nancy some of the details are beginning to fade for me how much more so because I I you know we do this regularly uh but you know all of the principles and here's here's one other interesting little aside here uh this is a university environment Nancy and we all know what happens at University Environ in University uh environments people move on with their lives and what I mean by that is you have kids that may  have been Witnesses at that particular time their life has gone on as a matter of fact many of them may have graduated they're going to have to be coming back to this environment the the landscape has changed we no longer have a home to recall uh what happened that particular night so everything is going to rest uh upon what is contained within that evidence room that you peripherally mentioned just a second ago and you know that I can tell you who hasn't forgotten the people that walked into that  structure and they saw that bloodbath and they saw what had happened and it's just as real to them right now as it was that day we wait as Justice unfolds and now we stop to remember American hero Sergeant Mark McIntyre just 55 McIntyre shot and killed in the line of duty Griffin Georgia a proud vet of the US Army dedicated member of the community leaving behind daughter Kimber son Parker fiance Karen and her sons American hero Sergeant Mark McIntyre thank you to our guests but especially to you for being with us  tonight and every night Nancy Grace signing off I'll see you tomorrow night 6 and 9 o' sharp Eastern and until then good night friend [Music] hello I am officer Lingus stops being audio and video recorded think I know I think you know why I stopped you you ran the red light what actually happened was I was stuck in the middle of the intersection yeah so I I was behind you the whole time yeah yeah so technically you're not supposed to enter the intersection at all for that reason because if the light turns red then  you're stuck in the intersection then you run the red light so that's reason I stopped you do you have your license on you so can you would you explain that to me a little bit further so in Pennsylvania when you're stuck like in their intersection you have to make the left so what would what would the appropriate thing for me to have done just just you're not supposed to block an intersection like that in Washington so just by you blocking the intersection that's technically a ticketable violation guys thank you for watching  crime online with Nancy Grace here on YouTube to get the very latest subscribe to Crime online here

G84	https://youtu.be/68dWPDnONGE?si=G4A2EFLtj3b3Sh4Z	welcome back to another crypto Gorilla video today is part two for airdrops you can Farm to hopefully receive gen wealth for absolutely free small caveat some of them are not going to be free they're going to have parts that will cost a little bit of money but for the most part it is a majority of free airdrop farming of course it does cost you time and effort so not free in that sense but it's not going to cost you money now as usual nothing in this video is financial advice I can't guarantee the size or  value of any of these airdrops so keep that in mind before investing your time into them but if you appreciate these videos would you kindly hit that subscribe button and while you're down there smash the like button as it really helps my channel reach a wider audience so first on our list we have exter by exterio now if you don't know exterio they are a game Studio working on a ton of games they also have a Launchpad where they work with other games and they have helped launch a ton of successful mints like aof verse Persona  play Ember as well as their own mints like Overworld age of dyo if we check their site they have a huge list of games many of which have upcoming mints so definitely don't sleep on the exterior platform you want to browse these games and look which ones have upcoming mints but they're also going to have their own token which is going to power their entire exterio ecosystem it's even going to be used in some of these games either as a primary token or a secondary token so this is definitely a token you want to get your hands- on  especially if you can do it for free now they just launched their farming campaign there are going to be multiple ways to do this one of the ways is through their games the first game is their own AI game called paleo which we do have on screen here if you look at the top you can see they have four different chapters and we are currently in chapter 1 so you are very early and this is essentially a tamagachi Style game where you have to take care of your pet or companion whatever you want to call it and interact with it so you are  going to be prompted to generate a pet unfortunately this is one of the ones that you are going to have to pay a little bit of money for they are going to prompt you to have BNB on their exterio chain so I did it you have to bridge in and then there are transactions that you have to do it's very cheap right it's like 10 cents to do a transaction not even but if you're doing this daily it does add up over time so just keep that in mind so here I already did it uh unfortunately this is the second time I film through this part  because I did film the first one with without a microphone so I wanted to save all these interactions for you guys but basically like you just get an apple and then you click on the Apple it gives them the Apple you get some points up here after that you can interact with your pet and it's going to evolve based on how you speak to it and what you're teaching it so here it asked me a question about love I had to generate you could use chat GPD if you want I had to come up with my own answer to explain  what love is and then it replies to you it gives it a score so I got 96 on my reply and from from there you can mint an nft again minting the nft is going to cost you a little bit of money she just knocked over my budget penguin moving on this is the free section right a lot of social quests where you like follow them on Twitter engage with posts and stuff like that and they also have a section at the bottom where you can vote however the main ones that I'm going to be doing is the ones that's going to cost money  obviously I'll do all the social stuff but I'm going to be doing this text prompt stuff uh to make my pet evolve over time you can also buy a boost I did buy it it was something like $5 and then of course you can invite others you would just click the invite section you copy your code and then you send it to whoever you're inviting I wish it would generate a link but anyways this is where you come to paste your code and then you would just hit confirm and I'm going to get a nice little boost for it  now I know this section is about exterio token not paleo so these paleo points are going to be tradable for exterio points which is going to lead to you getting the extra token now this is just one of the ways you can get your hands on it they have multiple games so they will be doing multiple game campaigns the next one is going to be age of Dino which is their mobile game with Dinosaurs in it so how can you not love it I have no idea if there are any transaction fees in that game like there are in paleo but outside of that in an  AMA Jeremy did say that they are going to be kicking off a social farming campaign so similar to portal and a lot of the other ones we've seen for the moment you can do some of these quests on Sesame however I assume they're going to be launching their own platform and and another thing Jeremy has said in the AMA was that you want to participate in as many of these as possible and you won't regret it direct quote so hopefully we get a beautifully sized airdrop for doing all of this farming so if you haven't already signed up for  exteral if you haven't signed up for Paleo links down below if you can use my code it's going to help me out next up we have revolving games with their arcade token now revolving games is the studio behind web 3 games like skyborne their nfts are doing incredibly well the nexian gems this was a free Min currently sitting at like 1.3 e they also did the RG bytes which is the main revolving games nft which are currently at like a 2X of their mint price so a lot of people are very hyped towards this project even in my investment  Syndicate Wizards Capital we brought in the revolving games investment deal and people were very happy that we did that so A lot of people are highly anticipating their upcoming token now if you want to farm it for absolutely free you could head over to their side quest and here it's the typical uh farming that we see on a lot of these platforms you have time based quests so these are going to last up to a week where you interact with posts retweeting commenting on them down here you have the simple like hey follow this page  follow our teammate whatever it is and then at the top of course you have the referrals I'll put my code crypto gorilla YT in the description down below and finally you have the wheel I spun it in my other footage and I got the lowest amount possible I got 50 today hopefully tomorrow in 53 minutes I'll I'll spend it again hopefully I hit 3K but that's the daily reason for you to come back to this platform they will have more interactive quests hopefully in the near future but for the time being this is  what it is look it's simple it's free do it next up we have cookie with their affiliate marketing platform now currently this is really about onboarding K's as if we go to the dashboard here you could see it even says invite K's and get an airdrop kol's means key opinion leader it's just a fancy term for influencer and just for signing up as a k i got 200,000 points because I do have 150k on Twitter and you can see here the minimum amount of points that you need to qualify for the airdrop is 100k now I understand you  might not have 100K but the beauty here is if you on board people who have a big following you're going to get 32% of their points and points from their activ ities and then anybody they invite you are going to get 16% and then any invitees of their invite you are going to get 8% of their points so if you have a good network if you know people or even if you just know people who know people uh you are going to be able to benefit from that just from that multi-level marketing strategy right and I say that in a positive way like we  love our ponzi's in web3 so remember I said I had 200k points for signing up I currently have 500k and that's because I invited I only invited two people I invited safs and Champs they have a good following so I got points for that and then they invited other people so I got points for that so I'm just doing nothing uh collecting points now if you go down here and you click my network I don't know why it doesn't work for me but it seems to work for everybody else here it's going to tell you who in your  network has not joined the platform so it kind of makes your life a lot easier and then this is where you go to get your referral codes Unfortunately they expire and you could only use one per person I understand the strategy on cookie behalf it keeps you coming back to the platform interacting with it you need to come get more codes hopefully with the next Campaign which should be launching in 18 hours so by the time you see this video probably only a few hours their affiliate and Community campaign  hopefully this is where they want to onboard the masses so it's not individual codes hopefully we get like a one use code that anybody can use or not a one use code a individual link that can be used many times but uh for the time being they have great investors so I do think this one is worth grinding you only need to 100K points to qualify for the airdrop so I did it and I'm going to keep inviting people and Shilling my code next we have the Beyond token by Playground now I wasn't sure I was going to include this one just cuz  the platform's been a little bit buggy I do have a call with the team to chat about their campaign however the season 1 which is only a week so don't think like you're a month late uh season 1 is expiring on April 7th so I figured I'd put it in a video as early as possible and then you can go figure it out from there it's super simple right refer others I'll put my code cryptog gorilla in the description down below they do have multipliers I have no idea why I qualify for none of these but the main  way they want you to get points even more than referring others is by Shilling it on social media right Shilling the Beyond ticker and whenever you talk about them or whenever you post about them and you get a view you'll get one point a like is going to get you two points and so on until quote tweets which are the most valuable at 10 points you you also get a 25x multiplier if you interact with their posts I assume they mean these posts here the power posts now just to illustrate what I mean when  I say you get a lot more points in these types of campaigns when you post about them versus when you invite people if we go to overt trip which I spoke about in the last airdrop farming and I go to invites you could see I've invited or you know because of my videos right it really helps me a lot uh 680 or 648 people have used my link 510 of them have actually signed up but if I go to home I only have 4,600 points and then if we go to leaderboard you can see like the top people this guy's pushing close to a  million right and even if we scroll down like a lot of these people have six figure points so I don't know how many people they've invited but I'm assuming they're getting a lot of their points for posting on social media which again if we go back to Beyond you get a lot of points for views versus I'm not exactly sure how many you get for inviting people but they really benefit a lot more when you're Shilling them on social media cuz people are going to sign up anyways versus if you send somebody a  link right so uh if you really are serious about these types of grinds you know it's about posting not so much inviting other people next up we have Saku monsters now I covered this one like I don't know a month or maybe six weeks ago with their free campaign with their mobile app where you literally just log in twice a day when you get a ping tap an egg and you receive points and it does seem like it's going to pay off to those who did that as they have finally started to tweet about their Saku token so hopefully we get a nice  airdrop however the second phase of their campaign is going to be dropping and they are going to be introducing monsters into the mix so I am very excited for Phase 2 I think the monsters look super cool and I love what I'm seeing out of this team they are progressing very quickly uh unfortunately it is still only available on iOS you can download it directly in the app store I'll put a link down below I'll also put my referral code down below if you want to use it and help me get more points however for Phase 2  don't expect this phase to be free uh I don't know the exact details I do have a call Planned with them but yeah don't expect it to just be a free campaign like Phase 1 as there is going to be some interesting mechanics with the monsters next on the list we have anime chain now this one is by isuki look I say by isuki with the little bunny ears because they are partnered with isuki as their first partner as well as arbitrum however if you remember this like their original post were about it was called  weeb Foundation now they have a rebranded to anime coin or anime chain anyways doesn't matter it's partnered with auki so we're going to grind it they do have a website called anime.xyz and once you're here if you click get started it is going to take you to points. anime.xyz so it also seems like they are going to have their own social farming campaign where first you're going to need to follow them on Twitter from there they're going to prompt you to interact with one of their post they're also going to ask you to post an  image uh for now that's all we have however I do imagine this is going to become an entire farming thing cuz literally every single project is doing this and if this is actually an isuki token I do imagine this is going to be a cook I know we just had another anime token that front ran them from capsule house which initially performed really well hopefully you did not buy the top because it is down really bad however if isuki does it the right way which it does seem like they are I do imagine this is going to have a longer lifespan  because isuki is dope people love isuki not that capsule house isn't dope I love the artist behind capsule house but unfortunately that anime token which is on base ended up just being a pump and dump last but not least we have play SoMo it's not live yet but I figured I would include it in this video because they just announced that it is going to be happening through the portal Crystal dashboard which if you remember people who grinded this made bank right the top Farmers made close or even over a  quarter of a million doar just for farming the social Campaign which is just time and effort right and having a little bit of a presence on social media or being in the right groups or everybody supports each other's posts now they also mention an interesting mechanic here they say you're going to be able to open card packs which could end up being really cool especially since people love you know Pokemon card packs and all that so I'm very excited to see what they have in store portal did really well so this project has a  ton of hype both for their token their mint as well as finally seeing the game because we've only seen teasers so very exciting stuff happening for this project that's it for today's video I hope you enjoyed it if you did be sure to give it a big thumbs up if you haven't already done so would you

Police have trying to find the people responsible for this attack. the investigation. Tourist mob repeatedly chases him down and ultimately beat him senseless. An attack. LAPD is ugly incident captured on cell phone video by Raimondo Taylor and East Hollywood resident who happened to be in the area and the guy tried to pinch back and then that's when everything  happened. And then they went to the state and then one person tried to get a chair and then they knocked them out. The confrontation started because the victim who had just stepped off a subway on Hollywood Boulevard, told a street preacher that he was delivering the wrong message. Several people took offense and resorted to violence. I never seen this in my life, and I thought, okay, it's something gonna happen to me Could they got close to me, so I had to move out of the way, But I was really fighting the mob was  the red shirt. Kicked the victim after he's already down and unconscious He got knocked out in the state and Stephanie started beating them up. And can I have to change the fact that and ugly scene for sure, But people familiar with the area say random attacks are becoming more commonplace. Well I kind of bumped into somebody, and she turned around and just started beating on us at this train station, and like we were LAPD was there to help us? As for Saturday night's attack, Taylor says, thankfully, Not  everyone was out for blood and one lady like him up and protected his head And then they said the guy came up and protected his body and stuff. The victim, identified only as local hospital. His condition remains unknown People we spoke with are using his misfortune to think twice about walking the streets of Hollywood. I saw someone gets shot while walking my dog One time. It's not. I've been right now. It's obviously peaceful, but later in the LAPD investigators still are not releasing the victim's name,  and as of now, no arrests have been made in this case. In downtown Los Angeles.

G113	https://youtu.be/A_yHpO7CyX0?si=HHCE6jzhK3CbYCSe	Everybody loves being around Sarah. She's everybody's best friend. She loves kids. She really does. She has an awesome education. She's a bright girl. But as soon she has that bottle in her hand, that's when the worst side of Sarah comes out. SARAH: First drink is just like, you know, a relief, like, I have alcohol now, like, the rest of the day is fine. If I just want to get, like, a good buzz going and feel good for the whole day, I'll stick to beer. Like, if I'm drunk enough tomorrow, [bleep] yeah.  We're coming here and we're doing karaoke. SARAH: But if I actually want to not remember my night, then I'll go vodka. That's not water, by the way. [chuckles] Yeah, kind of. But, then again, I bought a beer so it kind of evens it out. [ominous music] KOLE: She doesn't really get buzzed, it seems. It's like, right when she's buzzed she immediately gets drunk. Can you help me? Like, I just can't-- OK. This is not working out, like, at all. It's like, she's fine, and then all of a sudden she's completely out of her mind.  Yeah, we were gonna [bleep] drive there, and now Sarah's too [bleep]. Nothing new. SONIA: She's put so much toxins into her body that her body won't last much longer. SARAH: My head hurts all the time. My stomach hurts all the [bleep] time. And until I have a drink, that's when I feel normal. Eventually, something-- I mean, something really bad is gonna happen. You know what I mean? It's not gonna-- you can only get lucky for so long. SONIA: No alcohol tonight. Mom, all I [bleep] want is a bottle of vodka.  SONIA: If you just stop thinking about it and just relax, you're not going to think about it. BRIAN: She basically thinks her body runs off alcohol. She thinks she'll die tomorrow if she doesn't get that next drink. I need it. Please? SONIA: You've got some-- a lot of something in your system. Mom, please. [crying] VICKI: I'm afraid of what'll happen if she keeps drinking. She will die. [hopeful music] LEN: I remember at the hospital, when I held her for the first time, I made her a promise that I  would never let anything hurt her or she would never go without. I remember just running around the house playing with her. Sarah was really good until about high school. [ominous music] Sarah has always been very self-conscious about herself. SARAH: Like, I've always had like an issue with, like, self esteem, self confidence. I feel like every-- every female can go see that. But, for me, I think I'm just, like, I'm way more strict on myself. When she was at school one day, one of the boys had called her fat.  That's when she decided that she was going to do something about it. SARAH: That's when I kind of started, like, watching what I was eating, you know, counting calories. And I went, like, really overboard. Sarah wants to be perfect. And I think Sarah feels like she's not. Things changed for her. She did really well. SARAH: I set goals. And I always did my homework and made sure I was doing good. She was 0.5% away from the honor roll. Yeah. Sarah was-- Sarah was good. Sarah wanted to go. She wanted to experience the world.  A couple of days into her trip was the tsunami and the earthquake that-- that rocked the world. [ominous music] We felt the earthquake and everything and, like, the aftershocks. We were kind of bummed out because our trip got cut short. She was there. She was very angry she had to come home. And when she came home and seen why, she felt guilty for feeling angry. She felt very bad for the people over there. For some reason, Sarah was singled out to be the child that they showed all over Canada. It was Sarah's picture that was on all of the newspapers,  on all of the TVs. When she started watching the newscasts, she felt a very deep sense of guilt. It was weird and overwhelming. My anxiety got intensified. SONIA: Sarah went into her bedroom. For about three weeks, all she did was go to school and come home to her bedroom, barely ate. She barely spoke to us at all. And then we find out later on that's when she was drinking. She was hiding alcohol in her room every night. We thought she was drinking lots of water. It was straight vodka in the water bottles.  SARAH: So it just kind of started as, like, a relaxer for me. My brain, my body-- makes me feel calm, normal. I got to a point where I couldn't even walk in my school anymore and just go to class without having a drink. BRIAN: When she moved up to Kingston, that's when we all noticed she had a pretty big problem. I can remember drinking, like, you know, full bottles of wine before class. Literally every time I would drink I'd black out. She's called me in the middle of the night because she's been completely annihilated  and not known where she was. BRIAN: I visited her twice, maybe three times. Sarah drank a whole 26'er. She'd puke. She'd drink more. She'd repeat, repeat. I got calls 3 o'clock in the morning, you know, the cops just gone and got her. She's at the hospital. LEN: I started noticing the money missing. I found many of 40-ouncers, 26-ers, Mickeys. My dad kept telling her over and over again, you know, if you bring any more alcohol into the house you're getting kicked out. And as soon as he found out she was drunk he said, all right,  enough's enough. He got her to pack up a backpack, throw a coat on, actually kicked her out, said, you have to get going. LEN: We can't function as a family with Sarah, you know, fighting this battle. You know, I'm not giving her any money. I'm not giving her a place to stay. You know, I cut all ties. My dad and my brother don't really talk to me. So, you know, they completely don't trust me anymore just 'cause I have lied over so much. BRIAN: My mom is just so wrapped around Sarah, she's believing every word that she says.  You know what I mean? [chuckles] She's always the one to give in. My sister knows that. Can you run in and please-- please-- Have you drank anything today? No. Why don't you try to go just today without it? OK, seriously. If-- if I go in, it's just to get the edge off, just so you're not feeling-- because you're not feeling good? - Yeah. And I'll save it for-- some for tomorrow. You swear it? Yes. You're not gonna get drunk? Nope. Do you promise it's gonna last you a couple of days? Yup. I promise.  This addiction, your addiction, has consumed my life. [somber music] If you do not accept this help, I will have no choice but support your dad and your brother in their decisions to not support your addictions any longer. And as much as that kills me to say, I mean it. I have to save myself. That's a painful thing for a mom to say. Well, I see that in supporting it I'm enabling her. And I can't do that anymore because I'm killing her. When you're sober, you're an amazing person to be with. You're funny, outgoing, energetic,  and you're such a smart girl. When you're drinking, you're careless and you cut yourself out from us. I have seen things that no younger brother should have ever seen. Sarah, today you will have an opportunity of your lifetime. And the reason I say your lifetime is because I believe this is your last chance at life. So it's my job to ask you, are you ready to accept help today, Sarah. Yeah, I'll go. [hopeful music] - What was that? - I'll go. I'll go. I'll go. SONIA: [crying] Look at your family.  Good choice. You'll go. You'll get healthy there. You'll get the tools that you need in order to recover. I'm so proud of you. SARAH: I didn't think it was possible for me to actually be capable of living a sober, healthy life. Without the alcohol, I'm a pretty independent person. I'm creative. I found I love writing. It's just amazing. I'm just looking forward to my life, 'cause I got my whole life ahead of me now.

you're creating your own courses your own products and your own offers when you build in recurring Revenue that leads to that residual income you're setting your future self up to have to do less work for the same or more income in the future here's how this works let's say you've got a product that's $50 per month and in the first month you bring in 10 people that means you're making  $500 in your first month month and if you keep bringing in 10 new customers each and every month by month 10 by simply selling 10 people per month you're now up to $5,000 per month in Revenue now I've oversimplified that for this little mathematical example because some people churn out you have to be good at getting people to rebuild but the core philosophy of your income compounding when you focus on offers that have recurring Revenue to create residual income it's going to make your life easier in the future so this video  reveals seven different different ways that you can add recurring Revenue into your business starting with number one and I'm going to call this one Evergreen content so you're watching a YouTube video right now and this YouTube video has ads on it my older videos back from 2016 2017 2018 that still get traffic to this day from YouTube those videos I made years and years and years ago are still continuing to deliver some cash flow for me in the form of advertising Revenue the same is true for bloggers  right if you have a Blog where you're running display advertising on your blog you can get residual rewards you can get recurring income from those past efforts and I'm going to go ahead and group in Kindle books with this as well that have royalties obviously it's a little bit different model one could even throw podcasting into this but when you realize that the content that you're creating to grow your audience to get your message out there and to get known in your space and to really attract  people to you that content that you're creating can actually create residual and recurring income for you in the future but I don't recommend that you go all in on that as your only source of income because there's a lot more ways that obviously we're covering here um to generate more residual income faster than that but don't overlook the simple Act of creating content and creating Evergreen content that gets you Revenue via ads number two is to run a paid newsletter now this is not necessarily  going to be applicable to every Niche and none of these ever are but if you're in the marketing world if you're in the finance world if you're in the trading the investing space there's a lot of paid newsletters out there whether it's something that's digital run through substack some people run these kinds of things through patreon and other people actually print and mail out physical newsletters each and every month for Their audience but when you've got a group of professionals who look to you  for advice for what's going on now for these up to the minute Trends you have the potential of selling a $47 month a $97 month I mean some of these newsletters can be hundreds and hundreds of dollars per month for people who are really good at analyzing the market and helping others make really intelligent investing decisions um if you have the ability to create this kind of content over time you have the ability to go build out a recurring Revenue stream through a newsletter itself um number three is group coaching now I've  recently in the new year started a new group coaching program it's called office hours you can learn about it in the link below but the whole reason why I started this office hours program is because I wanted to build more recurring Revenue into my business I wanted more residual income coming into my world so I created one sales letter I've got one offer and essentially I show up every two weeks on zoom and I'm there to answer any of my students questions to help you brainstorm ways to add recurring Revenue to your business to  help you brainstorm list growth email Market marketing uh content marketing strategies etc etc so what I do is I show up on Zoom every other week and that one product allows me to continue to sell it over time and folks who sign up for this will continue to pay month after month after month thus helping me grow a compounding amount of recurring Revenue while all I really actually have to do is keep showing up every other Tuesday at 9:30 a.m. Pacific like I do for the office hours it's a wonderful  business model and with group coaching I'll be honest mine is um extremely in expensive compared to what you would expect in the marketing space but that's cuz I'm just here to really help people and really to put the value forward but you can find some of these um group coaching programs can literally charge thousands of dollars per month um so the amount of Revenue you can stack up goes up quite quickly with these kinds of group coaching programs number four is what I'm going to call communities okay  so this could be a standalone community on a tool like Circle uh circle. Soo is a wonderful kind of a private social network tool or it could be a premium Facebook group but ultimately when people are looking to you as a subject matter expert or as someone who's going to help and or when they look to you as the curator of the best advisors or the best experts on a topic and you've got everybody in one group and you manage that group and others can ask and connect with people inside of that group  they might be willing to pay you for that program and what you see a lot of people doing when they want to build out these types of communities as recurring revenue streams is offering it as an upsell so let's say for example you have a Facebook advertising course that you sell you sell this Facebook advertising course for 97 bucks or 197 or whatever it is well do people want ongoing help from you for $37 a month $97 a month or whatever price you choose you can sell an additional group where they get  access so they can ask you questions inside of the Facebook group um very similar to the group coaching concept that we talked about before but the way I look at the community as being different is they just get to be a part of a group where they can actually ask each other questions and they can answer each other's questions which requires you to be a little bit more of a moderator in that sense versus group coaching they're looking for a mentor right they're looking for you to be the expert to physically roll up your  sleeves and help them with their specific challenges and their specific problems very similar but both of them create the residual income that can allow you to work less and make more in the future number five is soft Ware I love promoting software I've made over a million dollars as an affiliate promoting software and again you don't have to go create the software right you can go find the wonderful software tools that your audience wants and needs and you simply help them understand how to make their lives better you can help  them understand how to use those software tools and for that effort you can ultimately generate recurring revenue streams um one example of this let's say you're an accountant and let's say you help um cryptocurrency Traders and nft Traders man manage all of their books so they can do their taxes effectively I'm assuming there's some sort of a tax software out there that helps with this process and you could be an affiliate for that tax software so you get to go forth creating YouTube videos teaching people how to kind of  prepare their taxes and manage their books and and itemize all of their trades so they can easily do their taxes you're now earning Revenue potentially from those YouTube videos right that's number one but when you show how to use a specific software tool and they Trust you and they click through to follow your step-by-step tutorials and then they purchase that software you can earn uh recurring Revenue month after month after month as long as those people stay connected up to that software which if  you do a good job at teaching them how to use the software to make their lives easier of course they're going to stay as a part of that software one of the tools that I've used software tools that I've done really well with this is keyword research um I've shown everyone how I've utilized keyword research to grow my wife's blog to over 80 million visits this YouTube channel to over 200,000 subscribers and when you see how easy it is to use the tool that I recommend in the super quick way that I  recommend using the tool it's like oh man that's so easy I'm going to go ahead and sign up and then they keep using it they get benefit out of the tool they see their growth increase so they're happy to keep paying for the tool which means I continue to earn income month after month after month so I love software affiliate programs obviously if You' got the skills or the drive or the vision you can create your own software which I've tried to do before but I don't like updating the software I don't  like building out all the bits and pieces and doing customer support for the software so I prefer to be an affiliate marketer in that kind of a scenario because it allows me to just show people how to use it I get to promote it via emails and Via YouTube and when people buy I earn income potentially for years after making that first sale which is the power of residual income right um number six is recurring physical products so this can be anything from consumables to supplements to the box of the month club  um the box of the month club is not as popular as it was a few years ago but there's a wide variety of boxes of the month there could be knitting boxes of the month with different knitting supplies there can be kids boxes of the month there was one my wife and I promoted for a while called goddess provisions and it had crystals and incenses and essential oils and all of those things that um folks in the world of spirituality and metaphysics enjoy and that was a box that we were able to promote at one point in time uh  supplements the whole world of supplements as wide open you could even go to skin care and hair care right if you have physical products that people are consuming well you can also get them to sign up to buy it month after month after month after month which is something that you even see happening on Amazon right when you go to buy dishwasher detergent tabs on amazon.com Amazon's going to say hey do you want us to just B you every month and send these things every month why would Amazon do that because they understand the power  of recurring revenue and the power of residual income in their business but you can apply that to your business as as well and I mentioned consumables so at one point in time uh Sean my ad guy and I were thinking about creating a coffee creamer that had neut Tropics in it which is like healthy brain stuff and healthy immune system stuff inside of the coffee creamer and our whole idea was that we were going to get people on monthly Auto ships for those products so not only are you just buying our coffee  creamer but you're essentially saying yes I want a bag of coffee creamer every two weeks forever and then what we just do is go continue to sell more and the volume of coffee creamer that we're selling and the revenue that we're generating compounds month after month after month right if you bring in 10 new customers in month one and you earn $50 off of each of those customers you made $500 on month one but after 10 months of bringing in 10 customers per month at 50 bucks each now you're earning $5,000 per  month because all of those sales and all of that Revenue compounds over time number seven our final one is probably the one I like the most I save the best for last for those folks who clicked back out of the video so if you're still here with me at number number 7 1% good on you please give me a thumbs up give me a like on this video uh help me help the algorithm get this out to more people who want to add residual income to their business but the basic membership program so what is a membership program well it's essentially  where you deliver something that your audience values each and every month or every two weeks so one example of this could be a hypnotherapist who creates a new Mp3 hypnotherapy session that they send out and they can have a group of people who have all raised their hands and said yes for 20 $7 per month or $47 per month I want to get a new hypnotherapy session from you each and every week and then your job is to go create that MP3 each and every week and you send it out to your audience and you  grow it starts with one then you got 10 customers then you got a 100 customers and you keep doing the same thing right you just keep creating one new Mp3 a week or whatever your deliverable schedule is on that you keep sending it out to that whole list of people people who purchase but the amount of income the recurring residual income that you earn goes up and up and up as you bring in more people because everyone's signing up to purchase each and every month another example would be like a law of attraction group that uh did a  new affirmation or manifestation audio or video each every month or every two weeks yet another example of this would be if you create beats music beats you could have MC's rappers you could have uh Music Makers actually sign up and say yes I want one New Beat from you each and every week you create one new beat you send it out your whole group and you can grow the group of people who are purchasing that from you right so you can start at 50 bucks a month you get 10 people in that's 500 bucks a month you  grow it up to 100 people over 10 months by bringing in 10 customers per month which is relatively easy to do let's be real um and you now have yourself $5,000 a month recurring revenue for making one new beat per month so there's a lot of ways that you can add recurring income and residual income into your business and not all of these Ways work for every business but it's important for you to be thinking about the ways that you can add on recurring Revenue into your business and if you don't already have  the skills or the competency of creating your own products you might want to actually just learn how to find the best affiliate products that you can add recurring Revenue to your business by promoting other people who have that residual component built in if you want to learn my trick for finding the high dollar recurring Revenue affiliate program that I've used so you can apply this to any Niche please please please go through my offer Recon video the link to that video will be in the description  down below I share my process for finding the absolute best affiliate programs because they're not on the big clickbanks they're not on the big affiliate networks you have to kind of reverse engineer your way to finding those really hot affiliate offers that your audience is going to love um and final note if you want my help adding recurring and residual income into your business

G130	https://youtu.be/RPRNa2TmztA?si=ZH79IKek8fwqLvwY	I want to play a moment for you from John Stewart on The Daily Show and before doing that I want to give you the context of what he's responding to a moment took place on Fox News during their coverage of the eclipse that caught a lot of people's attention including John Stewart's because it was a strange subject they tried to uh fit into their discussion of the eclipse and if you haven't seen this already you can probably guess what is Fox news talk all the time about the southern border and they were able somehow to connect the  concept of the eclipse to the discussion of the Southern border and what they call a policy failure on the part of Joe Biden at the border now we'll address those claims again as we have so many times in the past after walking through a couple of these clips first here is the Fox news coverage then we'll get to John Stewart's response to it hilarious mocking the fox hosts for this absurd coverage and then I'll respond cesal event collide with a policy failure on the ground the southern border will be  directly in the path of totality today when the moon covers the Sun for nearly four minutes and welcome to a brand new hour of America's Newsroom I'm Dana Pina we are one hour closer we are we are as a lot of buildup that's right I'm Bill H good morning at home but that is that is sorry this is unrelated to the topic of them trying to force the southern border to be a part of this conversation but I did want to say it was funny watching so many anchors even confused at the coverage they were doing across all networks they  were like wait we're covering the eclipse that people presumably would go outside to look at but I guess covering the eclipse in totality for people who aren't in places where they could get that view and we're going to do a buildup and a countdown just all of it was a strange tone and tener coming from these hosts team totality on the other side of the wall by the way what a studio they have our folks at Fox Weather are dialed in on this so beautiful don't overlook that check it out uh we are told that officials are  bracing for higher traffic than usual and that means a real opportunity for Smugglers and cartels and migrants to come right in uh Fox News has reporters far and wide following the total solar eclipse as it crosses the us but the first location of totality is actually the southern border and that's where we find Bill maluan live in Eagle Pass Texas the place that you are well familiar with Bill good morning yeah Bill good morning to you we got double duty down here in Eagle Pass today Eagle Pass actually expected to be  the very first spot in all the United States where the totality of this Eclipse so before I give my thoughts and actually there's something optimistic I have to say let me show you this and you'll see the repeat of the clip I just played for you apologies for that but it'll nicely segue into John Stewart's response on The Daily Show a Fox News Alert a rare Celestial event collides with a policy failure on the ground the southern border will be directly in the path of totality today when the moon  covers the Sun for nearly 4 minutes we are told that officials are bracing for higher traffic unusual and that means a real opportunity for Smugglers and cartels and migrants to come right in or they could just wait till night time they really they don't have the eclipse 4 minutes I got to say is there nothing Fox can't tie to immigration this is this is cicada infestation provides perfect cover for Venezuelans so John Stewart is correct to mock the fox hosts for their absurd coverage I do think there's a broader uh  phenomenon that's being represented here obviously that's one example of fox host doing strange coverage of the eclipse and trying to include the Border but it represents this broader Obsession in rightwing Med among Republican politicians in Fox News specifically obviously with the southern border and before I get to what I think is actually a hopeful takeaway from that phenomenon if you can believe it to address the subject itself again if we want to have a policy conversation which I love having about the southern border and the  issues which there are issues relating to our Southern border and our immigration system broadly then it has to be made clear Maga Republicans clearly are not the one ser serous about addressing those issues with policy Solutions and doing so in a meaningful level-headed way because when there was a solution brought forward they just killed it didn't want to negotiate didn't want to have any part of it the bipartisan border deal the border patrol Union very strongly endorsed it James Langford a conservative senator from  Alabama helped to craft and he supported it and Maga Republicans at the direction of Donald Trump because he wants to run on this issue in the election thus wants it to be as bad as possible so we can justify this wild fear-mongering and dehumanization he directed these mag Republicans to kill that deal so they're not serious so they're clearly not a part right now you can join it if you want if you'll be a little bit more reasonable but they're not a part of this policy discussion about Solutions  they're obstructing the solutions so that has to be made clear but despite that fact right-wing media has been effective in politically benefiting the right Republicans uh with this issue and that why despite it not aligning with the fact that's why Fox News sees this as a political benefit and obsesses over it constantly but the hopeful takeaway setting that conversation aside that we've had so many times about the policy itself and who serious about addressing issues the fact that they focus on this  so much proves they don't have much else and I think that's hopeful that they're losing on so many issues Reproductive Rights they don't want to talk about that democ Ry they don't want to talk about that and even the economy they used to talk about do you remember they used to attack Biden constantly over the economy you've heard less about that probably and the reason is because people are starting to experience the reality we've been talking about for some time we've seen the metrics but now  people are feeling those metrics the ramifications of those metrics in their lives and seeing that the story of Biden's presidency is overseeing this stunning recovery from the disaster the economy and shambles that he was handed because of the pandemic and the mishandling of that pandemic by his predecessor and so yes there was and still is so much pain but the story of Biden's presidency is minimizing that and trying to address that and overseeing the recovery from the worst of that and that means now  just a few years after the worst of that devastating pandemic that caused the social public health and economic crisis that again Trump was is handling and handed that disaster to Joe Biden now we're in a situation where we we've had a lower unemployment for longer than we've seen in 50 years stronger job growth than almost any time in American history the uh stock market is breaking records real wage growth we're experiencing and so as people feel that Fox News realizes okay ah dang it we can't talk about that issue too much  either then you have crime they've tried their very best and they're still trying and they've smush that into the Border issue with this migrant crime fearmongering tool but if people actually observe the conditions on the ground and we're seeing this in the statistics Nationwide crime has been plummeting under Joe Biden largest increase in homicide rates in 2020 under Donald Trump because of the pandemic conditions and his mishandling of them one of the largest plummets in homicide rates under Joe Biden and uh violent  crime right now at near 50-year lows so low to be clear than under Trump even before the crisis that caused the spike in crime pretty impressive stuff so the facts don't align with obsessing over that issue either then if you want to get into a policy conversation oh no policy are they going to talk about Trump's one major would you call it legislative achievement being cutting taxes disproportionately for those at the top of the economic ladder that's probably not the best thing to talk about in an election year for Donald  Trump on Fox News and espe when you contrast that to Joe Biden's record the American Rescue plan helping to get people out of the pandemic crisis that we were in the inflation reduction act expanding ACA coverage the lowering of prescription drug cost for seniors the packed act expanding health care for veterans investing in American manufacturing with the chips and science act the infrastructure law large investment infrastructure since the Eisenhower Highway program people seeing Investments and projects in their  communities making their communities better improving their Airport improving their roads and bridges Broadband clean and reliable drinking water so you do a policy comparison that's not good for Fox new and actually I think about this a lot when I go through that list in my head if Fox News did just basic minimal coverage of Biden's actual policy record not the weird myth of Biden that they've created where he's like a communist or something but the actual Biden then they would just convince their viewers to  like him probably because these policies are aimed at benefiting all Americans working-class Americans and uplifting people whether or not they're Maga or someone else and so I think they would actually end up helping Biden if they would cover his actual policy record actually I know that would help given how well these issues poll so then if you don't have the economy talk about crime you don't have the facts on you don't have a policy related conversation comparing the two individuals policy records because they've both been  president what should you go to character okay we won't talk about any of those things but what about their character that's not good for Donald Trump he's a civil liable rapist and uh many other horrible things probably not the best conversation is talk about who they are as people and so what are you left with the Border that's it that's why they obsess so much over this issue and so then that's their Hammer as many people have been saying when all you have is a hammer everything looks like nails the Border has to be injected into  every single conversation imaginable and this is hopeful because it means they don't have much and that means if we can better message and correct the record on the subject of the Border then they got nothing and we have to get that message to people yeah you're going to hear a lot of fearmongering a lot of wild rhetoric let me tell you about the policy let me tell you about the reality on the ground and what either side's interested in doing across multiple issues including this one make sure you subscribe to the  channel 	Liberal			Liberal	70

G154	https://youtu.be/hkqXK7nsvW0?si=sDEJDwlyT87Hub1I	[Music] on the outside I was doing a lot of the Performing the tat dancing of like the the smile and the showing up and landing on my mark and I'm going to just do what I need to do and be this you know happy go-lucky Nickelodeon kid my name is Samantha Pucket I'm from Seattle and I love fried chicken but inside I was hurting it was painful I was angry I felt unsupported you pull back the curtain on child stardom it is not a pretty picture not as I see it no at just 15 Janette MCC was one of the most recognizable child  stars on television playing Sam Pucket in Nickelodean hit show I Carly where' my straw go here to her millions of fans she was known as the funny BFF but she says behind that bubbly onscreen Persona nothing about her real life was funny for you what were the pitfalls of child Fame you're playing a an adult's game you're in an adult's world and you don't recognize that you're incapable of being on that level but you are confused and you think that you are and I think it really leads to um stunted personal development her  personal struggles eventually prompting her to abandon acting altogether you say quite frankly that this was never your dream stardom was never your dream whose dream was it my mom's I think she wanted me to have a better life than she had but I also think her approach was very unhealthy and informed by her own lack of self-work and she lived vicariously through me Janette had her first audition at age six encouraged by her late Mom Deborah their mother daughter bond deeply disordered and chaotic she  says her family struggled financially over time like so many other child stars her acting paid the bills felt like a lot of pressure and then I think my mom saw my career as a way out of that life of that way of living of that constant grind how chaotic was that childhood home you describe it with one line that stuck with me that the air in the house felt like a held breath it was really complicated my mom also had cancer when I was 2 years old that was the first time she was diagnosed So Not only was  it chaotic because of the abuse that was happening um and my mom's violent and erratic unstable Behavior but also because we all lived in fear of her cancer coming back that volatile relationship is at the center of janette's dark and deeply personal Memoir I'm glad my mom died what made you pick that I think I earned that title through the writing of the book but I wanted it to be something that would grab people's attention and get them to pick up the book and then hopefully learn by the end of it why I  have chosen that title from the 10er age of 11 she says her mother taught her the dangerous habit of calorie restriction which would turn into years of Eating Disorders in many ways your mother tried to keep you a child I think my mom wanted to keep me as controllable uh as possible I think she really wanted to have her influence on me and Me growing Up was a threat to that the key to that was calor restriction absolutely I think my mom encouraged and conditioned my anorexia because both she thought that it would  in some ways help my career and also because it served her goal of keeping me young and under her influence the book reveals Dark episodes of her childhood that for years Janette says she blocked out she describes how her mother would give her showers and touch her invasively until she was a teenager she referred to them as medical exams on your private parts yes this was the hardest part of the book for me to write about it was a really emotional experience I laughed during the writing of it and then I cried a lot after I  after I wrote that vignette you talk about basically having outof body associations out of body experiences when this is happening to you yeah what do you think was going on I've tried to understand and that didn't lead me anywhere productive I would just spin my wheels trying to understand my mom's motives this continued until you were 17 yeah and you describe in the book that you felt violated yes I absolutely felt violated and eventually accepting that was the most I think integral piece to my own healing and recovery at the  height of her stardom she landed a spin-off series Sam and cat starring alongside future pop star Ariana Grande she writes about tensions on the set see what you said say it again one more time I said I'm really SM you literally wrote I frequently made the mistake comparing my career to Ariana's and being jealous of everything jealous of her childhood jealous of a music career that you didn't even want sure I was je specifically that she played charades with Tom Hanks that's what got me Charades with Tom Hanks how dare she I  know but I was so young at the time and I think it's really hard to not compare yourself to somebody at that age when you're in an environment around them all the time um so I made that mistake repeatedly and and I'm I'm uh I'm glad to be at a place now where I wouldn't trade positions with somebody as the show was airing her mother died of cancer Janette says her life was spinning out of control anorexia morphing into bulimia and alcohol abuse I was never aiming for bulimia I was attempting to have  anorexia but I couldn't keep it up without my mom so then that would lead to I'd starve myself for so long and then I'd binge and then I'd Purge because I I hated the feeling of fullness hated it it would take Janette years to seek proper help and start therapy to begin grappling with her trauma I couldn't initially accept the idea that my mother was abusive toward me because my whole way of life my whole way of going through the world was I was operating through this lens of my mom wants what's  best for me even after she died I'm nothing without my mom I can't do anything without my mom I'm incapable I'm incompetent what would Mom want what would Mom think what does Mom need that accepting that she was abusive would have meant reframing my entire life and that felt impossible I couldn't go near that for a long time Janette says that building a new life without her mom began with a stunning decision to leave acting behind why quit acting it was important for my recovery at the time it represented my  mom living vicariously through me it represented something that my mom wanted that I didn't want so it was important for me to step away in a very definitive way and really just focus on completely on healing myself reflecting back on her career janette's critical of the Hollywood Machine and the world she was exposed to at such a young age in her book she writes that after Sam and Cat was cancelled Nickelodeon offered her a $300,000 thank you gift if she agreed to never speak publicly about her  experience at the network specifically with a man she refers to as the Creator who on one occasion she says encouraged her to drink while she was still underage and gave her a shoulder massage in response Nickelodeon telling ABC News we have no reportable response other than a no comment at this time I just said no it's not happening that sounds like hush money to me not doing it not taking it and then I do remember leaning against I think I talk about this in the book but I lean against my bed and I'm  like well shoot that could have put my nieces through college like that was some good money but I am ultimately proud of of my decision there um wherever it came from even if it was informed by self-righteousness I think that uh I think I did something that was really hard to do oh my God it makes emotional I'm proud of myself why why proud of yourself I think I've chosen a path of integrity and it hasn't always been easy now 30 Janette says she's recovered from years of eating disorders and found a  sense of balance for the first time in her life what's your body image now and what's your relationship to food like and how do you sort of go about your day I'm glad you ask this because when people talk about eating to recovery they talk about it being such an ongoing process and something you deal with every single day for the rest of your life and it's always a battle and I think that kind of language it doesn't help motivate I'm at a place now where I don't obsess about food at all I hav't  engaged in any sort of disordered eating um behavior for years I'm really proud of that um Janette says healing also comes through in her writing she's working on a novel and a collection of essays and while she sees herself as a writer she hasn't

G201	https://youtu.be/LW_rTeawAi0?si=QrynLdlqgG95DLX3	[MUSIC PLAYING]  SARAH JESSOP: Norwegian theorist Johann Galtung developed a three-layered understanding of violence that represents how a confluence of factors merge, in particular historical moments, to shape the conditions for the promotion of violence. Direct violence is what we normally think of when we think about violence. It represents behaviors that serve to threaten life itself, and or to diminish one's capacity to meet basic human needs, such as killing, maiming, bullying, sexual assault,  and emotional manipulation. Structural violence represents the systematic ways in which some groups are hindered from equal access to opportunities to goods and services that enable the fulfillment of basic human needs. These can be formal, as in legal structures that enforce marginalization, such as apartheid in South Africa. Or they could be informal but common practices, such as limited access to education or health care for marginalized groups. Cultural violence represents the existence of prevailing or prominent social norms that  make direct and structural violence seem natural or right, or at least acceptable. For example, the belief that Africans are primitive and intellectually inferior to Caucasians gave sanction to the African slave trade. Galtung's understanding of cultural violence helps explain how prominent beliefs can become so embedded in a given culture that they function as absolute and inevitable, and are reproduced uncritically across generations. These three forms of violence are interrelated and mutually reinforcing,  and understanding them better is crucial for the pursuit of a broader and deeper peace. 	Liberal			Conservative	75
G216	https://youtu.be/0e8jciiVk-Y?si=SWxEYoNhHr-iSDXU	OJ SIMPSON: Oh boy, I don't know how I ended up here. I-- I just don't know how I ended up here. I thought I lived a great life. I went out of my way to make everybody comfortable and happy. I felt very lonely at times in recent years. I mean, everybody loves me, but I don't know why I was feeling so alone all the time. And there was things that were happening in my life that I guess caught up to me. MAN: OJ-- REPORTER: Simpson's image and his-- the greatest ever to play the game. NARRATOR: He is the most famous American ever charged  with murder. I've had nightmares about hearing her voice, telling me he's gonna kill her. NARRATOR: Tonight, Simpson's closest friends and confidantes break their silence. It was a very crazy situation. This is somebody who I've known since I was seven years old, I used to call Uncle OJ. OJ SIMPSON: I never punched her, yes. INTERROGATOR: You ever strike her? OJ SIMPSON: No. INTERROGATOR: You ever hurt her? OJ SIMPSON: Yes. NARRATOR: Video and audiotapes reveal the true personality of one of America's most controversial celebrities.  He had this dark, angry, bitter side. And you could see it in his eyes. And Nicole told me, "you don't know what he's capable of." He loved to control people. NARRATOR: And interviews with Robert Kardashian, one of Simpson's closest friends, who stood by him throughout the trial-- ROBERT KARDASHIAN: From day one I never suspected anything. Well, now what? That was so shocking to me because I had never heard that before. ROBERT KARDASHIAN: I needed to find out the truth. He didn't know how to get out if he wanted to.  NARRATOR: --including an audio recording made by Simpson in his darkest hour and kept secret for years. OJ SIMPSON: There was things that caught up to me. I had a great life. Please remember me as The Juice. Please remember me as a good guy. Don't remember me as one of the negatives that might end up here. MAN: Let me look into the eyes of OJ Simpson. I couldn't kill anyone. I couldn't do it. REPORTER: Shocking and tragic news from Brentwood, California-- the bloody body of Nicole Brown Simpson, ex-wife of football hero OJ Simpson,  was found outside her home. Also found was the body of an unidentified man. ROBIN GREER: I had just turned on the morning news, you know, to get ready for work. And I heard that OJ Simpson's wife had been murdered. It was just shocking. I was totally in a state of shock. I couldn't-- I couldn't imagine what had happened. REPORTER: Reports also indicate both victims' throats were slashed. At 6:30 in the morning, I was awakened by horrible-- I mean, worse than any horror movie scream you've ever, ever heard, horrific.  And then somebody told us that it was on the news. And all I remember is my mom and I, we were standing in the living room. She was holding my hand. And she goes, "That's my kid." KRIS KARDASHIAN JENNER: I mean, it was like the room started to spin. And your heart starts to go. It was so awful, like you don't even know what's happening. I walked in the door at the end of the day and heard my wife scream out, "Fred, there's somebody on the phone, something's happened to Ron." And the two of us, my wife and I,  stood there, crying our eyes out. Couldn't possibly have I ever imagined that would happen to us. FRED LEVINSON: Well, I felt-- you know, I felt very upset. I got very upset that was-- that she was murdered. And it was the way she was murdered. I mean, somebody could put a bullet in you, but it's not as bad as having your-- almost beheading somebody. When that happens, you know, it was a passion. Somebody did that, really angry. OJ SIMPSON: I had a great life. I had some great friends. But I love you all, my kids.  They'll probably never hear this. And I don't want them to hear it. But Sydney and Justin, your mother loved you so much. And I loved you. And I loved your mother. And if there was any problem in our relationship, maybe there was too much love. REPORTER: Since the news of the murders, Simpson's Brentwood estate has been the site of growing media frenzy. People trying to push each other out of the way. KRIS KARDASHIAN JENNER: When I saw it on television, it was so shocking to see the circus that was developing  outside of OJ's house. And I knew then that if anybody could handle the situation, it was Robert. Robert was one of those people that could always go take care of the situation. And he's also OJ's best friend. And it was so like Robert to be there for a friend in a time of need. Whatever happened, Robert didn't think. He just went. That was his nature. LAWRENCE SCHILLER: And I get a phone call from Robert Kardashian. And Robert says, "Larry, I need your help. I don't know how we're going to handle this.  We've got the press and this and that. I may need some advice, Larry. I said, well, call me when you need me. And I'm here to help you. Kardashian was a very close friend of mine. And I tried to impress upon Kardashian to preserve this entire tragedy. I interviewed him almost every single day. ROBERT KARDASHIAN: I didn't go over to OJ's home looking for publicity and looking to get involved in the case. I went over to support my friend. And I said, you know, you can't stay here. There's all this press outside.  Why don't you come and stay at my house for a couple of days and then you could come back? It'll all blow over by then and you could return. ROBIN GREER: Robert Kardashian and Kris were really good friends with OJ and Nicole. They loved him. You know, he was their best friend and their good time. You know, they did business together. They went skiing together. They played sports together. And there was a camaraderie amongst those guys that you couldn't shake. KRIS KARDASHIAN JENNER: OJ was one of the groomsmen at my wedding.  We all bonded. There was great chemistry. It was great friendship, a great life. MAN: When did you first meet Nicole? Summer of 1977. MAN: Where did you meet her? OJ SIMPSON: At a place called The Daisy. MAN: In Beverly Hills? Yes. The Daisy was sort of a place where you'd get together for lunch. And then at night, it was a discotheque. Nicole was a waitress there, actually, at The Daisy. DAVID LEBON: Lo and behold, guess who comes in? It's OJ, and sees Nicole at the hostess stand and, you kind, of makes an eye contact.  ROBIN GREER: Nicole was really outgoing, very athletic. She's funny and just a lot of fun to be with. MAN: When did you first meet Nicole? The day OJ met her. And I don't know the date. KRIS KARDASHIAN JENNER: When OJ first met Nicole, I had walked into the house. And OJ was like, "Perfect, you're home." And then he goes, "I'm making a phone call. When somebody picks up the phone, say, "Is Nicole there?" And I said, "What? Who are you calling?" And he said, "This really beautiful girl that I met named Nicole.  But I want you to ask for her because she lives with her parents." DAVID LEBON: She goes, "Dave, guess what? OJ Simpson, he's asked me out." And I said, "Well, you know he's married and has a couple children? Are you sure you want to do this? And she goes, "Yes." She comes home. And I go, "How did it go?" "Oh, it went great. He's so charming and everybody knows who he is. And he's-- he's so famous. It's just unbelievable, you know. And all of a sudden, I see her jeans have been ripped. And I said, "what.  Happened?" And she goes, "David, well, he was just a little forceful. I said, "What do you mean, a little forceful? On your first day you're going to let him be a little forceful?" "David, I think I like this guy." MAN: Nicole was how old at the time? 18. And you were how old? I believe twen-- oh, 28, 29 maybe. MAN: 29? Yep. MAN: Were you married? Yes. She was just a child, you know, and he was still married. And he sort of swooped her off her feet and courted her. DAVID LEBON: And I think it was something like four  or five days later, she says, "Well, OJ has an apartment for me. And he bought me a new car. And I said, "What?" If you think about when you're 17 and what your life experience is and what molds your feelings for the next few years of your life, it was all him. She didn't have her own identity. She was OJ's girlfriend and then OJ's wife. [cheering] [wedding music] [chanting] I'd just like to say that we're very proud of OJ. He's finally done it. KRIS KARDASHIAN JENNER: OJ and Nicole, we're very happy for you today.  Nicole, you really hung in there. We're so proud of you. And we're very happy. And we hope you guys are happy and healthy and have a nice, long, happy life together. Thank you for having us here. It was a very exciting time in all of our lives because we were all happy and young. And everybody started having kids. And it was just a really amazing group of friends. Hi, little one. OJ SIMPSON: Hey, little one. She doesn't look like a Black baby, OJ? OJ SIMPSON: Well, she's our baby. Oh yeah, she's thinking about something real nice.  She's thinking about what a-- her daddy's rich and her mama's good looking. That's what she's thinking about. This is a man who was great from high school on. He won the Heisman Trophy and then was propelled into national football and then went on to a big acting career. So he became one of the biggest stars in the world. So it's really hard to separate a grandiose view of yourself from the actual fact that people do worship you. Everyone was mesmerized by him. So you didn't really know that he  had this moody, dark, angry, bitter side that Nicole saw. And I don't think he showed that side to very many people. OJ SIMPSON: There's people out there that know some things that have transpired recently that-- and this is not stuff I'm sure I should be saying right now, but this is just what's on my mind. I just don't know how I ended up here. REPORTER: Detectives have been questioning OJ Simpson about the murders of his former wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and Ronald Goldman, a 26-year-old waiter  from a nearby restaurant. INTERROGATOR: OK, do you wish to give up your right to remain silent and talk to us? OJ SIMPSON: Uh, yes. INTERROGATOR: OK, and you give up your right to an attorney present while we talk? OJ SIMPSON: Yes. TOM LANGE: The first impression I had of him was he's very impressed with himself and he believes he can handle anything, very narcissistic. I felt that he felt he could handle a couple of cops. LAURIE LEVENSON: Howie Weitzman's a really good lawyer. And he was the first lawyer called up  when OJ was being asked to answer questions for the LAPD. I have no doubt in my mind that Howard had said to him, "Don't answer these questions." But OJ is the kind of guy, we saw over and over again, who just does what he wants to do. He actually thinks he knows best. TOM LANGE: Something we noticed when he walked in the office, his left hand was bleeding. Now you're thinking, left glove off at the crime scene, someone dropped a left glove and he's got an injury in the left hand, blood trail leading from the crime scene  on the left side, the footwear impressions towards the alley. Whoever did this is bleeding from the left side of his body. INTERROGATOR: OJ, we've got sort of a problem. OJ SIMPSON: Mhm? INTERROGATOR: We've got some blood on and in your car. We've got some blood at your house. We've got, of course, the cut on your finger that you weren't real clear on. OJ SIMPSON: That was last night. INTERROGATOR: OK, so then last night you fell. This is not going to be a case of someone who's going to confess to anything, especially not this guy  and this personality. He felt that he would handle this and we were going to let him handle it. GREGORY CASON: Why would anyone ever suspect him? I think he'd be the last person people would suspect, in his mind at least, because he was a god. He was an icon. That's just reality of the world he lived in. INTERROGATOR: Did Nicole have words with you last night? OJ SIMPSON: No, not at all. INTERROGATOR: You haven't had any problems with her lately, have you? OJ? OJ SIMPSON: [exhales sharply] I always have problems with her.  You know, I-- I-- that's our relationship, has been a problem relationship. And it just didn't work. INTERROGATOR: Did you ever hit her, OJ? OJ SIMPSON: Uh, yep, that one night we had a fight, that night. INTERROGATOR: That night we had a fight? OJ SIMPSON: And she hit me. RON SHIPP: In 1989, I was just leaving the LAPD. But before I left, OJ got in a tiff with his wife. I got a call from the downstairs front desk. "Hey, Ron, there's a young lady down here that wants to say hi to you for a minute."  And there was Nicole. And I looked at her face. And I could tell she had heavy makeup on. I could tell that there was marks, bruises on her face. She got real serious. And she just said, "you know, Ron, he did it to me." She goes, "He-- you know, he-- he did it." JOE KOLKWITZ: Nicole ended up going to the hospital. She was definitely thrown or hurt or fell. And I was with him the next day. And we were trying to find out where she was, because AC had taken her somewhere. AL COWLINGS: We walked into the emergency room.  The lady said, "How did you sustain your injuries?" INTERROGATOR: And what did Nicole say? Nicole kind of hesitated a little bit. And I don't-- she mumbled something or she said something. I don't remember. And she looked at me, and I said, "Nicole, you got to tell them the truth." RON SHIPP: She broke down and started crying. You know, now, Nicole, everybody that knows her, she's a pretty tough woman, you know? And I had never ever seen her like that, ever. But I'm sitting there totally in shock.  You know, she was hurt. And I think she said something about her being the victim. And she was concerned that everybody was going to side with OJ. RON SHIPP: This is OJ Simpson. This is a superstar. This is a guy that America loves. Look at all he has to lose. He'll never hit her again. INTERROGATOR: You were easily able to overpower her physically. Is that right? No, that's incorrect. INTERROGATOR: She was-- she was a match for you physically? Yes, in that sense, in the way I was trying to remove her,  she was a match. INTERROGATOR: And you never once raised your fist to her and hit her? No, that's correct. INTERROGATOR: Did you ever once raise your hand and slap her? No, I didn't. INTERROGATOR: Did you strike her? No, I didn't. INTERROGATOR: Did you see that she was bleeding during this exchange? She never bled once at any time there, at the police station. Nobody gave her a Kleenex. Nobody wiped blood off her. There was not one drop of blood anywhere on that scene that day of that night. INTERROGATOR: Mr. Cowlings, I'm going to ask  you to look at this picture. It's been previously marked as Exhibit Number 45, ask if you recognize that picture. Yes. INTERROGATOR: And who do you recognize that to be? (CRYING) Nicole. INTERROGATOR: And does that appear to be the way that Nicole looked when you went over there that early morning time after watching-- (CRYING) Hey, man, give me a break. RON SHIPP: OJ asked me the questions about a lie detector test. And he said he didn't want to take it. And I said, "Why don't you want to take it?"  We kind of chuckled. He says, "You know, to be perfectly honest, Shipp, I have had dreams of killing her." And I thought to myself, wow. I remember just about everybody I knew that failed a lie detector test will always give you some kind of excuse as to why they're going to fail it. And now he had just given me an excuse. And I'm thinking, "Oh my God." I think he did. I think he actually killed her her. LAWRENCE SCHILLER: OJ's attorney arranged for him to take a secret polygraph test. OJ failed that test, minus 22, virtually the worst  score you could get. ROBERT KARDASHIAN: You want to believe that he didn't do it. From day one I never suspected anything. Well, now what? You know, the doubt and insecurity goes through you. And you say, "Well, shoot, what if he really did it?" And, of course, this result was hidden for many, many, many months. REPORTER: Simpson emerged from seclusion to attend the funeral of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson. He was accompanied by their two young children. We drove to the funeral. It was a scene.  It was helicopters and news cameras all over. And it just seemed like a movie. It didn't even seem like it was happening. KRIS KARDASHIAN JENNER: All eyes were definitely on OJ. It was a very confusing time. And you don't want to believe what everybody else is starting to insinuate. I remember at the wake for Nicole, you're seeing her laying in the casket. She had to-- they had to have a collar around her neck because her head was almost severed. And he was standing over her. You know, he was there.  And then he came up to me. And he said, "I am so sorry. I am so sorry." And I knew in that moment that he really was. I mean, he did it. And he-- but it's probably the only time I ever saw him look sorry. KRIS KARDASHIAN JENNER: I lost Nicole. I also lost him as a friend and had to realize that all those years of everything that we went through together or shared, it was over. INTERROGATOR: Do you recall any conversation you had with Judy Brown that night at the wake? OJ SIMPSON: Yes. INTERROGATOR: OK, could you tell me what she said to you  and what you said to her? I believe she said, "You didn't do this." And I said, "No, Judy, I love Nicole." I'm The Juice, whatever that means. But I felt at times like I was-- I felt the goodness in myself and the goodness that I gave people. I don't feel any goodness in myself right now. ANNOUNCER: Ferguson and the handoff to OJ. OJ cuts left. He makes it all the way. Touchdown, OJ. That's history being made today. And we're proud to be a part of it. Oh, OJ Simpson. You know, the image I had of OJ,  just growing up and seeing him, is the incredibly likable guy, the Heisman Trophy winner. And then he did the Hertz commercials. And you just instinctively liked the guy. You thought he was a nice guy. He had endorsements and was doing Hertz commercials. And he was very well loved by everyone who he ran into. JOE SIMPSON: People meet you in the streets. And they always ask you what it is to have a son, you know, as famous as OJ, and how you feel about it. And I tell them I-- I just relaxed and stretched to break all the buttons  off my shirt and have them sewed on the next week. We're very proud of him. GREGORY CASON: OJ, when you start to look at his background, had some odds to overcome. And he did overcome them, growing up in the projects in San Francisco. INTERROGATOR: When you were a youth, were you involved in any gang fights? Yes. INTERROGATOR: Were you a participant? Yes. INTERROGATOR: Did you use a knife in any of those? No. INTERROGATOR: What weapons did you use? Fists. INTERROGATOR: Other than using your fists, did you have any--  involved in any physical confrontations with other instruments? I think we ran a gang off the hill once with rocks, throwing rocks at them. INTERROGATOR: How old were you when you were involved with gangs as a youth? 13, 14, 15. He had a difficult relationship with his father and stopped talking to him for a long time. I was raised a certain way and I know you reach a point with a kid that you got to let them know who's boss. INTERVIEWER: How old is-- My kid knows who's boss. INTERVIEWER: How old is your son?  OJ SIMPSON: My son is 14. So I got to-- you know, I got to prove my point with him now. I got to get this kid morally and ethically straight now, because in about a year or so, I think his reach is gonna be a little better than mine. I'll be in a little trouble. INTERVIEWER: You mean you've duked it out with him as you had-- have you really? Oh, we have duked out, oh yeah. We had a duke out just recently. You actually had a little fight with your son? Oh, a little boxing match. I had to let him know that--  You mean you were in the ring with him? Oh no, in my front yard. When you reach a point you can provide for yourself, you think that you're a little tougher than I am right now. Well, you're on your own. I mean, you can go and do it. But until that time comes, you're gonna have to do it my way. FRED LEVINSON: He loved to control people. When we were over there playing poker, you couldn't leave until he said to leave. One of my best friends would have to call me at 9:30 to tell me I had to leave, I had to do something in order  to get out of the house. And it was his way of the highway. You know, but that was his personality. DAVID LEBON: OJ was one of those guys that always had to win. But I can remember going down to the Browns and he was there. And he'd have to win at Monopoly. I mean, it just didn't matter. It was just always about OJ. OJ SIMPSON: One of the things I wanted most as a kid growing up in the ghetto was not money. It was fame. I wanted to be known. I wanted people to say, "Hey, there goes OJ." There's a lot of things I need as a person.  You know, I need-- I need that recognition. You know, I need friendships, a lot of friendships. And I'm trying to say I think that what is driving OJ Simpson is that need to be known, that need to be liked, the need to be-- say "Hey, that's OJ Simpson." When I walk down the street, I want people to know me. ROSS BECKER: He was the guy that got all the girls. He was the guy that got all the attention. I think that's what he wanted. I think that's what his handlers wanted. I think that's what OJ Simpson became in addition to being  a football player. He also became a star, a celebrity, and a playboy. FRED LEVINSON: He was very desirable. And he knew it. And he would hit on all the women, because once you become a celebrity, the world is what you want it to be. You want that? You got it. You can get away with anything. And the wife has to either live with it or walk away. WOMAN (AS NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON): Right now I'm so angry. If I didn't know that the courts would take Sydney and Justin away from me if I did this, I would sleep with every guy,  including some that you know, just to let you know how it feels. I knew after six years that all the things I thought were going on were. ROBIN GREER: He-- you know, he was a player. And she knew it. I know that's what they fought about mostly. That's why they'd get into their big arguments. And the abuse that would occur as a result of it usually was because she was confronting him about somebody. She told me of numerous instances when they were on the road and OJ would actually fly other women in and put them up in the same hotel  as they were staying at. And then he would say he had a business dinner or something to attend to. And he would sneak off with these other women. And when she questioned him about it, he would beat her. WOMAN (AS NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON): I was so bad because I wore sweats and left shoes around and didn't keep a perfect house or comb my hair the way you liked it? I just don't see how that compares to infidelity, wife beating, verbal abuse. I think you can't quite believe that people you've known your entire life, you know, you're surprised.  And I think you want to believe it's a one-time incident. I guess I thought, wow, if she felt like she was really in trouble, she would tell all of us. And she didn't. They filed two counts of murder on Simpson. Phil and I wanted to go out to Bob Kardashian's house in Encino and say, "Listen, we'd like to pick him up. We don't want a perp walk. We don't want the media. It's going to cause nothing but problems. We'll bring him in through the rear. We'll book him in, and off we go." The brass said no.  No, you're not going to do that. We want him to turn himself in. In other words, for whatever reason, they want a show. ROBERT KARDASHIAN: I just said to OJ, "The police called and you have to turn yourself in today. They're going to charge you with double murder." And he just sat there with this blank look on his face, just pretty much like I can't believe this is happening. Robert had walked into the bedroom. And there OJ was sitting with a gun in his hand wrapped in a towel, ready to shoot himself.  ROBERT KARDASHIAN: He was sitting there with the gun and his pictures of his kids and of Nicole. And then OJ said, "I'm gonna kill myself in this room." And I said, "You can't. This is my daughter's bedroom. I can't have my little girl in this bedroom, and every time I come in there I'm going to see your body laying in this. You can't do that." Robert knelt by the side of the bed, talking OJ out of committing suicide because the cops are coming to arrest him. So OJ goes out the side door of the house.  And Robert follows him. And there he is with the gun again to his head. But he's standing right where all the garbage cans are. And Robert says, "You can't kill yourself there because you want your body to be found in the midst of all this garbage?" ROBERT KARDASHIAN: And we start walking around the house. There's a retaining wall about four feet high. And we sit there talking and looking at angles of the sun. And he says, "Well, maybe I'll just do it here." And I said, "You can't do it there because every time I  sit-in the living room, I'm gonna look out and I'm gonna see you lying there." OJ had said, "This is what I got to do." His whole life was being torn away, destroyed. And then having to go to prison? I don't think he would want to live the rest of his life in prison. GREGORY CASON: He was under incredible stress. His wife had just been killed. He was being fingered in this murder. He already wants everybody to like him. He already wants to be on top and to be the center of attention. So all of a sudden, this is happening  and he's being seen in the most negative light. So you have to think that would do a number on him. LAWRENCE SCHILLER: One day I was at Robert's house. And he says, "You know, I have something that I haven't shared with anybody yet and I think that you should hear it." It turns out to be a tape secretly recorded while waiting for the police to come. And Robert didn't even find it until after the trial. OJ SIMPSON: I don't want anybody to feel sorry for me. I had a great life. I had some great friends.  Nobody should feel sorry for me. I feel sorry for myself that I, despite everything that I had, I let myself get depressed. I let myself get lonely. And I thought there was just so many people out there. Maybe I should open up with people and they would have known more how I was feeling inside. WOMAN (ON RADIO): Suspect wanted for a double 187 in the West LA division. Suspect's name, Orenthal James Simpson. INTERVIEWER: You left the Kardashian residence in Mr. Cowlings' Bronco, correct? Correct.  INTERVIEWER: And did you tell anyone that you were going? No. The Los Angeles Police Department right now is actively searching for Mr. Simpson. INTERVIEWER: You didn't ask Mr. Cowlings to take you to the police station, right? Correct. INTERVIEWER: Whose idea was it to leave? Mine. INTERVIEWER: Why did you leave? Because I wanted to go to Nicole's grave. ROBERT KARDASHIAN: The officer came in. And he just said, "I'm here to get Mr. Simpson." And I walked upstairs and said, "OJ," and I kept calling his name.  And we opened the door and he wasn't in there. And now we start searching the house. I knew what was going on the whole time, whereas nobody else did. Mr. Simpson is a fugitive of justice right now. And if you assist him in any way, you are committing a felony. Robert believed in OJ and he believed in their friendship. And he was doing something that he thought was the right thing to do. ROBERT SHAPIRO: We have the television on. There were now accounts that he had fled. Then Bob says, "I'm going to have a press conference.  We got to go." It was written by OJ today. The next thing I knew, it was Robert Kardashian reading this letter that sounded like a suicide note on national television. I think of my life and feel I've done most of the right things. So why do I end up like this? I can't go on. I had thought he was dead when I read the letter. It was like an out-of-body experience. I just wanted to get through the letter without crying. OJ SIMPSON: I tried so hard to make everybody feel good or see the good side to feel up, but I didn't share my pain.  And I think that's where I made my mistake. Please remember me as The Juice. Please remember me is a good guy. Don't remember me as whatever negative that might end up here. GREGORY CASON: Here he's about to be arrested. And he's completely distraught. And he's talking about himself, The Juice, and how he wants to be portrayed. And he doesn't want to be remembered in a negative way. This is not a man who-- who can be able to put himself aside to consider others. He's too busy thinking about himself.  VOICE (ON RADIO) Simpson is thought to be in the back seat of the white Bronco that you see there on the freeway. The helicopter picked Cowlings' white Bronco up and started to transmit the images. Every single channel across the country was carrying what became the slow Bronco chase. I'm thinking, well, I'm pretty sure this is our suspect. He's trying to get away. But why is he only going 15 miles an hour? And then I hear wait a minute, he's not driving. Cowlings is driving. AL COWLINGS: This is AC.  I have OJ in the car. But you've got to tell the police just to back off. He's still alive, but he's got a gun to his head. TOM LANGE: I said oh, great. What is he going to do with a gun? He's going to shoot himself? Maybe he's going to commit suicide. Well, maybe he's going to shoot AC. All of a sudden, people are running up to the car and beating on it. He's going to shoot one of those idiots. I had no idea at that time what was going on. But it definitely sealed in everyone's mind who was watching, which was millions of people,  that there's a possibility that this guy's going to kill himself. And he probably did it. TOM LANGE: I said, well, I'll try to call him on the phone. No way in hell he's going to pick it up. So I call it. He picks it up the first ring. Just throw the gun out the window. Please, you're scaring everybody. OJ SIMPSON: I can't take this. TOM LANGE: Oh yes, you can. Don't do this. OJ SIMPSON: All I did was love Nicole. That's all I did, was love her. TOM LANGE: I understand. ROSS BECKER: Here's a man who'd been in his public life  forever. His entire persona was what other people thought of him. Why get in a truck and head off somewhere? Where were you and AC going to go? We went to the cemetery. I wanted to see her grave. I had been that week. And I know it's maybe kind of selfish. I was attacked all week. But my mother told me later on they wasn't attacking me. They were attacking this image they had of me. But I couldn't decipher that at the time. REPORTER: It's a shocking sight-- an American icon, OJ Simpson, clearly suicidal, with a gun  to his head on live television. TANYA BROWN: I couldn't wrap my brain around it. This was not a stranger. This is somebody who I've known since I was seven years old, who I used to call Uncle OJ. I mean, it was like my dad considered him like his own son. OJ SIMPSON: I'm the only one that deserves. TOM LANGE: No, you don't deserve that. OJ SIMPSON: [inaudible]. TOM LANGE: You do not deserve to get hurt. I was watching it in my office and I was crying. You know, Nicole had been murdered. I thought maybe OJ was gonna commit suicide.  You know, this was somebody I really, really, really cared about. REX BEABER: People who are innocent have something that stops them from being suicidal. That something that they have is hope. The person most likely to surrender to depression is the person who secretly knows that the truth is not in their favor. OJ SIMPSON: I'm just gonna leave. TOM LANGE: No, don't. OJ SIMPSON: I'm just gonna go with Nicole. That's all I'm gonna do. TOM LANGE: Hey, listen-- OJ SIMPSON: That's all I'm trying to do.  TOM LANGE: --think about everybody else, all right? OJ SIMPSON: I just can't do it here on the freeway. I couldn't do it in a field. I wanted to do it at her grave. I want to do it at my house. TOM LANGE: Is it an admission of guilt? You know, when I talk to him, he's going 15 miles an hour back in the other direction. If he had a real shot at the border, they would have gone to the border. I'm not clear whether he knew exactly what he wanted to do. At the same time, I'm thinking I'm getting gamed here.  This is all a big publicity thing. REPORTER: Any moment now, Simpson should be pulling into his driveway of his Brentwood estate. ROBERT KARDASHIAN: Now there's a lot of plainclothes cops and 10 SWAT guys inside the doorway. And now they're saying he's on his way back. Everybody's got to leave the house. And I said, "I'm not leaving. He's going to want to see me. Make sure I'm standing right where he can see me." REPORTER: Police vehicles, motorcycles, people running in every direction-- it's chaos.  REPORTER: --the crowded doorway of the home is Robert Kardashian, who is a close friend of OJ Simpson. ROBERT KARDASHIAN: We saw somebody run. INTERVIEWER: Did you run to the car? JASON SIMPSON: Yeah. INTERVIEWER: For what reason? JASON SIMPSON: Desperation. ROBERT KARDASHIAN: The cops started yelling, "Get him out of there." And I said, "Wait, that's his son. That's Jason. REPORTER: All right, who is that out there? I tried to reach through AC's window. And AC stopped me and pushed me back. And I had the police behind me yelling and then AC yelling.  And it was-- I just turned around and just said, "Jesus, just get back in the house and let these guys handle it." Don't [inaudible]. ROBERT KARDASHIAN: Jason, come on. JASON SIMPSON: [inaudible]. ROBERT KARDASHIAN: Jason. TOM LANGE: You'd see him pick up the gun with two hands. And he'd open his mouth and he's put the gun to his mouth. AL COWLINGS: Don't-- ROBERT KARDASHIAN: Jason? AL COWLINGS: They got you on tape. Please, listen to me, Listen to me, OJ, listen. OJ, no. No, OJ. OJ Simpson seemed to be a man who was caught  in the cross-hairs of a legal tornado. But he never seemed to me to understand or grasp the horror of what happened to Nicole Brown Simpson or the jeopardy that he was in, facing possibly the death penalty. I can tell you I was at peace. When I was driving down there, I was at total peace. What I had been feeling all week to me was behind me. And I just honestly wanted to be with Nicole. Did you intend to commit suicide? I didn't know what I wanted to do. INTERVIEWER: What did AC-- I wanted it to stop.  I know that. REPORTER: We're hearing over our radio, I believe that OJ Simpson has given himself up. REPORTER: Accused murderer Simpson is coming out. REPORTER: American hero OJ Simpson has surrendered to the police. ROBERT KARDASHIAN: I was standing there. I hugged him. The police grabbed either side of him. I was thrilled that he was alive, but very apprehensive about what he was going to face. REPORTER: Newly released 911 emergency tapes appear to reveal a chilling side of the football hero that will be a shock to his adoring public.  REPORTER: With these new revelations, the carefully cultivated image of OJ Simpson as a positive role model for the youth of America have been shattered. ROSS BECKER: This OJ Simpson case was the perfect case for so many people to jump on, to talk about, to speculate about. And I'm not talking about the general public. I'm talking about the media. REPORTER: It's astonishing how far OJ Simpson's image has fallen, the transformation from revered to reviled. WOMAN (ON PHONE): OJ, I know you did it. 	Liberal			Liberal	76
G222	https://youtu.be/WiS4hhAMtYI?si=FzDIG1QzTyvFY-Ts	came across this clip over the weekend this is from 2018 but I really liked watching this not just because it was actually good journalism that you rarely get to see um but because this is a preview of what we are going to see in 20 years with these pro-israel politicians or anybody that is coming of age in this time and seeking power who wants to get elected office where did you stand on Gaza where did you stand on the genocide of the Palestinian people because there's a lot of revisionist history that happens  but Margaret Thatcher the conservatives Ronald Reagan the conservatives in this country in the 80s were immensely supportive of the apartheid regime in South Africa they accused the ANC of being communists and terrorists as well and uh there were many of the the same tactics of suppression used against college students protesting apartheid at that time so this is an interview in 2018 when Teresa may who at the time you was involved in politics but was not supportive of Nelson Mandela and uh thec  in the efforts to to combat apartheid um going in 2018 to visit Robin Island where he was in prison red to honor him and channel 4's Michael Crick asks her basically how do you have the G visit Robin Ireland you were active in politics in the 70s and 80s what did you do to help release man Nelson Mandela well I think what is important is what the United Kingdom did and no no what did you do what did you do did did you go on protests did you get arrested outside the embassy did you boycott South African Goods did you do anything  I think you know for well that I didn't go on protests Michael but what is important is the work that the United did you boycott Satan Goods the work that the United Kingdom government did to ensure that it was able to give support where that support hang on at that stage Mrs thater Mrs Thatcher believed that Nelson Mandela was a terrorist were you a loyal conservative party member did you think the same thing what was important was the support that the UK government was giving at the time often support behind the scenes um  but in in other ways too we saw to ensure that we saw the results that we did in relation to the ending of apartheid here in South Africa a government led by a woman who thought that Nelson Mandela was a terrorist now you're going to be going to Robin Ireland aren't you going to be feeling guilty that at the time Nelson Mandela was on Robin Ireland you Theresa May did nothing to help his release you personally what I what I will be feeling I think when I go to Robin Island uh is to recognize the immense Stans ship  statesmanship of a man who spent so many years incarcerated statesmanship and when he came out of that incarceration had that he was incar he was incarcerated in part due to the fact that the resistance the western western governments like the UK and the United States um were supportive of the apartheid regime and did not pressure this the white the white apartheid regime to release their biggest political prisoner because that was a threat to their power and I just found that to be a fun clip for how she  squirms but also a basically a window into the future well and the present like there's a reason that South Africa still hasn't got around to the land reforms that were promised in that in those good times in the 9s uh and it's because probably the that's that's actually the role that Britain plays is okay you're going to get rid of a partti let's see how to do this in a way that actually is fine for Capital so that's actually the role that people like that played when they say they played a role because the  real radical role that got that got aparted out of there was played by like uh you know radicals like mandelo or you know I mean we had Ronnie cow was on Communists um uh who helped uh um sabotage efforts and uh sort of resistance armed resistance like the MK uh like which obviously the Britain Britain was not supporting um behind the scenes they were uh yeah exactly so behind the scenes that it was almost IND discernible yeah we have literally call him the guy a terrorist this is like the video equivalent of like when the CIA  tweets like happy Martin Luther King exactly exactly well okay we remember a civil rights hero that we absolutely did not tell to did not tell to commit suicide when he during his time okay and the men not just that he was deemed a terrorist he was deemed a terrorist until 2008 he was on the terrorist watch list Nelson Nelson Mandela and then these Western governments have the G to to Herald uh the figures who actually made the sacrifice as Heroes and pretend we were with them all along this is what  will happen in 20 years but hopefully we'll have a new crop of leaders then that were inv D in boycotting Israel in dismantling this project in standing up for the Palestinian people and they'll be able to answer that question better than Teresa may yeah I mean speaking of books to read um long walk to Freedom by Nelson Mandela is another one that everybody probably should read think the audio book's pretty widely available too but he frankly like talks about um things like armed resistance and  sabotage and even um terrorism and you know obviously he says uh terrorism we decided not to do it obviously for just distasteful reasons of of committing it but also it would have a negative effect but he says that if that the fight got so dire that that was the only thing that they were left to I would just read those chapters and maybe see if there's any other things that applies to in terms of who's responsible for when violence breaks out in a colonial situation for  	Liberal			Center	77

G256	https://youtu.be/DSQZXakfJ6Y?si=zqKq2o18JouqlOYc	Donald Trump is presenting as both visibly agitated and very sleepy and falling asleep inside his criminal trial reporters who are there are talking about how Donald Trump is uh kind of scowling at reporters and pointing at reporters and then at the other hand he'll like fall asleep for a period of time um and this is all while uh David pecker a key witness is on the stand just deliver testimony that is disastrous for Donald Trump and while Trump is scowling at reporters and pointing at reporters and falling asleep  and David pecker is testifying Trump is also sending like bizarre emails I mean it's probably coming from uh his campaign but uh emails like this are being sent over and over again like um I hope this isn't goodbye I'll never forget what you've done for me dot dot dot dot dot dot dot make America and I think it says make America great again but he sends messages like that or messages like this I'm not going to jail I guess that reflects him kind of falling asleep and then being visibly agitated take a look at what Harry  Litman uh reported on and Harry Litman actually got a seat right behind Donald Trump in the courtroom today and Harry Litman says greetings from the courtroom whereby sheer luck of the draw and you know why uh you know Harry litman's part of the mightest touch Network partner with his channel talking feds he goes greetings from the courtroom where by sheer luck of the draw I'm in the front row Trump side so I will have some extra nuances to report and here's what he reported yet again Donald Trump is  falling asleep he's between his two main lawyers uh and Harry Litman said how in other cases even where there were like big shot criminal defendants the lawyers would Rouse their clients not here a distinctive feature of this trial among other trials of the century and big trials I've seen or been involved with is lawyers essential fear of their client in other words as Donald Trump is just falling asleep Trump's lawyers are too afraid to like wake him up and make him pay attention and look let's give  you multiple data points it's not just Harry Litman saying that um you also have Jillian Frankle in the courtroom saying Trump is sitting in the courtroom with his eyes shut leaning back comfortably there are three Secret Service agents seated behind him in the front row of the gallery and here's what Norm eizen uh who's actually involved in the first Trump impeachment he was in the court today Norm Isen said Trump just pointed at me and scow as he left the courtroom I guess he's not a fan and so that's what Donald Trump is doing as  well also you have Olivia newsy she previously reported a few days back Trump is tilting his head dramatically and making trout likee movements with his mouth as he listens to Justice meran I also have another source who's inside the courtroom who ask that I not name them specifically um but this Source had a very interesting take of what was uh going on in the courtroom and it confirmed all of the other uh reporting that uh I've just read for you let me uh take a look and just so I I want to make  sure I get this absolutely uh 100% uh accurate right here as to um what was uh going on in the courtroom they said that Trump looked to actually be in close to deep REM sleep um that his Lids are heavy um often times look like he's about to fall asleep but then he's taking fullon Bonafide nap possibly REM sleep taking place um and you know I have not heard anything yet today about any other kind of things going on there but then Donald Trump leaves the courtroom after scowling out reporters after falling asleep after  being visibly agitated and then he complains about the temperature in the courtroom here he is saying how cold he is play this clip and it's a shame it's a shame and I'm sitting here for days now from morning to till night in that freezing room freezing everybody was freezing in there and all for this and this is your result look at that each one of them is story and it's very unfair very bad thing very bad thing the whole world is watching this HX let's be real most guys

other day as well complaining about how cold he is here  play this other clip so we have another day of court in a freezing Courthouse it's very cold in there for on purpose I believe they don't seem to be able to get the temperature up it shouldn't be that complicated but we have a freezing cour has and that's fine that's just fine let them keep handing it out Mr a rick TR thank you very much to jail Mr to make you uncomfortable birthday just just wait here's Trump's lawyer Alina habba basically predicting that she thinks that Donald Trump is going to uh lose uh  the case play I mean as As Trump falls asleep there play this clip about everything exactly how I felt that day I think until it's over and behind us um but I don't have hopes really that high at this moment that the New York courts will do the right thing that the jury will do the right thing we're in a blue State as you know Greg and and of course we've been reporting on the testimony by David pecker who in the teeker and the uh and the pecker testimonies been very bad for Donald Trump so far Pecker's  presented as being very credible he was close with Donald Trump he talked about um the foundation of of how he took over the national inquire how he ran a company called Ami pecker talked about the deal he made with Donald Trump to publish fake news stories about Donald Trump's political opponents how that deal evolved uh ultimately to find to basically serve as a private investigator for the Trump campaign to find bad stories um that could come out about Donald Trump and buy the rights to those stories so a doorman they  purchased the rights to those stories of a Trump Tower doorman killed that story killed a story about Trump having an affair with Karen McDougall um for a year while Melania was pregnant and Melania had given birth you know and ultimately Ami and uh and pecker they they stopped they they they started feeling very uncomfortable about violating the law and this relationship so they wouldn't do the Stormy Daniels transaction of buying the story of Stormy Daniels uh affair with Donald Trump or having sex with Donald Trump um  and so Trump was cheating on Karen McDougall who he was cheating on Melania with with the porn star stormmy Daniels and ultimately uh that payment was done through Michael Cohen Cohen hasn't testified yet but pcker talked about how Donald Trump very specifically thanked him for the McDougall situation for handling it pcker made it clear he was doing it for the benefit of the Trump campaign that he was trying to help the Trump campaign um that Trump had White House officials like Sarah Huckabee Sanders and hope Hicks who were involved  in this as well and all the while Trump is either looking like a trout as Olivia newsy described it Trump is falling asleep and as a source says like almost like a deep REM sleep like a fullon nap um or he's waking up and like scowling at reporters um I just wonder what the jury is thinking of of of of of this all and then Donald Trump's posting those things this may be my goodbye I may never see you again I mean it's just so weird and so pathetic but tell me what you you think um that's the update right  now from the courtroom keep me I'll keep you posted keep checking in on the midest touch Network in a little bit I'll be doing a live with Karen Freedman egn thanks for watching and have a good

G262	https://youtu.be/D-ftk1KQsnE?si=H4_XOnnTNlCYbfyA	[Music] you want me to put that on my [Music] touger this one's wife why are they hiding the kids Archie and lird are four and 2 and a half they achieve prince and princess status they are the children of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex and yet they are rarely seen there are occasional photographs which are released little bits of footage that have appeared in their flick documentary but the actual instances were the children are seen in public the children are seen with their parents is extremely limited and this of course  prompts the question why is this in order to understand why we see so little of the children it of course is useful to do so by understanding who is it who has control of them naturally the parents now we know that there are nannies that are involved but ultimate control vests with this one's wife and Harry and therefore in the circumstances when you understand the classification of the parents that brings insight as to why the children are treated in the way that they are Harry has to go along with what this  one's wife his Handler Estates if he doesn't he finds himself devalued The Old Pink pods get tasered he's banished to the chicken Coupe but the fact is no matter to what extent he wants to parent in a particular way his views are regulated to those of his wife because she's in charge since she is a narcissist she must have that control and therefore ultimately the parenting of the children is governed by the narcissism of this one's wife both in terms of not allowing Harry to take certain steps with regard to the  children not allowing the nannies to behave in a particular way to them and ultimately her own interactions with them and that has to be borne in mind in relation to why it is that the children are barely seen of course there is the obvious contradiction that exists this one's wife regularly talks about how she loves being a mother that being a mother is the most important thing in her life and yet she never actually talks particularly much about how she parents the children there was a silence as to  the birth itself she doesn't talk about many things that they do and she utilizes them as a narcissist would do as props to try and angulate the broader public magazines news outlets for the purposes of controlling them drawing fuel from them and managing that facade of being such a good mother and yet she brings the children to play on a regular basis by talking about them in terms of how wonderful it is being a mother to them but yet then never shows them they never make much of an appearance and of course in a sense  that's entirely typical of the narcissist as I've explained to you on many occasions if the narcissist can get to the prime aims by just talking about them rather than doing them then that's all you'll get from The Narcissist thus the narcissist might say to you I can't wait to marry you but then you never get married to the narcissist why the narcissist was able to control you with the promise of marriage you gave fuel in reaction to that you provided residual benefits as a consequence of believing  you were going to get married therefore there's no need for the narcist to actually marry you oh I can't wait to take you on holiday we're going to go to maius you react enthusiastically to that suggestion thus that puts you under control you're giving fuel you might Dole out a bit of the old house your father as a consequence of that providing a residual benefit and yet no holiday to Marius ever ever manifests why because the narcissist has been able to achieve the prime aims through t rather than doing the walk and  it's similar with this one's wife if she can gain that control and fuel by talking about the children and talking about what a fantastic mother she is she gets that control she gets that fuel she manages the facade and then she doesn't actually have to do anything by way of showing you the interactions with the children or showing the children but there are a variety of reasons which may unlock why it is that the children aren't seen first is as I've just explained it's easier just to talk rather than show and and interact  but let us consider further reasons the most obvious one is the children simply do not exist and therefore if they children don't exist then you're not going to be able to show them off repeatedly you can talk about them but not show them and there are those that believe that child actors have been used rather than there being actual children I've explained elsewhere that whilst the scenario does seem somewhat unlikely it is a possibility for a narcissist to behave that way and although it's probably one of  the more unusual reasons for the failure to see the children it's a possibility albeit a slim one another reason is that it's quite simply easier to go to various places without them because then Harry and this one's wife can do what they want those of you who are parents listening will remember those occasions where you might have been able to get a relative to look after your children for a night or possibly a weekend and that sense of Liberation that you experienced as a consequence of being apart from  your cherished crotch goblins you are able to not back a few drinks and not worry about being compass mous look after the children children you could lie in the next day without somebody jumping up and down on the bed and yet those instances of course a few and far between because as a parent you discharged your obligations as a parent whereas with Harry and this one's wife it's different all of you recognized that you had an obligation as a parent and that you couldn't keep fting your children  off on other people you couldn't necessarily afford to have nanni always looking after them and you actually wanted to be with your children notwithstanding the fact that as I've heard from many people it's very difficult being a parent at times however for the sussexes Harry has been brought up with a situation where he was regularly looked after by nannies and therefore it's entirely natural for him to have such an arrangement and therefore for him to have the Children looked after by nannies Is Not Unusual  in the slightest therefore it's natural to him for this one's wife there is no maternal Bond she has no emotional empathy for the children and she's lazy accordingly if there's a choice between having to pack bags with all the various utams that are required for a child to then take them to say New York even if a nanny comes along as well it's too much like hard work it limits her and therefore that limiting effect upon her is a threat to control so her narcissism rejects it where there's an instance of being able to do something  driven by her sense of entitlement that comes up against the question of accountability you have two children you need to look after and therefore that means you're not going to be able to do all of the things that you would want to do the narcism basically says get rid of them thus leave them at home have the nannies look after them going down to the farmers's market what child wouldn't fancy a little stroll with their parents and lots of things to see no because that would then mean having to bow to  the needs of the child pausing if they want to look at something not being able to talk as long as you would want with somebody because the child's going Mommy Mommy Mommy tugging on your skirt or your trousers and thus her narcissism guides her to reject those constraints upon her sense of entitlement by essentially saying to her when you do things do them without the children accordingly one of the reasons is it's simply easier to go places without them so she can do what she wants the next reason is kind of linked  to the reason that I've just explained to you but centers around the issue of the facade as a middle mid-range narcissist this one's wife operates a facade of a supposedly good mother fishon icon kind person empathic fun relatable children have Tantrums children get their sticky fingers on things children children break things children touch things children run in a direction towards traffic so you're forced to run after them and stop them I've seen this with my nieces and nephews and I've seen the way that my  siblings have had to deal with those children now ordinarily that's not such an issue because they recognize it as part of parenting but also they know how to discipline the children they are able to utilize that look or voice that would cause the child to behave themselves the problem that this one's wife has is that because of her sense of entitlement she spent such little time with them that she doesn't actually know how to parent first of all she has no emotional empathy for them but of course  she could learn the parenting skills as many narcissists do as a consequence of mimickry but she hasn't got that because she doesn't spend much time with them and furthermore and this is hugely important the children probably wouldn't accept being disciplined by her because they simply don't spend enough time with her aren't she's more likely to be disciplined by a pair of trees than he is by this one's wife it's the naners that deal with all of that so the problem that this one's wife has is it  were she out in public with the children and they started to play up as children invariably do witness loose canon Louie and his behavior but he responds to stern words from Katherine because she regularly has to discipline him whereas with Archie and libert if they started to play up in public this one's wife not only wouldn't necessarily know how to respond but if she did attempt to discipline them it's likely that they wouldn't respond to it and thus they would continue to pose a threat to her  control and the problem that she then has is this her facade is likely to crack because she would respond by flipping out in public striking the child screaming at them having a strop herself and that all important and precious facade would fracture accordingly the narcism recognizes that the risk that is posed by having to deal with the children and therefore suggests leave them at home to avoid that damage occurring she simply wouldn't be able to handle them in public the facade would be damaged and  therefore the narcisism needs to protect that another possible reason again linked to her narcissism why the children are not seen is they simply don't meet with her expectations as a narcissist she believes that her children are beautiful perfect talented that they rainbows come out of their mouths when they speak that they're the first to do anything in terms of their progress learning to talk learning to walk all of those things all of those milestones and the fact is she expects Perfection because remember they are  little mirrors there are little chunks of her that she utilizes as extensions of herself to seek the prime aim subconsciously elsewhere and if the children do not meet her expectations with regard to how they Lear with regard to how they behave with regard to their intelligence with regard to their progress the fact is she doesn't want the world to see that because it reflects badly on her think about it if the children were Little Cuties in the way that the wales's children are if they were particularly talented a  narcissist could not resist the urge to show them off why because those childrens are those children are an extension of the narcissist and therefore the narcissist draws fuel from people responding gosh your children are gorgeous oh thank you very much but that other Appliance demonstrates their in control with such a comment and provides fuel the fact is where a narcissist believes that their children are Little Cuties that they're particularly talented that they're adorable in their little ways and behaviors they will use  any opportunity to show them off because it enables them to get to the prime aims using their children and therefore it's a possibility that for whatever reason the children do not meet her expectation it might be luxs it might be Behavior it might be Talent whatever it is but because they don't meet the expectations that she has therefore they're kept away because quite frankly they would then reflect badly upon on her remember she has no emotional empathy for them so irrespective of what little imperfections that they may have  and of course as I understand all parents regard their children as fantastic in what one way or another because they're their children but she would not as a narcissist and if they were so beautiful so cute so special Etc she would regularly be parading them in order to use them to get to those Prime aims and the fact that she does not suggests that they're perhaps not meeting her expectations in some way linked to that a further reason why we might not see the children is quite simply they're too white and this goes  against her person of color narrative that she utilizes and of course the claims of being 43% Nigerian that this would cause an inherent contradiction I would see this as less likely simply because that the narrative that she uses as a person of color she can drop the very next day where she needs to be white so similarly with the children just because they may look very white which goes against her personal narrative her compartmentalization would necessarily deal with that appropriately and therefore whilst it is  a possibility I see that as being somewhat unlikely of course this go link into the suggestion that the children were born through a surrogate as well which might be the case that there is an issue with regard to how they look because of that surrogacy but as I State I think ultimately a compartmentalization with jettison that particular point the next suggestion and this is something that was offered by a contributor on the St this one's wife subred they use her full name as you know I do not where one contributor  suggested that the reason you can't see the children is that they can't get the same child actors because there's an ongoing actor strike this links back to the fact that they don't actually exist and the child actors are hired when they are occasionally seen and the fact is that because there is a strike and they can't get the same child actors this presents them with a problem is this likely well this all depends on whether you believe the children exist or not again that is a scenario which seems less likely albeit  cannot be completely ruled out because a narcissist could well be engage in such deceit another reason as to why you don't see the children could be because you basically only get to see them if you pay and nobody is paying remember these children are there as an extension of what this one's wife requires and money is hugely important to her as a residual benefit and therefore in the circumstances she would merchandise the children as much as she could and it may just be the case that nobody's getting  the checkbook out and therefore that's why the children are kept away from public view finally again linked to her narcissism another reason why she may not allow the children to be seen is quite simply she does not want to share the spotlight with them she is a narcissist which means she has to be front and center in order to control people and draw in the fuel she needs to be the one that is seen and if she's there with children and because they're not seen very often the spotlight would shift onto them and away from her of  course you may well think gosh isn't it awful to be so envious of your children but that's what narcissists are like they cannot stand for other people to be the center of attention in the spotlight because that means the fuel is going to them they proba they won't need it they're not narcissists but it doesn't matter because in the world of the narcissist the fact that detention is going elsewhere wounds that narcissist and starves them with fuel and thus her narcism would direct her not to involve  the children to ensure that she is the main character that she is in the spotlight that she is able to control and draw fuel accordingly there are a number of cogent reasons some more likely than others but all linked to her narcissism because as I explained at the outset if you start to understand what a person is and it's ascertained that they are a narcissist that equips you with a special set of knowledge to then understand why they behave as they do many people as I repeatedly tell you struggle to understand why Harry's wife  behaves as she does but this one's wife behaves in the way that she does as a consequence of her narcissism it governs all of her behavior when it comes to interacting with other people which of those reasons do you think are applicable to the fact that we do not see the children is it one in particular or do you see that a number of factors that I've mentioned there apply to why the children are not seen let me

G263	https://youtu.be/eftb29d_sew?feature=shared	hello everyone from time to time I write something when there's something particularly complex happening and I have to get my thoughts and close formal order and so I did that this week I wrote an article for the telegraph I'm going to read it here it's called I'm pr- Muslim but anti- Thug over the past few years I've engaged in a continual dialogue with people across the spectrum of Islam from aan hery Ali who left her religious upbringing behind through moderates such as Mustafa akul and Hamza yussef and  with foray into the more conservative side with Muhammad hijab for example a rather temperamental young Muslim not without his influence in the UK I have done this because I believe that Jews Christians and Muslims share more in common than in division and because I know that since there is no such thing as a world without religion we all must do what is best with what we have been bequeathed I find myself in some arguably serious online trouble this week nonetheless although I realize I'm far from alone in this because I  indicated my desire that the authorities in Israel give the terrorists who invaded their land and tortured and killed their citizens the hell that they most truly deserve how could I say such a thing while simultaneously m maining my desire for rosma between the peoples of the abrahamic tradition let us begin that discussion by rendering unto Caesar what is Caesar's and unto God what is Gods the attack on Israel last week by the monsters of Hamas occurred as far as I am concerned not because Muslims and  Jews must by religious necessity be at each other's throats but because Iran a country run by Thugs and deem so even by its own people has become very concerned that the rulers of Saudi Arabia will continue in their laudable attempts to formulate a productive peace with Israel four Arab countries recently signed the Abraham Accords a trump era initiative that should have garnered that exident for all his manifold faults a Nobel Peace Prize at least in a world where the of Barack Obama were deemed worthy of such  an honor behind the Arab signatories who were essentially the United Arab Emirates Bahrain Morocco and Sudan stood the Saudis without whose tacd agreement no such steps would have been taken and everyone knew it Joe Biden and the Democrats had a historic and unparalleled opportunity to bring the Saudis into the fold soon after they took power from Trump instead demonstrating an almost miraculous shortsightedness they alienated that sometimes Troublesome Middle Eastern power almost immediately after adopting  office choosing instead of Peace the opportunity to deny to the previous president of the United States any of the honor he most truly deserved for his revolutionary breakthrough one that had been deemed utterly impossible by the blinkered fools who ruled the state department for decades to say it again the Saudis would have come aboard the great ship of the Abraham Accords two years ago had Biden seized the opportunity instead he and his fellow Democrats downplayed the significance of the Trump  administration's Cardinal achievement just to score the cheapest and most expensive of political points and here we are again in consequence drowning in the blood of many Israeli and Palestinian alike despite being snubbed in a truly provocative Manner and their consequent and Justified anger remember the Saudi unwillingness to provide the US with additional oil when Biden asked remember their recent flirtation with China the Saudi leaders have been strongly considering the continuation and extension of the Abra peace  process in Consequence the totalitarian mulas of Iran have been driven to desperation knowing full well that such an agreement would undermine and isolate them fatally this is the same Iran by the way that the Democrats under Biden have utterly failed to resist and control continuing a pattern wellestablished by the aforementioned Nobel Laureate Obama and what have Iran is it a shining star in the Islamic firmament or is it a country Hagrid by a pathologically self-serving criminal kleptocracy religious in name  only let's turn to psychology for a moment to answer that question there is a form of Psychopathology well detailed in recent years the veritable place where psychological instability Meets Evil itself the personality features that are part and parcel of that danger to integrated psyche and state alike first acquired the nomenclature of dark Triad a combination of melanism instrumental manipulativeness and deceit narcissism inflated false self-esteem and desire for unearned attention and status and psychopathy a malignant  mixture of criminal propensity callousness and parasitism the dark Triad traits were identified and measured by intellectual descendants of the Canadian Dr Robert hair who spent his life assessing and endeavoring to understand the worst of the habitual criminals responsible not only for the most barbaric and cruel of misdemeanors but also for the vast majority of criminal acts the famous Paro principle of unequal distribution of talent and acquisition applies to the underworld as well just as one 1% of the world's  inhabitants hold something approximating 70% of the wealth so 1% of the criminals commit 70% of the crimes but all that's not bad enough bad as it is more recent investigators of the structure of the darkest of temperamental propensities found it necessary to add an extra Dimension to the measurement Matrix sadism positive Delight in the suffering of others the more unnecessary and gratuitous the better so now we have the dark tetrad dark tetrad types fit well into what is known as cluster B of the  personality disorders which also includes such Delights as antisocial personality disorder borderline personality disorder the female equivalent of the criminal tendency hisonic personal disorder also mostly female and narcissistic personality disorder those who manifest cluster b symptomatology or sins have in addition to their other psychologically and socially dangerous Tendencies the proclivity to claim positive virtue or outright victim status while pursuing their utterly self-serving grandiose and  destructive claims the cluster beat types lie cheat steal gossip reputation Savage brag claim credit where none is due and distribute blame to everyone but themselves all the while pursuing nothing but their own immediate immature hedonistic self-gratification all the while trumpeting their moral virtue and or brandishing their identity as unfairly oppressed Innocents when they organize and this happens from time to time they threaten the Integrity of the entire Society within which they operate  hoping to light everything of flame and dance orgiastic in the runes this happened after the French Revolution it happened in Soviet Russia it happened in Nazi Germany it's happening now in the west with the rise of the woke it's something markedly facilitated by the power accessibility and irresponsibility of social media which allows for cluster B misbehavior to propagate with none of the usual real world consequences and we haven't plunged far enough into the abyss yet think for a moment use your imagination for evil if  you dare if you were hellbent on doing nothing but maximizing your own resentful narrowly self- serving juvenile pleasure hoping as well to do maximal harm along the way to anyone skilled and conscientious enough to have deserved a just reward in what guise would you cloak yourself if you were the least bit treacherously wise you would adopt a religious cover how better to camouflage yourself than in the Robes of all that is traditional just merciful and ethical that is less effective in the West Post death of God in consequence of  the collapse of religious Authority so here the dark tetrad types portray themselves as the very avatars of compassion we're for the downtrodden because we can then in good conscience punish the deservedly successful we're for diversity because an ethical Unity stands against our depredations wherefor inclusivity because our fetishes and kings demand their full expression and to hell with everyone else we're for Equity because Merit is our sworn enemy ask yourself this too how else are you to explain the staggeringly  incomprehensible spectacle of for example queers for Palestine perhaps the most egregious example of the Union of the desire by progressives to tear down everything in the west that is worthy even at the cost of formulating an alliance that would in an instant be suicidal if it ever made itself manifest and for those Muslims thinking that it's the evil Jews trademark registered is Iran your idea of a worthy Islamic State the very Iran whose citizens Muslims all have been on the brink of Revolution against their  Psychopathic Masters for more than a year and dreaming about it for much longer than that the very whose hypothetically religious leaders have to oppress their own women because that's the only way they can control those upid sufficiently to have a go at them the Iran who has in recent weeks decided to Rattle the chains of their Hamas dogs stating in the background explicitly or implicitly unleash the crest of your minions send them to Israel to do their worst the Jews will respond as they must  turn the opinion of the Arab world against the Hebrews before we lose our grip and if that means that the Palestinians unite everyone reasonable in the world against them at their great cost so be it and has that not happened Muslims ask yourself this who in the west has Allied themselves with the hypothetical cause of the oppressed Palestinians in the days since the Hamas invasion University students demented by the same idiot left radical professors who have destroyed Academia the former president of Harvard University itself  Lawrence Summers said as much last week who else marxists whose hatred for Islam exceeds anything that the most committed peral fundamentalist Christian or Jew might muster remind me once more what is it that the opiate of the masses Muslims what is regarded as the essential and absolute enemy of the Communist Utopia nothing but the very religious practice you share with your abrahamic brothers who else bringing up the rear the increasingly delusional alphabet Brigade The LGBT 2s SL L QQ Etc Community foolish and blind enough to  assume that commonality of hypothetic oppression is enough to unite it somehow with the mulas of Tran and the gangsters of Hamas dark tetrad types all who would have their blue and pink heads on a Pike in the street in a moment if they were only granted the opportunity useful idiots this is useful idiocy on a scale undreamed of by the most extreme of leninists and maoists alike and what if Israel as an oppressor State well the Palestinians who live in Israel proper are certainly a lot better off by any  standard than the Palestinians who live in Gaza despite the fortune that has been sent to that blighted area all of which for all intents and purposes has been funneled into the secret and not so secret bank accounts of the dark tetrad religious leaders who parade their lying virtues so successfully it was CBC News itself that announced in 2003 that Yasser Arafat had squirrel away $1 billion in his hidden portfolios anyone who doesn't think the same thing is happening now and that goes for Ukraine too folks is a fool  whose blindness is leading them into the proverbial pit tell me this honestly angry Muslims desirous of genuinely practicing your faith do you really think you have anything in common with those who have aligned themselves with you in the West in the past week are those the Brave and forthright comrades in arm whose support LEDs Credence to the Eternal and endlessly manipulable Muslim against Jew story and tell me again how that Alliance is better for your faith and your people than recognition of your  abrahamic commonality with the Christians and present day descendants of the ancient Hebrews and tell me too how the decentralized structure of your religion admirable in so many regards protects it against capture under situations of duress by the bloody Psychopaths who make a faith nothing but a front for criminal evil I'm not saying we're any better in the west our susceptibility to the blandishments of the postmodern Marxist dark tetrad mob is a weakness of equivalent danger but it's your people taking Central stage  right now and your people who have to make a wise decision or else and it's a big or else the Saudis and the other SES of the Abraham Accords have a stark choice in front of them as do the distributed in various people of the Islamic World they and you can allow the thugs particularly those in Iran and Palestine to Triumph in their propagandistic efforts to prop up their own dismal miserable and tyrannical States they and you can in consequence battle the new peace treaty signed with Israel forego all the  obvious benefits for the Muslim World offered by that agreement and to acques to continued rule by the crest of Hypocrites misusing faith in the worst possible of ways what is the famed second commandment of Moses do not use God's name in vain what does that mean it does not mean do not swear or if it does that is its most trivial warning it means much more fundamentally do not attribute to yourself the virtue of the Divine when acting on your own behalf let alone when acting in the thrall of the forces of  Darkness themselves this sentiment is reinforced at least three times by Christ himself in the gospels first when he says and when thou prayest Thou shalt not be as the Hypocrites are for they love to pray standing in the C ogu and in the corners of the streets that they may be seen of men second pointing to the moral hazard in doing good works other than privately but when thou doest alms let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth and third when he says not everyone that saith unto me Lord Lord shall enter into  the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of My Father which is in heaven once again again the mere claim that it is religious conviction that motivates personal action is no proof whatsoever that such is the case it is very difficult to aim upward in Alliance with the spirit that wishes everything well and in keeping with the truth it is a path rif with moral hazard and the public display of virtue including the adoption of high church or mosque or synagogue position is not any guarantee that the god claimed to be  present is in fact there quite the contrary all too often the Saudis and you in the Muslim World more generally could instead remove the beam from your eyes as we should equally in the west see what is so starkly manifesting itself in the world turn away from the terrible tempting path of righteous destruction continue the work already begun in uniting the people of the book and thereby bring a productive generous wise and Lasting peace to this bited but still not yet doomed and even potentially wonderful green and blue orb  we need a transcendental access to revolve around to move us Beyond a blinkered materialism to protect us against a foolish populism and to lift up our eyes to the Eternal Heaven beckoning above us in the west we have that for all the faults of the followers of the Creeds and even with the Creed themselves as currently understood in the form of Islam Christianity and Judaism we need our abrahamic faith lest the hedonistic pagans and worse Prevail and we need to stand United behind it and that is why I'm pr- Muslim but anti  Thug and if you are a true follower of Ella that is the decision that is incumbent upon you in equal measure and that goes as well for the Christians and the Jews 	Leaning

I8	https://youtu.be/SjWBjjuKFo8?si=Dav36SAzMOaWGR50	another pandemic really let's talk about it welcome to prepper Nation I am John you probably already knew that but just in case you didn't I am John thank you very much for being here you newbies and you Usual Suspects I appreciate it if you don't mind shoot a thumbs up maybe hit subscribe if you're new to the channel so we got to talk about this new flu this new pandemic I believe I think that they are laying the groundwork for another c19 type of event y'all let me know what you think in the comments but uh I don't know I I've just  I got a Vibe I've been seeing this a lot popping up in mainstream media it's down near the bottom in all of the mainstream media but it's it's consistently there it almost feels like you know the subliminal programming how it's there and you're not really paying attention to it but they're kind of getting people used to the idea or to the concept okay and some of us have believed I'm not going to lie some of us have believed for a while that we haven't seen the end of the medical tyranny would be the way  to put it so there was an article that hit mainstream media a couple of days back now I saw it it was on Fox Business or something like that but it was on other it was like on Sky BBC all the Legacy Media CNN bird the bird flu pandemic is that in the future you know that was the headline and the EU the European Union is now warning of potential Mass spread of the bird flu uh they they cite this because of the lack of the immunity that that humans have this is typically not something that humans you know it's pretty rare usually  and so we don't have immunity for this stuff and and they're beginning to see cases popping up here cases popping up here and it's transferring really quickly and here lies the problem at least for me again y'all let me know what you think but here's the problem for me the timing of all of this all right so normally when I hear about the bird flu or something like that it's kind of I'm not look I'm being honest with y'all it's kind of like okay here we go again we've heard about this for a hund you  know the hundredth time this year already but again the timing occasionally you you know you might see it on a friend's website or you may see it in mainstream media on one of the websites at the very bottom but again this is a across all of the Legacy Media it's starting to work its way up it's not a top story yet but it's starting little by little to work its way up and again the timing with the election and I mean let's take a look at where we're at with the election here in the United States assuming we have an election in  November big assumption on my part right so we have a rematch between Joe Biden President Joe Biden president Donald Trump and and I get that we have Trump fans out there we may be we may I don't know this is hard to Fathom we may have Biden fans listening to this right now but by and large this is a matchup that nobody really wants nobody really wants these two candidates running head to head head to-head again it's very unpopular when it comes to the average American you know everybody has their reasons I guess  but but let's take a look at where we're at with this election Democrats tried to put Trump in jail and I think they really believe they were going to be able to incarcerate the man and ruin his chances of running you know for office that didn't work and then they tried to disqualify Donald Trump from being on the ballots and even being electable at this point that didn't work you know that was overturned uh in the highest court of the land then they tried to bankrupt this man to where he would lose  his properties he would not have money uh essentially to run for the United States uh office without taking in a lot of outside donor money that didn't work and so now and Backwoods and I were talking about this uh you know on the radioactive podcast this week how a lot of seats are becoming vacant all of the sudden in Congress and it almost feels like somebody had even said in chat it you know people are taking money and bowing out so these seats can be filled by somebody else the swamp is loading for a  fight if you will that or they're reloading I guess you could say it almost feels like this firewall is being put up because I think for the first time since Joe Biden uh you know was sworn in as thief thief and chief let's be honest here right for the first time since then I believe the swamp and and you know the the world Elites if you will your weers they finally they understand okay Trump may become president of the United States again uh what are we going to do about it we they're they're putting a firewall in  place they're trying to minimize I think what Trump can do once he gets into office should that be the case then you factor in Kennedy Jr who is becoming Believe It or Not folks he's becoming very popular with the younger folks who don't like the Biden versus Trump rematch a lot of the younger folks and he's pulling a lot of votes from Biden from uh the Joe Biden campaign and this course plays into Trump no I don't I don't think Kennedy Jr is going to win but I think he may actually win this election for Donald Trump you know he's  he's a major player in this election like it or not and I think that uh he's going to pull so many votes that they can't sweep things under rugs and they can't turn the lights out for five minutes and move the furniture around if you know what I'm saying so with all of this replacement going on I just it feels like the firewall is being put into place it feels like you know the swamp here in the United States but also your globalist Elites like your weers and your EU it feels like in NATO that they  understand okay we may have Donald Trump again and that's very unpopular for these groups because he's not on board at least that's my personal opinion he's not on board with a lot of things that are taking place um and look a trump presidency like him or not could help the economy as the average American sees it now I'm not on Wall Street I don't know how it's going to affect Wall Street or big Corporate America I'm talking about from The View point of an average American who is paying bills month-to month paying you know property  taxes buying gasoline buying groceries having to pay for insurance he's a better candidate like he could improve the economy unless we see a pandemic right the the economy was humming along last time and we saw a pandemic emerge and the timing was strange now you know I don't want to be a conspiracy theorist God forbid right but the timing was was strange because it also fell in an election year and it just feels like the c19 came around came along at just the right time to begin to crash our economy  you know and we went from this absolute uh you know it wasn't perfect but it was a great economy it feels like a great econ economy compared to 2024 at least maybe I'm wrong maybe I misremember but it just feels like things were more affordable and people had money to spend election year pandemic all of the sudden that's no longer the case and it just feels like Trump is on his way back into the white house uh you know all the major polls have the man winning uh you know even the left leaning poles again  Kendy plays into this and it just feels like they're setting up the framework to me for another pandemic so this is the h5n1 and the uh the EU is saying that large scale transmission human to human is possible with this thing this is the big fear and so they've got a couple of things that they want to implement pay attention to this folks they want to implement these two things just to be on the safe side just to avoid another pandemic the first is increased tracking and surveillance on people who may be at  risk do y'all remember back the C9 when they when they put the tracking software on your phones I don't know how many people downloaded it I didn't but the people that had the software it was supposed to tell you okay is there anybody in this store that recently got diagnosed or was exposed to the c19 I'm not a fan of tracking and surveillance in general uh pandemic or otherwise but they want to increase this they want to begin to implement this on people and I think if they do this it's going to start in  Europe but it it will quickly spread and you'll see people here in the United States before long calling for this the second is of course uh a variety of whiskey shots that would help somehow in fantasy land it's going to help the human body resist uh you know the h 5 in1 we have no actual resistance so I don't know how injecting something is going to help your help better resistance that doesn't exist but they don't go on to explain that they don't need to because people believe propaganda right they also call for uh  this is the EU the potential cooling of poultry and fur animal farming so they don't go on record and say how many they would call don't you know would it be a 10,000 chickens would it be 10 million we're talking about how you know how much tracking would be implemented stuff like this and they want a farming database uh even for you even for you if you're a homestad and you have you know you got 20 chickens outside they want to know about if you have other animals they want to know about it again I'm not a  fan of tracking in the first place and surveillance especially by globalist groups uh bad enough when the go when your own government does it but globalist groups you know I'm out on that one um they do say that this is typically rare all right it's rare for a human to catch this virus uh because again we're not exposed to it very often but it's starting to pop up and it does have a 60% fatality rate which just means in layman's terms if 10 human beings catch this six of them are goners six out of  10 uh that's a scary number but I believe it's intended to be a scary number if you know what I mean um do you remember how I've asked in the past on this channel we'd be talking about the c19 and I've asked this question before what would you have done differently how would you have prepped differently nobody prepped perfectly for the c19 because it I guess you know maybe maybe you were here for the Spanish PLU I don't know but for a large majority of us we weren't here for the Spanish flu so it was our first real pandemic you  know what I mean and everybody uh prepped a little bit differently and of course mistakes were made mistakes were made on my part how would you do it differently if you had a redo I think you might get a chance to have a redo unfortunately because I do see them pushing this especially if Trump gets Far and Away right now he's leading by a few you know percentage points here a few here but he is gaining ground and as he gains more ground I mean this may be the card that they play they I'm sure they have several cards up  their sleeves that they can play you know who knows maybe they'll try and cancel it out right they've tried to I believe and we'll talk about it on the next video to trigger World War III they've tried all kinds of things but this could be a card that they could you know play once again because people are already used to it they're already used to the idea of mandates they're already used to the idea of lockdowns and things I'm not talking about you I'm saying the average Jabron out here they're used to  being told you can't go outside they're used to being told you know close your windows open your windows at Thanksgiving don't go to church this sort of thing and there was a lot of compliance last time this could be meant to scare people away from the polls hey let's have an election but let's make it during a pandemic maybe we can just do mail-in ballots or online voting maybe they introduce this I don't know I'm spitballing here but again the timing just seems political to me is the point I'm trying to make uh because like Trump  dislike Trump do whatever you want to do but if Trump becomes president of the United States he's already said a few things that he plans to do day one he's going to free the j6 prisoners he said that is his priority the minute he walks into the White House there's a danger in that from the left because if these people are freed right and I agree they should not they shouldn't be locked up maybe a maybe a few of them the ones that that were climbing the side of the buildings and kicking doors in right  even though it's the people's house they were they were breaking the law to a degree but I'm talking about the people that were just outside protesting okay j6 is a sensitive topic because people were we always talk about people don't do anything people don't stand up and and often times people will say look what happened to the J Sixers you know they're political prisoners and now everybody's afraid to do anything if he goes in and he frees these individuals people might have the guts to start standing up so this is  dangerous uh you know for the people that uh don't like Freedom would be the way to put it uh again Trump would be great for a failing economy you have to crash the economy before you install something else if he gets in and he somehow revitalizes the economy again for the average American right then they can't crash it the control demolition doesn't work the war in Ukraine think he would immediately have the United States pulled completely out of it NATO or not he doesn't care uh you know it is what it is I think he's  going to pull us out of these wars that we don't need to be tied up into and I and there's a lot of money going over there okay so this is dangerous for these individuals in the Deep State and I think there's a focus on the border and we all know what's been happening at the border right if he puts an end to this this ends the idea of a North American Union because folks let's face it that is the idea I mean this article came from the EU the European Union right they view Europe as one country basically that's how they want North  America to be that's why they don't care if we're being flooded they look at this as a good thing you know we'll just mix everything up and we'll consolidate power Trump is bad you know he he's going to work against them that so they really don't want this man in but if he's going to get in they are trying to kneecap him any way possible and quite frankly they they used the pandemic the first time the pandemic kneecapped this man the first time around along with the Deep State and it just to me again y'all  let me know what you think it just feels like the same Playbook all over again between the pandemic and the firewall being installed in Congress but I don't know that's my thoughts today y'all take care and God bless oh 	Conservative			Conservative	82

I've got to put what I really want to do on hold to make sure that the responsibility that I created is taken care of yeah I gave up I I tell people I I gave I gave my dream away for my kids and God gave it right back to me I feel like God was like since you showed that you was willing right I give it back to  you cuz I gave up I'm like ain't no way I wasn't man I had a job I wor at um company and then I got in the streets you know cuz that child sport started yeah working at The Southern Company ain't going to cut it not with that many kids no it was boy that that that child support check when they finally took child support out me and my partner Deon was walking and I stopped cuz this when you can see check oh they got oh you they garnished you yeah they garnished I say he was like what's wrong I said man  I don't think I can afford to take another step it's over I do not work at no power plant I work at the Dollar Tree man you see that money coming out ain't no way yeah yeah ain't no way so you says okay now let me ask your question there I mean there are not a whole lot of celebrity I think future I don't know how if you're cool with future I mean obviously Nick Cannon that's kind of like your same cuz he's comedian and and things of that nature do you talk to other celebrities have you talk to other  celebrities that have a large number of kids oh me and t I talk but he ain't got many as me but man to be honest man you know um you know once you get everything right in like I spend a lot of time with my kids my kids stay right around I catch one of my son games U Got a son of college balling right now my daughter's dance my daughter's cheerlead um you know we spend a lot of time together but um they all pretty much family men U especially TI you know they be around their kids as much as they can that's the only one I really  talk to right right so did you put yourself on child support when you when you when did you come to the conclusion and say you know what this is what I'm going to do I'm going to do this for you you you you and so because you know sometimes they they go they go the maternities get expensive yeah get real expensive so you try to settle this before it get to that point yeah I I did that I I put myself on child support but man that child support that ain't a problem they really need more you you find out they need more than  that right it cost a lot to really raise those kids for real man they asking that Mama every day so I just came to the realization cuz I was that child right that uh my dad to drop off some money but that ain't enough right so you know I just man you know what I always just gave him the paper I give him some more money man but you can't buy piece so I'm like get that money I get more of that right but I need my peace so how much to take care of your monthly expenses just with the kids and the kids  mom just with the kids and kids just with the kids and kids not your expenses not not what you cuz you got to live also but you got to make sure they they straight so what's those what's that expense okay not count my family or nothing not counting your family just the kids and the kids mom just with them probably 100 you know what I'm saying just with the baby Mas not count my family and not count me that's about 100 about 100 a month so but if you throw your family in there and throw you in there that's probably  another 100 on top of that that's 200 it's 200 with 100 know hold up no it's it's it's it's 300 with me it's it's it's 300 it's 2100 for me you know what I mean it's 200 for my family my kids you know what I'm saying I write my brother chair for one the month to pay everybody uh and then the credit they they spend about 40 month on their credit cards 200 a month just for family and uh kids Baby M so that's why you on the road all the time that's why you don't get no break you got to work yeah but see a lot of that though see a lot  of that in that 200 too man that's family working too cuz my brother work yeah because you told me your your brother I mean some of your kids help yeah so by by out of that 200 now my sisters work with me out of that 200 real work probably by fifth of that work okay fifth six of that but you know I thank God I make way over that just being real how how did you determine that you know what I'm going put my f because a lot of times you know we get in this position our family don't work we just give them free money but you  decided to put your family hey I'm hey you want you want some money you got to work yeah yeah yeah tax is like about 10 out of n now hold up now everybody get a1099 too that's part people don't know right but you put them to work because it's like when when you when when you reach a certain amount of money and you start realizing how the realizing how the tax game go you like hold up oh that's 50% you only got whatever they see they see 10 million count 5 million yeah so only thing is a 100% write off is a person  right so okay if if my sister work for me and I give her 10 piece a month right I'm really giving her five right you know cuz I going to have to give that to somebody anyway correct so you train the people around you and when the people around you start growing and learning man my money kept going up because everybody around me skilled now right and you know the paper coming in just I can't even count it no more man so how did you get to the point that says you know what baby mama straight the kids are  straight my family is straight now I got to focus on what I need to do yeah I just man I just felt like cuz every time I got some money I was like I don't feel right unless my sisters and my family you know I feel lonely I'm like man they got to be straight I can't just be visiting them so I didn't feel like I could focus on my real goal until I got them to a certain level at every level I got okay and that's what made me focus more on the gold because now I'm like I'm focused now because I I can take  care of my family I got some and I got enough to invest in my dream so now I'm really focused cuz I ain't got that guilt of looking at my sister who came out my mama like Dam whaty sis doing bad over there you know what I'm saying because your love in your heart can't you can't endore it right you know what I'm saying can't ignore it so let when you start to dat so how soon before you start to Da when you're dating someone do you start to take on some of their responsibility if not all of their  responsibility man I don't date no more like that like if I meet a person and I like them we come to agreement then if I like them enough okay you going to be around in my life for a long time let me uh let me figure out this off the rip cuz I know I'm going run into this anyway right so I kind of already I kind of already have it in my mind when I meet a person okay mhm so you you but because at this Junction now you know people like well hey he done you know he got this I might can catch him slipping  I might can get me one no you can't catch me slipping cuz I already slip I've been slipped to high school so I tell everybody a lot of people you know you can't catch me slipping cuz I already slipped cuz you going to slip in life anyway I slip so early I don't feel so many time man my shoes got grip now yeah you got you can't slip you can't slip a slipper right but that's that's an unbelievable uh country that you have been the situ ation that you're in it's less than ideal especially at the time now you  wouldn't trade anything for the kids that you that you have that you've been able to that all these people have been able to come together for the common goal and you've helped them realize that the most important thing is a kid all this bickering because at the end of the day I need to be at peace because I need to go get this paper I got to go get this paper and I tell I tell them that man they out they out grown it's to be a lot of drama wiers bu sty B this baby mama mad at this I went through all that but  now it's to the point man I got to admit those ladies put all that aside for those kids right and those kids they ready to get that paper like my son he helped being my he helped build my online business cuz I I had him in my skits and build story lines around him so man he helped his daddy build you know what I'm saying build his business from the ground and um man it's a it's love now man but I went through it it's tough though it's tough to get to that point it's tough in the beginning it's tough it's tough in  the beginning because don't nobody understand that everybody problem is your problem and when you got money they don't understand right but so I open up and share a lot of business with them so they can understand what's going on to be honest they went from sitting on their asss to switching that word around now they ass it right you feel what I'm saying wow that's unbelievable let me ask you this when you date are the women you date are they cool with baby mama and vice versa well last relationship I was  in N they weren cool cuz they don't never really meet the baby mama I ain't brought I haven't I haven't brought nobody new around I only been in three relationships my high school sweetheart uh what you be high school sweetheart you got like five baby bombers in high school how no I got one baby bom High School other one came when I was 20 okay so high school sweetheart then I did did one of my baby mom for 6 months we T we was together for 6 months and then my ex my ex-wife and then uh my last relationship so I only been in four  rear relationship right mhm but they cool so how so let me ask you a question so what about the kids when you start dating do you bring them around the kids or do you hold up not my last relationship I didn't so I haven't been in other relationships besides the mothers of my kids only been in one relationship outside the mother of my kids and she never met any of my kids okay so you was able to keep keep that so how so how is it dating you you're a very public figure now ain't no more ain't no more secrecy like you could do  at high school and like you do early on in life you could be over here do that right here go back over there do that right there ain't no more of that c ain't no more of that bro it ain't yeah but shoot me I just hey man if I like a person we kicking it I ain't and if you with all that publicity and trying to get that sauce or whatever trying to I ain't with that so because if we like each other we like each other know what I'm saying now if we really into each other like that we could go public but I really ain't man I'm really  focused you but you know the thing is women some women not all some not all like what you hiding mhm you don't want people to know that you got somebody so you can still do this over here yeah that's real that's real but no with me to be honest I made a living I made I made a movement off my story line right and u i be in relationships to my storyline okay so a lot of Reason be like man okay I don't want to be in no public relationship because it mess up my storyline correct it makes that more real even though it's a storyline what I  do online so I came up with a conscious decision man I a I'm not letting nothing get in the way of my paper correct so it's business it's a business reason why I do it I'm like man we can't be what's that's going to benefit me or just being in public with somebody I ain't yeah dating in public don't make me no money no it don't make me no money so what we really if we really like each other um CU soon as we get the public involved this going to you not are are you going to be able to handle what's what's about  to come with this right and I'm like you know now they triggering you cuz they bringing up my past relationships they bringing up the kids as long as we happy and we in private you cool but I already know what come with that so I'm like it's going to anything that get in the way of my money you ain't about that N I ain't about I look at it like this here you tell me if I'm right or wrong or you agree to some extent I believe if you if you date privately you can break up privately and if you have issues you can deal with  them privately yeah but if you date publicly you got to break up publicly and you got to deal with that public exactly and sometimes that get bigger than what you're doing right and and that don't sell tickets that don't make money it seem like it do it's clout but it ain't money you know what I'm saying so i' be like no that a't man that ain't worth it what type of woman pequs country Wayne's interest somebody who cook some vegan food cuz I'm

BBL yeah I paid for it what the H are you you don't like bbls but you pay for get because that's what that's what they like so if you think you need that I'm not going to argue with you because then if I argue with you and and uh convince you not to do it it's still going to be in the back of  your mind right so you pay for breast augmentation I pray for I pray for it if that would make you and then when you get it I'm uh why we don't talk no more man Wayne it's too hard man they don't I can't feel the bone no more it was like I like you like that you do realize my grandfather used to say boy you got to be careful fattening frogs for another snake to eat yeah they can eat it food out there please but plenty of time I've been saying somebody please come get her you don't you don't fix the car up and  don't care if somebody else driving man that's money we get more money we get I can't get time back time is the most valuable thing give me give me give me your idea if somebody would to say okay crunchy rain give me everything that you really want in a woman to be by your side let's just say you looking for wife give me some of the attributes some of the traits What must she have and what can she do to make sure she's with country Reign moving forward love herself more than she love me I want a woman who so in involved in  herself that she become better every day okay and and make herself happy okay that's what I want because I tell a woman man and this it ain't even a woman it's it's it's it's with your kids relationships business you cannot give nobody more than what you got in you if you think you are you pulling from somewhere else in you that and that's what call stress that's what call anxiety cuz you you stretching the Rope too hard right man if you work on you enough right you going to be alert on other things right so I I just you know  it's like finding greatness in yourself when you great you see the greatness in everybody like when people ask me about comedians I tell people man all comedians funny I never met a comedian who wasn't funny than me it might be to a different crowd or whatever but it's so when I meet a woman man love you I'm going help you and love love you more what whatever you need to help yourself so that mean you might just drink more water mm I tell come on now you can least drink water now if you ain't drunk  enough water during the day right that's easy to do I understand some things you can't do you might got trauma but water right you can get that that's 99% of the problem right cuz if you don't got water you going to be dehydrated and you going to get a dehydrated thoughts and whatever you come up with ain't going to last cuz it's it's dehydrated you know what I'm saying so I I just like man I want a woman love herself man so in other words you don't want to be a hype man you don't want to have to constantly  tell a woman how beautiful she look how fine she is how intellectual she is I want her to come tell me I know who I am so if you want to go over there that's your loss and show me that you know I want somebody to really believe that believe in themselves because I believe in myself like that corre and when cuz I know when you love yourself nobody really can't tell you nothing you don't care about what people say when you truly love yourself nothing triggers you like that's man people never seen me  really say nothing online or nothing because I don't care if people knew how much I didn't care not a little bit cuz I love Wayne right I love Wayne right yeah so is that is that one of the biggest thing women you you think women should care more about themselves love themselves more as opposed to trying to to please the man yeah because you going to give him all your love and he going to run away with it because you got to give you got to feel you up first when you feel you up trust me man when you do  touch him with Everything You Touch going to feel that right energy so it's like you got to fill yourself up I don't even know where to go with this one cuz I already know what you going to say about about gifts cuz you bu BB and breast augmentations I mean so I already know you hit them up with a car or something if you really like oh no I ain't that type I ain't really I ain't haven't gave no woman more than I gave the mothers of my kids okay now my mothers of my kids don't got cars and stuff but I'm the type of person man I'm  I'm not going to take you on no trip if your Brak scrubbing we we going to get them brakes fixed first we going to get the brakes fixed first if I know you got a bad tooth back here we ain't just keep putting the orig jail before we go do anything we going to the dentist so I'm going prioritize the gift oh you fix them up you a fix up you will fix okay how you do anything is how you do everything you know what I'm saying so if I like to start from the bottom and go to the so I'm not going to spin all  this money on no purse when you when when you need this done I see your your Ro see that's how I'm think we think a lot yeah you want a purse you can't skill to the purse if your student Al behind yeah or the kids need come on now you

I62	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqJhvUYLRzk	fake products false advertising ruthless scams these are the 13 most evil Tech fails that through Instant Karma have completely backfired for the Company's trying to make some quick cash ranging from pretty naughty to Pure diabolical starting with Nokia and their Lumia 920 in the phone's promotional material this company decided that they really wanted to emphasize the power of the 920's optical image stabilization so they created this situation where a guy was holding the phone on his bike and he was  using the phone to record this girl on another bike but viewers noticed something a little Sinister later on in the video the reflection of a person who was not the original cyclist holding the phone but in fact a completely different guy standing in a van holding a proper heavyduty film camera and that's because the video wasn't really filmed on the 920 it was filmed on this speculated to be a red Cinema Camera which I mean those things are like minimum $10,000 noia faked the entire ad and that's especially bad because this ad  doesn't just vaguely imply that it was shot on the phone it basically tells you that it was wait how did you break you can't do that in the age of the Reddit investigator meaning that Nokia was forced to make a public apology and pretty much soil the reputation of their one remaining successful product line it's all downhill from there free you can't beat the internet and that's something that Netflix also had to learn in 2011 you might know that Netflix actually started off as an online DVD rent by mail  service so people would use the website to pick what they wanted to watch and then the company would ship those out as discs alongside a prepaid return envelope but then as soon as internet connections started improving and people were also looking for alternatives to cable TV Netflix also introduced the option for subscribers to just stream a smaller selection of the movies and TV shows in their Library straight from their site like we do now and as Netflix's streaming business grew and they found that surprise surprise it was  cheaper to run than manually going to the post office and mailing people discs they needed to find a way to encourage people to choose that option that's where they went wrong in 2011 Netflix decided that they were going to split their streaming and DVD rental services which were previously all included for one price into not just two different tiers but two separate companies entirely renaming their DVD service to quickster it would involve users having to have two separate accounts two separate websites to navigate and also  two separate fees to pay the internet quickly came to the conclusion that keeping both subscriptions going after the split would result in a price hike of not 5% % or 10% but 60% leading 800,000 users to not subscribe to both but instead just cancel their existing subscriptions causing Netflix's entire stock price to plunge to half of its value talk about net flops it's 4 out of 10 fail and of course Netflix had to back out of the plan with their tail between their legs after only a month and this actually all remained one  service until they completely stopped renting out DVDs last year yeah they've still been doing it this whole time but it can always get worse as we're about to see with some increasingly immoral gaming fails do you remember when every video game Studio was rushing to implement nfts in their games companies realize that if they made their in-game items nfts then you could verify via the blockchain that they are well and truly oneof a kind which artificially increases their perceived value and if  you increase the value of your in-game items well that should drive more people to play your game for longer to earn them and create a marketplace where players could buy and sell them with of course the Developers taking a cut from each transaction oh my goodness wait that's the actual smoke alarm can you just uh dis that oh God just EA is probably the most notorious company for bigging up nfts not hugely surprising given they were voted worst company in America in 2013 but in recent years it has started  to feel like Ubisoft is gunning for the title because in 2021 they revealed their plans for playable nfts in games through a service called Ubisoft quartz starting with Ghost Recon however because actually designing thousands of one-of-a-kind exclusive items would take Ubisoft a long time they had a better idea to give everyone the same item with the unique twist being that each one had its own serial number just like every other product you've ever bought in a shop but what made it so much worse is  that the entire game was designed around those nfts each requiring anywhere from 100 to 600 hours to earn almost foring players who wanted them but still wanted to actually have a life to take out their real wallets and pay thankfully Karma bites back the trailer for Ubisoft quarts was delisted on YouTube almost immediately after it shot up to 95% dislikes and when the project eventually launched it was such a colossal failure that it will never not be funny the company likely lost millions in reputational damage from the move how  much did they make from the entirety of their nft efforts about $400 so they could buy about seven copies of their own game it's a five out of 10 but worse still is what happened to a game that I was personally really excited for one of my favorite video games of all time actually is Star Wars Battlefront 2 on the PlayStation 2 this game is basically sacred for Star Wars fans and so imagine our reaction when EA comes in and they say they're rebooting this exact game for the modern era in 2017 but with nextg realism I remember  wanting to dial every single person in my contacts list just to tell them how big of a deal this was we were all so caught up in excitement that the world almost completely forgot that it was e designing this game and thus the microtransaction riddled mess that it would end up becoming when the beta of the game dropped if you wanted to make basically any progress at all you would have to open up dozens upon dozens of completely randomized loot boxes until you got what you needed and if you wanted to do that without spending a  month literally glued to your television screen you were going to have to take out your wallet and spend real money now it's one thing to have paid items in a game it's a very different thing for those paid items to be randomized and most importantly to be be crucial to actually winning these boxes they didn't just contain skins and cosmetics genuinely game-changing character upgrades that were likely to be the difference between winning and losing players were not happy and they made their voices heard one player complained  to EA that it was basically impossible to unlock Darth Vader the most Shameless character to put behind a pay wall without paying real money and yep EA made it worse by responding to this by saying that the reason the characters were so expensive is because they wanted players to have a sense of accomplishment from getting them and this super condescending absolutely bold-faced lie completely blew up it became such a big Fiasco that even nonv video game news sites were reporting on it EA were actually taken to court by  the Belgian gaming commission accused of promoting gambling among underage players and they've basically been arguing their case in court ever since the game has improved but no one has forgiven the company to the point where new releases from the company are still being investigated as recently as 2023 now what you want about Ubisoft and EA at least they made the games that landed them on this list the same can't be said for raw raw was a massively multiplayer online life simulator that was promising enormous things the  initial trailer showed off entire towns with a full economy where every player has a job can purchase property and vehicles and take out contracts with other players you can even become the mayor and govern your server it basically looked like GTA online but with 100 times the number of complex systems and mechanics the trailers were flashy and well animated but it was all cinematics not real gameplay that said it did not stop a lot of people from backing the project on Kickstarter leading the game to easily surpass the  nearly $80,000 that the company was asking for in funding a lot of money absolutely enough to develop a game this sprawling not even close what these guys were trying to do here would have cost tens of millions of dollars and needed 100 developers at a minimum how many did they have two they had two people all signs were pointing towards scam and they so nearly got away with it but it was greed it was trying to convince people that they were actually working on something hoping they could squeeze  out just a little bit more in Kickstarter funding they made a fatal mistake they released a Gameplay trailer of the game that didn't exist and as soon as the internet saw it people immediately realized that the whole thing from the furniture to the players Running Animation were all stock assets clearly just pulled together from the unity asset store that people would use as a base to actually build a game upon Kickstarter suspended their funding immediately and also slapped them with a fine of the total value of everything  they'd raised so far now you might have recently heard of the right to repair the idea that as a consumer you should be able to freely repair your own device rather than having to send it back to the manufacturer who are basically guaranteed to charge you more than it costs looking at eone companies but quite possibly the worst offender is the huge Farm tech company John Deere who started integrating engine control units into their equipment that once they detect any problem at all just shut down  many of the engines functions requiring specific software and tools to fix and where do you get those software and tools oh you go to John Deere ah now it makes sense this company was literally designing their products to make them purposefully difficult to repair while also refusing to provide Farmers or independent repair shops with the tools needed to do so which stings even more than the whole right to repair drama with iPhones because let's be honest practically no normal individual user is  actually repairing their own phone whereas in the case of farmers and their tractors it's a very normal thing to fix it yourself oh and your livelihood depends on it you're going to miss your entire Harvest waiting for John Deere to have to fix it and that's not even accounting for the enormous Bill you're going to get because of it so thankfully the company is currently facing two class action lawsuits accusing them of monopolizing the industry and given that their repair business makes them three  to six times the profit that they make on actually sell their gear it's looking less like John Deere more like OD deer can you imagine how stressful it's been having to research this video to learn all the excruciating details of this evilness the only thing that's got me through it is tful the Serene meditative State

browser AI we all face stressful things in our lives but by downloading the Opera browser using the link in the description you can at least find calm in your browser okay it's time to delve deeper into the depths of tech hell with a returning guest this is like the one series you don't want to be a  regular on on a past fails video we talked about the sheer negligence of Boeing with their 737 Max aircraft the next generation of the most popular aircraft in history that thanks to a whole number of poor decisions crashed twice leading to the deaths of hundreds of passengers it was a catastrophe and they've done it again when on the 5th of January 2024 the Boeing 737 Max aircraft flying from Portland to California had to return for an emergency landing shortly after taking off when the door came off I mean just imagine you're  flying at 16,00 F feet in the air you're barely 5 minutes into Shrek 2 on your phone when the door right next to the seats flies off into Oblivion miraculously only seven seats in that plane were unoccupied and two of those just so happened to be next to that door meaning that somehow not a single person was seriously injured but people lost their belongings one person had his shirt sucked off his body and if he wasn't wearing a seat belt there's a very good chance he would have gone with it side note kind of incredibly one  phone that fell out of the plane which looks to me like a 14 pro was actually found on the side of a road still working after that drop yeah as far as this 737 Max is concerned after this incident with everyone being completely shocked that this could even happen to a plane that had just come off the production lines 2 months ago around 170 of them were grounded so they could be inspected for potential issues with the doors after which both United and Alaska Airlines found multiple loose Parts including installation issues with the  exact same door plug that had caused the accident in nearly 10 of their 79 Boeing planes and then the Federal Aviation Administration found further manufacturing issues all but forcing Boeing CEO to have to admit to a lapse in quality control which you could argue is not evil it's just negligent but then I think persistent negligence in the face of even potentially fatal consequences feels pretty corrupt to me oh and the passengers of the Ontario flight are also suing them leading this to be our first six out of 10 Bill have  you ever heard of bit connect there's a good chance you saw or more likely heard this Unstoppable in 2016 when the new cryptocurrency bitconnect first [Applause] launched here's some advice that I think some people could have done with at the time if someone is literally having to yell at you about how good their virtual coin is don't buy it bitconnect if you take what they say at face value bitconnect seems crazy profitable users were being promised a 1% return on their investment every single day which if you  do the math means that if you dropped so much as $11,000 on day one then with it compounding every single day by the end of 3 years you would be on $50 million the guy was basically promising people free money and the crazy part of it was that it kind of worked while the value of one bitconnect started out at $0.1 the sheer fever these guys managed to create around this coin it rocketed the value all the way to a peak of 455 and then the authorities got involved this was one of the first of what would become many crypto Ponzi  schemes basically a scam where someone asks for an investment from you and then asks you to go and recruit even more investors you get paid but you're only getting paid because even more people are being lured into the Trap from the bottom of the pyramid and investing their money too and the problem with this is eventually the pyramid has to collapse cuz you can't keep finding bigger and bigger groups of new investors to support the growing weight from above so yes bitconnect was eventually forced to refund every single  one of its investors and over $50 million in crypto was seized from one of its Founders ouch 7 out of 10 but we're not always so lucky sometimes tech companies do something truly awful and they get away with it so just before number five here's a quick fire round of the ones that got away with the iPhone 14 launch Apple really pushed the boundaries when they tried to sell the fact that they were using the exact same chipset for the iPhone 14 as they used for the iPhone 13 as a feature to iPhone  14 when I saw this my jaw Hit the Floor csgo Lotto was a website where people could gamble with real money for collectible weapon skins in the game Counter-Strike Global Offensive the site came out of nowhere when it was suddenly massively promoted by two gaming YouTubers who kept posting videos of them winning big and encouraging their mostly younger viewers to get involved and because it managed to carefully swerve gambling laws there were no restrictions on under 18s joining it until it was revealed that these two  YouTube ERS were the owners of the site and they must have been making bank because they were exposed for paying other influencers up to $225,000 each to promote the site but what happened when they got sued for promoting well gambling for children well they literally got away with being told don't do that again Amazon is widely regarded as being the worst big tech company for how it treats its staff in terms of stress encouraging delivery drivers to make 150 plus stops in a single day often causing them to skip  meals and even bathroom breaks in terms of safety with ambulances having been called out over a thousand times since 2018 in just the UK from Amazon warehouse staff and in terms of just general ethics with up to 18,000 workers recently fired in one go most found out via an email but up until this point it hasn't caught up with them in any meaningful way and then while every taxation system around the world charges you more the more money you earn the big six tech companies Amazon alphabet Facebook Netflix apple and Microsoft  have each individually managed to sneak their way out of it by situating their headquarters in low tax zones even though those aren't the zones they're primarily operating in they've managed to get away with paying just $219 billion in taxes between 2010 and 2020 now that might sound like a lot these are the richest companies in the world and that accounts for just 3.6% of their total revenue for reference people earning high amounts here in the UK pay 45% okay if you're enjoying this video then a sub to the channel would be  Wicked right no companies getting away now it's time for the top five companies who are truly evil and who got punished just as badly for it starting with Wei work the company who practically invented the concept of buying out Office Buildings and then renting out individual floors and spaces to businesses and aspiring entrepreneurs and we work generated a lot of buzz it was great for networking it was great for motivating people who would otherwise be sat in their parents' basement it gave business people a more  typical working life structure which as someone who works some pretty odd hours I can see the benefit of as could a lot of people cuz in fact at its peak Wei work was valued at an absolutely eye-watering hard to even think about 48 billion but nobody is immune to this series and practically the sole reason we work failed is their extremely irresponsible CEO Adam Newman this guy had something so good on his hands but he just kept making unbelievably Reckless decisions like buying a $60 million private jet before the company  had even gone public investing heavily into a company that makes artificial wave pools or like when Newman changed the company's name from Wei work to we company which is a name he just so happened to have recently trademarked himself so that he could sell that name to the company making $5.9 million in personal profits but the final nail in the coffin came when wework eventually decided to go public now when a company goes public and everyone starts buying shares most CEOs they tend to wait for  this moment before selling their own shares to maximize the value Newman for some reason just decided to take out his entire $700 million in stock basically the night before meaning that at the point where we work actually became available to buy their now public stats just showed enormous losses which does not work Newman's continued poor leadership it got this company to a stage where they were so poor they couldn't even afford to fire their employees leading to him asked to resign a CEO wew work is still around but it  hasn't got even close to their dizzying original valuation since but some fails stem from nobler goals than just trying to make a quick barck like for instance trying to solve world hunger like when scientists at mit's media lab developed what they were calling the food computer basically a pod designed to grow perfect crops with LEDs sensors pumps and precision machine learning algorithms constantly tweaking the internal climate the idea was to sell thousands of these things to Farmers to create massive  agricultural servers which would allow anyone to grow anything and absolutely revolutionize farming as we know it they even announced that they already started sending units to a refugee camp which could really help people except they hadn't it turned out the Project Lead Caleb Harper was just straight up lying about that for publicity and it turned out that wasn't the only thing he was lying about because in 2020 it came to light that the food computer itself didn't even work in the first place this  guy had gone as far as to get his team to go out and buy potted plants from a store plant them in the computers and pass them off as specimens that have been grown from scratch from inside the devices MIT obviously fired Harper and shuttered the project immediately but it just gets worse because it turns out that the project had also been polluting the local water supply with toxic nitrogen infused Wastewater the whole time so MIT were fined too but I can't think of a more continuous lapse in judgment than what happened recently  with Reddit on April 18th 2023 Reddit announced changes to their data policies so they could monetize their data better essentially before this happened a lot of tools will be able to freely access reddits data which means moderators who look after the various communities could create tools that help them to actively approve and reject posts as they come in that a lot of users were free to use third party tools to browse Reddit in a more organized efficient way and also that Reddit had become like the perfect  place to train new AI models cuz it's just 18 years of pure human conversation so if you ever wanted to build an AI that talks like us and thinks like us then it's a gold mine and this AR Arrangement worked out quite well almost all these moderators were basically doing reddit's work for them for free Reddit was earning healthy amounts of cash via the ad revenue from the site and the platform was also just doing a general service for the internet but Reddit didn't like that they decided that they wanted to start charging for  the use of their data partly to obviously make more money immediately but partly because they knew this would also allow them to charge the third party Reddit clients like Apollo which since they have to access Reddit data to work bucket loads of cash like in the casee of Apollo these charges would literally have cost the app $20 million per year in data charges so they were forced to shut down remember this isn't just a normal company deciding to up the prices of their products this is a company that's almost built by the  people who saw their work as a form of Charity as a way to help share information that they felt like makes the world a better place and so when redditors caught wind of what had happened they were outraged it became Global News and many moderators of the subreddits they started to go dark in protest either by privating those subreddits or activating the not safe for work tag so their content can no longer be monetized by Reddit at the beginning of the protest over 7,000 subreddits went dark with some going  indefinitely Reddit then tried to calm things down by offering an ask me anything with their CEO Steve Hoffman but his refusal to budge only enraged users more he was constantly saying stuff like this is like a protest in a city that goes on for too long and that the moderators who are unpaid volunteers remember are like the landed gentry meaning people who have been handed undeserved power without having had to earn it themselves essentially this company once the social platform with the biggest active community in the  world continue to shoot themselves in the foot like this until their reputation was tarnished basically forever their Goodwill shredded which matters more so for Reddit than anyone not to mention the large hit to General engagement on the platform Aus hfil now it is hard to screw up more than that but I think Volkswagen takes it after what they did in 2015 it turns out that this company had been fitting their cars with engines deliberately programmed to activate their emissions controls only when they detect that they're in a  Laboratory test which basically meant that Volkswagen cars were programmed to have two modes one that meant they were actually terrible to drive with low power and mileage which would allow them to pass the Environmental Protection test and then the other mode that the drivers experienced which drove fine but was secretly pumping out up to 40 times the federal limit of some pollutants when it was found out that they had been doing this since 2009 with 11 million cars across the globe being fitted with  the test cheating technology this company rightfully got absolutely hammered facing eye-watering fines of $25 billion if that's not a 9 out of 10 fail I don't know what it is but quite possibly the biggest riches to rags fail that we've ever covered in any one of these videos is FDX so this is s bank mfried who in 2019 founded the company FTX what became the second largest crypto exchange a platform like binance where people could buy and sell their cryptocurrencies and people were all in on it a combination of Hefty marketing  budgets the promise of extreme returns and overnight riches and celebrity endorsements and big sponsorship deals like literally the Mercedes-Benz Formula 1 team and even the Miami Heat NBA team whose entire stadium was actually rebranded to the FTX Arena I mean these guys even had a Super Bowl ad with legendary comedian Larry David creator of Seinfeld and Curb Your Enthusiasm and bankman free was being hailed as God's gift to the world of crypto so how on Earth do you screw up from there well FTX was actually a mess what seemed on  the outside like the future of investing was on the inside just problem after problem stacked on top of each other the first being that they weren't being completely honest turns out that as well as FTX bankman freed also owned another crypto trading firm called alamida research he said that both companies operated completely separately but it turned out that he was secretly sending customer deposits from FTX so money that people are traded in to Alam research to then invest in Risky things to try and  turn it into even more money gambling with customer funds between companies without telling them is spectacularly illegal especially since we're not talking like thousands of dollars or even Millions this was done with $1 billion and there was an even more fundamental problem see the way that a crypto exchange should work is to constantly make sure that it has liquid assets lots of money to make sure that if any customer decides they want out that they want to swap their crypto back into dollar say that the exchange can  give it to them FTX did not have that the money that bankman freed told people he had was actually almost completely just other cryptocurrencies which already makes them unstable should anything happen to the crypto Market but most worryingly their largest asset was their own cryptocurrency called ftt let me just get the straight so Sam made a currency he assigned a value to that currency and then he used that value as the collateral to Finance his projects and gain Investments and what that meant  was that the ability of FTX as a platform to actually pay anybody was completely dependent on the current market value of ftt which is fine when it's doing well but then as soon as the ties started to turn against crypto which coincided with one of ftxs competing platforms deciding to get rid of every bit of ftt that they had in one Fell Swoop the market was suddenly flooded with ftt that no one wanted and its value collapsed FTX immediately lost large chunk of the value that they had but then it gets worse because as soon  as a ton of ftt is sold customers start to lose confidence in FTX to and so at the same time that FTX loses its money it has to give its money leading to a massive implosion bankruptcy of the company and Sam bankman freed facing up to 115 years in prison that's a 10 thanks for watching it really does mean a lot to me I'll catch you in the next one 	Liberal			Conservative	84
I76	https://youtu.be/nMUJSUo1Hcg?si=fUeienvCgULB7NhC	good morning i hope y'all are doing fantastic wherever you are welcome back or welcome to my channel i don't know how you got here but i am so glad you're here i hope you stick around and smash that subscribe button now we have been staying up to date with all the developments and all the things happening with the todd and julie chrisley case coming out of atlanta yesterday lindsay chrisley took the stand and we are about to take a deep dive into what has happened in court the past couple of days  prosecutors in the bank and tax fraud trial of reality star couple todd and julie chrisley rested their case after seven days of testimony witnesses including bankers a former employees and former business partner were called to testify to an atlanta federal jury to bolster prosecutors contentions that they crucify used a fake financial statements to acquire millions of dollars in loans which they overspent on a lavish lifestyle prosecutors allege that in years before chrisley knows best aired the couple  took out at least 30 million dollars in loans from banks which they lied to receive and spend it on a lifestyle they couldn't afford when they became famous earning 6 million dollars in the first three seasons the couple tried to hide their money from the irs prosecutors say now we all know you can't hide from iris we all know that each of the chrisleys and their accountant is charged with one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud five counts of bank fraud one count of conspiracy to defraud the united states  and one count of tax fraud julie chrisley is also facing one count of wire fraud and one count of obstruction of justice the chrysler's accountant peter tarantino was also charged with one count of conspiracy to defraud the united states and two accounts of willingly filing false tax returns they have all denied the charges todd chrisley ran a successful business chrisley asset management which managed and resold foreclosed properties for banks the company did especially well during the great recession when  americans were losing their homes at high rates despite this success with a former accountant estimating the company bringing in about a million dollars a month the chrisleys were still overspending on an opulence lifestyle outside of their financial reality several people who worked at the company testified todd chrisley's business partner mark braddock and former accountant elena clary testified that his former boss would take money from the business accounts for his personal expenses leaving nothing there to pay  employees or the bills when they try to rein in his spending or deny him distributions from the accounts which were often far in the hole todd chrisley would throw expletive that means explosive field tantrums they describe or explicit chlorine said he once called her a fn russian bish basically when she denied him money from the company account braddock who testified he had an intimate relationship with todd chrisley for about a year and then became like brothers told the jury he committed fraud on behalf of the chrisleys and  himself the former part owner of todd chrisley's management company who was granted immunity to testify said todd chrisley would direct him on how significantly to inflate personal financial statements before submitting them to banks for loans now why was he granted immunity if um he was the one that went through with all this i mean that's that's an honest question that i have banks thinking he was more wealthy than he was would give him millions of dollars in loans which he used on bentley's mercedes mansions designer  clothes and flying to and from los angeles every four to six weeks for haircuts testified but i thought he testified earlier that he flew for haircuts to la twice a month i thought that's what he said twice a month now it's every four to six weeks okay braddock said he committed the fraud in part because of the intimate feelings he had for chrisley even after their affair ended braddock and chloe eventually got so tired of the way chrisley was running his business that they began an attempt to start their own company without  telling chrisley that testified in july of 2012 chrisley locked them out of the building and accused them of stealing money from them braddock then turned him into the fbi and state officials admitting his own crimes in search of both protection and vengeance he testified todd chrisley's defense attorney painted braddock as obsessed with chrisley and said he was the only one who committed crimes but prosecutors presented evidence that the chrisley's fraud continued even after braddock was out of the  picture plot twist after brad expiring julie chrisley allegedly submitted inflated financial records in an attempt to secure a 13 million dollar a month los angeles rental 13 million dollars a month what now you gotta be pretty ignorant with your money to to even consider 13 million dollars a month which they were almost instantly late on paying rent for eventually the landlord asked them to leave the property julie chrisley also sent emails to the chrisley knows best production company y'all get this  with a furniture repair estimate on a fake letterhead of a local interior designer who testified that he had never seen the document and it was not from him while the couple's former accountant peter tarantino is also on trial testimony related to his role and the conspiracy was limited to knowingly lying to investigators about the couple's taxes which they hadn't filed for several years tarantino prosecutors say was involved in sending fake tax documents showing high earnings to banks while submitting  taxes showing low earnings to the irs the defense will call its first witness thursday now that was yesterday y'all ready y'all ready to hear y'all ready to hear from lindsay chrisley lindsay chrisley told an atlanta federal jury on thursday that was yesterday that her dad was there to support her when she was getting treatment for an eating disorder in 2008 when her brother kyle was in the throes of addiction between 2009 and 2012. he was there to support him too we were trying to get him help looking  for him on the street todd chrisley's eldest daughter said on the stand of her brother before choking up during that time which is the same period todd chrisley is accused of bank and tax fraud his focus was on his children and not his business she told the court while testifying for the defense her father's top priorities she said are his children and his wife in that order now here's where here here's the kicker on cross-examination however prosecutors pushed chrisley's 32-year-old daughter to talk about a different side to her  relationship with her dad entering emails into evidence that shows she reached out to fbi after her father's indictment begging for their assistance in getting a restraining order against him he had been harassing her and threatened to exploit her she told law enforcement in emails during a meeting i am in no way shape or form connected to this monster she wrote in 2020 federal prosecutors have accused todd and his wife julie chrisley who star in the usa network reality series chrisley knows best of evading taxes and  operating conspiracy to defraud banks by making it appear they were wealthier than they were when the banks caught onto them the chryslers filed for bankruptcy walking away from 20 million dollars in debt the couple went on to hide money from the irs prosecutors say lindsay who has taught chrisley's daughter from a former marriage evaded questions by the prosecution about contacting the fbi and was combative in her responses her answers became so sarcastic that the members of the jury had outbursts  commenting on her attitude y'all get this you're not doing anybody any favors by answering questions like that judge eleanor ross eventually interrupted trust me trust me lindsay chrisley told the jury that she hadn't talked to her father for about two years before he reached out to her in 2019 and asked her to meet up when they met up at a rib shack she thought he was going to apologize for issues they had but instead he was just letting her know about the upcoming indictments she said about two months later she told  investigators that her father and brother chase were threatening to release a sex tape she also went on dr phil on the dr phil talk show to talk about the alleged extortion during her testimony thursday lindsay said she doesn't believe her father was involved in the extortion and has learned there was never was a tape it ruined my life she said lindsay chrisley and her brother kyle and are taught chrisley's children from a former marriage but when she was 19 she asked her stepmother julie to adopt  her she said when she was in high school in early college she worked for her father's company chrisley asset management in the office she said during that time her father owned the company with mark braddock the man who admitted to committing bank fraud on chrisley's behalf and who ultimately turned him into the fbi lindsay testified that braddock had a napoleon complex and would use her father's personal email account and instant messaging account in the office while she was there she believed that braddock hated her and  her siblings and didn't like when she was in the office braddock testified earlier in the trial that he had an intimate relationship with todd chrisley defense witnesses including lindsay chrisley have testified that braddock was rude demanding and belittling at work she then tells a story when she was around 19 or 20 she was living in a townhouse owned by her father with the conditions that she kept her grades up stay healthy and not invite over boys one day braddock entered the townhouse uninvited found lindsay chrisley in bed  with her boyfriend who she later married took photos of them on his phone he told her he took them for safekeeping lindsay said she was scared at the time and she was that she was going to lose her housing so she didn't tell her dad i would be telling on myself she said eventually she quit chrisley company the chrisley you know the man whatever when braddock told her that her father was having an affair with his assistant lindsay chrisley said she believed him at the time i wasn't going to stay around and see it she said  after quitting she gave back everything that her father owned changed her number and tried to make it on her own she testified later she learned the affair wasn't true lindsay chrisley appeared in a few seasons of chrisley knows best before 2017. now she and her family are coexisting she said i have their grandchild what are y'all's thoughts and opinions thus far i'm ready to hear the defensive side now we've just heard a little piece the beginning of the defense's side lindsay is the first witness i'm sure  the other kids savannah's probably going to get up there i wonder if 95 is going to get up there y'all but i will say this did y'all notice that the judge had to tell lindsay chrisley basically to you know calm it down because the way she was answering the questions wasn't gonna get her nowhere [Laughter] let me tell you something let me tell you something i

whole year when I started doing YouTube you know how much I made $100 hundred dollars and this  girl was making $9,000 a month when she first started what am I doing on YouTube up my my stage I guess for my job I'm pretty simple when it comes to filming content I like to just use my tripod and I like to keep things pretty personal kind of like the girlfriend experience nothing too crazy yeah ready to go an only fan model who makes $250,000 a month but is recording her only fans on an iPhone 14 an iPhone 13 or 14 not even the pro version that has better quality which you obviously need that for your job but you're using a  regular iPhone you might be making 250 a month but uh 15 Pro three cameras 15 Pro oh what's my name my name is lazy did you say something did you want to talk to me about something yeah go ahead oh what's this three cameras iPhone 15 Pro I'm not going to shame her for sleeping with 300 people I'm going to shame her for having a regular iPhone what if she has a regular iPhone just so she can say that she's humble like oh guys look at me I just like you poor people I have a regular iPhone the only difference is  that I make 250k a month I honestly was just sharing it for fun then I was just they always start things for fun I thought it was good to break the stigma of women being sexual we started really enjoying my content and that's when I came up with the 300 people in a year the most that I've slept with in a day is five that's it a lot of the people that I sleep with on dating apps the guys that I've met so far I wouldn't say that I would say myself being with them long term I feel like the only person who would date her  longterm would be a guy who also sleeps with 300 women a year and she's only slept with five people at the same time the most that I've slept with in a day is five oh my God rookie numbers how about 35 people in a day huh no I'm just kidding what was their name again uh the girl with the broke people iPhone please do not take that as a challenge you don't have to sleep with 35 people in a day that was a joke she really just spends her entire day texting potential guys who she wants to have sex with like  her entire life she's eating and texting people sleeping and texting people and and texting when you think of it she's literally some some dude and then texting some other dude like hey this guy will be done in like uh how many minutes do you have left 2 minutes in 2 minutes will you be here in 2 minutes some people have been super supportive like go girl you do you slay and SL suck those penises I think that there's definitely a stigma with women being sexual as opposed to men I think people accept men  as being sexual beings whereas women are seen as nonsexual beings which is incorrect what women are not sexual beings is that her excuse for sleeping with 300 with 300 people a year she's like I actually decided to break the stigma that women cannot have sex and guess what I slept with 300 guys a year did I miss anyone oh Pablo oh I didn't see you there cuz you kind of you're short yeah is it down okay yeah hold up give me a sec Pablo I need to get the elevator for that I can just imagine all the other  women right now being like thank you so much for sleeping with 300 people here and proving that we as women can also have sex your vagina might have taken a huge hit but at least you proved it to us that we can have sex the real victim here is her vagina Justice for her vagina suffering I honestly don't let the Judgment that I get online really bother me that much well you should when you do what I do for work you have to have a thick skin well you don't really have to have a thick skin when you're always  surrounded by other skins I'll [Music] stop hey Mom what did you think when I first told you about the content that I make well you didn't tell me I was online and there was a newspaper and I thought why is my Annie in the newspaper uh because she's been sucking 300 a year my first concern was that you would reach a certain age and what would you do afterwards that was your first concern that she would reach a certain age and what she would do afterwards it was in the fact that you you just read a headline that your  daughter slept with 300 people in one year I mean okay yeah the only fans whatever she does only fans who cares but you are not shocked at all by the fact that oh my God is my daughter okay like any diseases or like what is going on with my daughter she's up with 300 people a year but uh what is she going to be doing for money after a few years when people stop buying her only fans so sweetie I know a couple old guys that would do a lot of things mom definitely has the priorities straight what are your thoughts on the number of  guys that I slept with last year I know you very well and and I feel like you know what you're doing perhaps you want to try to show that a woman can have control of what she does in her life that she can say no she can say yes consent is such an issue at the moment a woman can make decisions about herself yeah yeah like I'm sorry but this has nothing to do with consent you were asked a question what do you think about me sleeping with 300 guys and she's like every time I think about you sleeping  with 300 people you know what I think about you know how there's people around the world starving and they're dying of starvation but you know who's not starving That Coochie that's why I'm proud of you sweetie keep it up sweetie how much money am am I getting after this like cuz my bank is starting to look a little low on the oh after the okay perfect stop this is reminding me of that Mom that was also using her daughter to make only fans content hey you know what if my daughter was making $250,000 a month I would also be like  suck those dicks sweetie yes five a day you should do 20 a day sweetie and use the technique that mommy taught you yeah the double gripper that will teach them get that bag sweetie and uh share some of that bag with Mommy no I'm kidding that was a joke please don't take that seriously so would the child service stop you from doing what you do no I don't think they ever would I mean I'm just doing my own thing I've been dealing with hate now for probably 3 years since I started my spicy page mom  would you ever want to change what I do for a living I want you to choose what you do I trust you whatever you choose to do I'll be there you that's money talking all right mom I've got to go now but I love you okay Mom I got to go it's dick o00 the the way she just dodged the question like a it depends on how much money we're talking about sweetie only fans 200k a month versus a nurse who only makes like what 150 130k a year that's disgusting sweetie stick to those dicks my name is Alex I am one of  Annie's close friends we actually lived together last year what did you think when you first heard about my content creating I think I was a little bit shocked and surprised at first the way I had found out about it we had only been living together for about a month yeah it was also an awkward thing to just come out exactly exactly so she was living with her for a month and all those guys coming in there was a different person coming in what every other day these guys would come to their house and she would see them walk by  every day and she would never suspect this that this girl was doing only fans or something there's no way that she was that stupid she was like oh one two three four five oh you guys are going to the library to study together how did I not think of that before that's why you always have those glasses those books and those cameras with you cuz like you record yourself studying and that's why you're always sweating when you come back cuz you like you study that much wow was she that stupid or how did  she not figure that out because initially the way that I found out about it was from an Instagram post which me a little bit there was probably a little bit of a side to me that I think safety issues like I did wonder how are you sort of safe with all of the guys that you have been with the last year I feel like I'm very safe when it comes to it how am I safe oh sweetie trust me when you comes to safety safety is my number one priority if one of these guys decides not to pay don't worry about my safety worry about  their safety yeah Tas are their ass also if one of them complains that they didn't like the head that I gave him no I mean like diseases and stuff how do you oh oh with that I just Ed a plastic rubber you can only film with creativ if you're clean cuz we do like full STI checks every two weeks and if one of them lies like using prote ET I feel like I do it very well but obviously there's always risk and get you're coming from do you ever worry about what people think it only bothers me what my close friends and family  think only bothers me when I only make below 200k a month because when I make above 200k a month who gives a trust me for 200k a month nothing would bother me [Music] either do you usually approach a guy that you like the look of or do you wait for them to approach you if I see a guy that I like I'll approach him and maybe like do it at the bar so it's more casual yeah but otherwise I feel like I'll just let them approach me um you know I'll get might give them the eyes from across the room and then they'll  come over and uh come over I see what you that was intentional yeah come over I can just imagine entering her dungeon I mean her bedroom and the smell being absolutely insane oh so this is your room oh my God the smell oh my I can't breathe I can't [Music] breathe definitely condom always got to be safe maybe two maybe five just to be safe I'm hoping next year to hit 600 in a year so we'll see how we go this year and then maybe that's my next year's challenge what's the difference between a man sleeping with five people why does  she keep making this about gender the advice that I'd give to other women who want to explore their sexuality would be just for it trying to beat the stigma this is called an addiction you just spent almost 9 Minutes promoting sleeping with 300 guys and doing only fans what has this to do with the stigma and gender this entire time it was literally just you promoting your only fans and you sleeping with 300 people what were people supposed to learn from this sleep with 300 people because nothing will happen to you people will  judge you but you will be fine so yeah go suck some dicks like I feel amazing it really is one of the best things I've ever done so highly recommend highly recommend highly recommend the people sleep with the people sleep with 300 people actually next year 600 people a year highly recommend oh my God that poor vagina for the first time in my life I'm going to be praying for someone's vagina the mom is getting money and material things from the daughter that's why she's okay with it actually I did take a look at her  Instagram account and it does look like she brings her mom to a lot of places they went on vacation and whatever and I'm wondering if the mom is recording her videos because you do need someone to record the uh not that I know anything about that but I'm just saying you do need someone to hold the camera and who else but the mom I'm just going to call her The Peasant with the broke people iPhone oh my God she didn't even have a pro iPhone like okay she makes 250k a month so I'm pretty sure she's laughing at me

I88	https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=GvLg_1NLRVg	Mr smestad will you please state your name and spell your last name Andrea baldazo b a l d a zo o and what do you do for a living I'm a registered nurse um where do you work uh Fairview lak in Wyoming what town do you live in uh Forest Lake um do you recall July the day of July 30th of 2022 yes I do um what were you doing on that day um my family and I had gone boting on the or uh tubing on the Apple River do you recall where you put in on the Apple River where we put in yeah uh the river's edges where we parked and we got  in there all right um who were you with generally speaking my husband my three children that are teenagers um a group of friends with us and my husband's cousin um were you folks having drinks yes did you specifically have some alcoholic drinks I did you remember how many I think it was two to three I had two white Claws and I think I had a sip of Shell's Keem and Jacks do you think you were impaired uh buzzed not not drunk all right at some point as you're floating down the river did you become  involved with an incident um where some folks have been injured yes tell us how that started um we had grouped our our tubes together we had tied them together and so I ended up kind of on the back end and I was floating down the river backwards and my husband said those people are having a good time or they're having quite a party something along those lines and I turn my head to the right and I could see um one person laying down on the River's Edge and another person further down and people were what I had thought was laughing but  turned into screaming um yelling what did you do when you when you saw uh I I knew somebody was hurt and so I jumped off the raft and ran across the well I kind of it was so slow I was trying to run fast but the water was too thick so then I ended up kind of falling forward an army crawling across to him and when I got up there was um a blonde boy did you know who that that boy was did you find out later who it was yes who was it Isaac um did you approach Isaac I did um where was he located by the time you got to  him he was um on the bank kind of with his right arm in the lake in the whatever the river um there was a kind of a cops of trees um right before where he was laying and kind of up into the edge there and then um a little further down there was somebody else sitting I thought was sitting by somebody else do you mean somebody else like another another somebody hurt did you focus your attention on Isaac I did when you arrived to where Isaac was was did your nurse training kick in yes so he was lying on his back  um his eyes were open but not blinking uh he was not breathing so I started chest compressions uh right away and continued that for a long time did you make a primary assessment of his wound I um I I saw that there was uh a large cut at first I thought he had been impaled on the set of roots and branches that were hanging down just prior to that but then I looked and it was a a slash mark not not an impale thing it was long and thin and clean cut where was it located on his body on his left chest upper chest kind of his ribs all  right so what I I asked um I was doing compressions and doing compressions and I um people were screaming and it was making me lose count so I think I yelled out to somebody shut up or stop screaming um so that I could count uh there were other people around I asked for somebody to get me anything that I could use as a chest seal Ziploc bag anything to put over that wound um I didn't want any water or anything getting in there but um I looked down at Isaac and um there was some vomit coming from his  mouth at some point so I asked to turn somebody the kid up front to turn his head which he did and the kid splashed some eyes or some water which got in his eyes eyes and I I said Don't splash water in his face anymore um and it just continued forever it felt like forever that we did compressions I kept asking where's the rig why isn't it here yet by rig do you mean what do you mean ambulance do you have an idea now as you sit here how long you you performed chest compressions on Isaac I said 45  minutes because I think that's I I thought that's what it was but somebody corrected me later that it wasn't it it felt like forever I mean we were going and going round after round other people were performing compressions we were singing Baby Shark to keep people on the Rhythm or you were taking turns giving him yeah yep and at some point um when somebody had taken over a round of compressions for me I got up and went to check uh walked just a few steps further down the river to check the other victim  but it looked to me like they were up in speaking and conscious so I went back to Isaac because he was not um do you have experience dealing with trauma cases yes uh at the hospital where you work are you involved in trauma care um I'm a primarily a med surge nurse but I do float down to the emergency room and involved in code situations what's a med surge nurse Med surge it's a medical surgical floor so typically we have posttop patients um anybody from pancreatitis to um just just a little bit of  everything I eventually did um law enforcement and EMTs arrive yes were you still with Isaac at that point yes was he taken off the river yes um did you see any of the altercation prior to to your giving care to Isaac I did not have you had any other involvement in this case no oh so when you testified earlier that your your husband had alerted you that he thought there was some kind of party going on do you know where abouts in the river you were um so where Isaac was laying just a little bit further um I guess if I'm  looking at Isaac laying on the ground and the second person was a little further down just a little further up were those roots and branches that I thought somebody had gotten stuck on um were you near the bend in the river in that location if you remember I I don't remember a Bend I mean the whole thing is windy so um yeah I mean I could show you on a map or picture we do have a blow up over the map if I can get that EX approach the yes ma'am I'm going to show you what's been marked is exhibit  258 I able to do this so that the jury can see to do you recognize this yes can you tell us what it is um the Apple River up you inic that you started at River's Edge correct so we came down this way um I would have been right here it we came around you're like want to do this way I'm sorry okay so we were floating this way and I guess yes then we must have just come around a little Bend because I'm guessing that cops of trees was right here and so I was floating backwards and it was on my right and you pointed at  the area on the exhibit that says incident location correct so your testimony you're coming oh I'm sorry yes this is the river that's the highway so coming around that bend yeah this Bend I'm sorry okay if this is the end down here and this is the start would you've been going this way I know it's hard to see yeah I I guess I just don't know which way the river goes oh so yes so this is the start and this is this is the exit right y so we would have come down this way and I would have been going backwards  here and it was on my right I don't have any other questions your honor Mr tresy I just have a couple questions for you um I think you said that you were tubing with your family is that right correct okay and your your husband was with you is that right correct okay and you your group or you and your husband and your children uh your husband brought a knife didn't he correct okay and can you tell us what was that what was that for uh we bring paracord with us when we go tubing um so if we don't bring paracord we'll use the  twine at the um River's Edge and we' pull our tubes together to carry our coolers our food and just kind of generally keep the group together cuz it's a bigger group when we go okay and and he uses the knife to cut that paracord apologies that's okay and do you remember or can you describe the knife that your husband hadit um it was a Flip Flip one uh where you flip it open and it locks into place and then you move the lever and it relocks okay and it had a clip on it if I said to you it's kind of like a pocket knife  that that is closed and then you can take the blade and you can open and lock the blade is that is that fair correct okay and only answer this if you know um your husband followed you after you jumped off your tube to run over to see what was going on or to render Aid is that that's correct okay do you know whether or not your husband pulled out his knife I don't have you talked to your husband about the case or about the incident um previous but we were asked not to speak about it later so we didn't but we we've talked about  it off and on over the years prior to this okay do you know that your husband's knife was lost I did after okay I I found out after that it had been lost do you know well I'll ask you this way his knife was lost near the incident right I I don't know at what point it was lost okay he he is I I don't know okay do you your your statement talks about um that your husband picked up a a snorkel did you see that I saw him pick it up yes okay when he picked it up did you see a confrontation happen then when he picked  it up or shortly thereafter when I say confrontation did you see people um starting to yell or um confront your husband about picking that up no no okay did you see your husband give that snorkel to the police uh no he picked it up out of the river after Isaac was going and it was just like a clear plastic clear white plastic mask and then I I don't know what he did with it afterwards I I don't know if he dropped it I don't know if he gave it to somebody that's all I have thank you man thank you Mr smad do you have any other  questions all right thank you Miss Balu thank you you are excused uh 	Leaning Liberal			Leaning Liberal	88
I96	https://youtu.be/ugSkcmqnwSk?si=hy-9kUspjQXCCwPH	with cryptocurrencies hitting new all-time highs and the Euphoria spreading through the internet like wildfire I thought to myself what better time to talk about one of the most fascinating hacks in cryptocurrencies often hacked history this is how an unknown entity broke into a Japanese exchange stole more than $500 million made their own cryptocurrency exchange and is still roaming free to this very day and I'm going to show you how they did it every step of the way and where the money is right  now 2012 Tokyo Japan kachiro W and Yuki atsuka created the Bitcoin exchange called reu press this exchange was basic in service but quickly grew in popularity due to being a relative early adopter in the growing Bitcoin world with the service growing and the industry evolving the creators decided to Rebrand the service to the much more recognizable coin check by 2018 coin Che was responsible for billions of dollars in user funds that were deposited in their exchange they got a haircut though on 2:57 a.m. local time Friday the 26th  of January 2018 hackers gained access to one of coin che's hot wallets that contained $523 million of a cryptocurrency called NCoin also called xcm the Japanese exchange never publicized exactly what had happened but what we do know is that one of the company terminals was somehow infected with malware this gave the hackers an initial access to the wallet in question onchain analysis made it possible to see where coin check had failed in their operational security the entire balance of $523 million of NCoin  was held in what is referred to as hot wallets they are hot because they're connected to the internet meaning you can move funds quickly and easily as opposed to a cold wallet which would be stored on an unn networked device which pose a different but more physical security challenge there are very few if any valid reasons to have half a billion dollars in a single crypto currency just sitting in a hot wallet but luckily for the hackers this is what they were greeted with so as the hack was occurring coin Che noticed that things  had gone terribly wrong and put out a warning informing users do not deposit any more n social media was quick on the uptick here people were speculating that something had happened to The Exchange as large sums of money had started to move very quickly and people watch for this within the next few days coin Che put out a press release confirming the hack had occurred which sent nem's price tumbling as a result at this time outlets around the globe reported on the situation calling it the largest hack in  history which was at least in 2018 accurate this also came with much speculation about what was going to happen to the funds and it was totally off since nobody shared the imagination of the coin check hacker masterminds so let's run through the timeline of exactly how it happened by the time coin Che had announced the situation to the world the funds had already been distributed to multiple different wallets for a technical breakdown of exactly what happened you'll see on screen that the initial nem wallet of  coin ja ending in 77 OG quickly distributed tokens in the amount of 92 million 100 million three times 50 million twice 30, 750,000 to a total of eight wallets in addition to this some of smaller transactions occurred after the initial flurry for a total of around 18 different addresses at this stage the NM developers were working closely with coin Che and the Japanese police to try and get out ahead of what they knew was coming next money laundering after all what good is $500 million of hacked  cryptocurrency that even an idiot like me can track in real time from point A to point B that money will never be spendable unless the hackers are allowed to mix up with other people's clean money obscuring the link between the hack and where it eventually gets turned to real world Cold Hard Cash to begin with the nem Foundation played mosaics in the tokens an onchain way to alert people specifically centralized cryptocurrency exchanges that this is hacked money in the hopes they would freeze the money if it entered and allow  for an eventual recovery they were trying to slow down how the money could move and any off ramps to get it into places that would make it harder to track later on but the hackers were one step ahead of the game on this one they initially filtered out the N between dozens of accounts sending from the initial dozen or so wallets to more as well as sending small amounts of the stolen cryptocurrency to seemingly random addresses this obviously didn't work too well because we can see them doing it clear as day and 500 million is  a lot to hide so that's where they had another idea and did something I've never seen before that no one could have predicted the hackers made a bet using an understanding of the human condition they exploited one of the most powerful elements of the cryptocurrency market greed on February 7th just a week or so after the hack occurred in a fascinatingly easy to follow and yet unexpected move the hackers sent out an onchain message to several other addresses which contained an announcement it opened with a link to a  dark web address and said simply XM 15% off this website link was a cryptocurrency exchange that the hackers themselves had created with one simple purpose to offer people stolen funds in exchange for clean funds to break it down you send us Bitcoin and we'll send you NM we take a 15% standard money laundering haircut and then what you do with the stolen money is completely up to you at first only a few accounts were biting the juicy bait on the line but as soon as people discovered they were not  being hauled up into the Open Arms of the police with this interesting offer but instead the Open Arms of an infinite money glitch they started to attack that bait like a sko of piran they essentially had an underground money laundering machine doing their work for them all based on human greed but as with anything on the blockchain this leaves a trace after all money is going from one address to another which made every person interacting with this offer a criminal but more on that later for now the moneya laundering operation was  a slow start but a fast success according to the timeline and research on the situation provided by yoichi Taya and naoki hiramoto with their science direct case report it took only 43 days for the hackers to sell out the NM tokens but what's interesting is what happened next as you can see thousands of Bitcoin moving from the hundreds of wallets used for the exchange sales all Consolidated to about 10 wallets but the main two are right in front of you here labeled as rcdn and F4 WK the largest wallet of  these Consolidated funds was the rcdn which had a total of 5,511 Bitcoins filtered through it with F4 wke having 2,949 instead tracking these Wallets on chain you can see that much like Shakira's hips the blockchain does does not lie we see the money coming in we see the money going out and it was a lot of money even for 2018 standards what you see on screen is money moving into a wallet we've highlighted with a green line and out of the highlighted wallet with a red line the Bold of the line the  more money involved in the transaction so this is where things could get very confusing and complicated but for the sake of Simplicity I'll break down the easy links and discoveries I made during my research for this video first though I want to explain something to you that made this story fascinating to me and occupied a lot of my time thinking about it in my time on YouTube I've covered a lot of cryptocurrency hacks frauds heists and otherwise illegal operations they almost always result in the  perpetrator being captured and when reading through the Case Files of the US federal agents who brought them to justice we see exactly how easy it is for them to find after all the blockchain shows us where the money is going and it can never be spent as real money unless offloaded to real cash which means that if we see the money on chain which we do as I'm going to show you we know that it eventually needs to break the link that makes it traceable for that you need something like a tumbler which takes in cryptocurrency  from many sources and then spits out cryptocurrency on the other side to Fresh wallet so the only link is essentially a black hole if you leave it in there long enough and take out small portions at a time there's no way to know whether it's from this hack or that hack or this person or another person if this doesn't happen we will always know exactly where it is or where it goes this hack doesn't have any break in the link we see exactly where it goes at all times and where it goes is to the only  place you can cash out cryptocurrency for real cash centralized exchanges such as coinbase buybit binance and others this is the point where usually I'd be reading from a case File of how the FBI had sent a subpoena to these exchanges who have logs of IP addresses for accounts accessing their services they'd have kyc details including names and bank accounts and addresses pictures of ID if there was 10 of millions hundreds of Bitcoins thousands of Bitcoins going into these exchanges they should know  who has them but that's the confusing part because I've tracked much of the Bitcoin there's a link to dozens of exchanges as clear as day to follow and yet this story has not been in the headline since 2018 when the hack occurred no one has been arrested no one is even talking about this hack anymore it's like $500 million vanished and nobody remembers knows or cares while researching this video I was shocked to find that no one remembers the details or as far as I can tell has been investigating where the money eventually  ended up so here are my findings they're not complete as I felt the futility of continuing for simple YouTube video but you'll see most of the stolen and laed Bitcoin in these examples the Lesser funded F4 WK Cent Bitcoin to 11 total wallets six that were never interacted with by the other wallet and five that were the main wallet on the other hand send funds to six shared wallets and two Independents after this it gets tricky because essentially what you're doing is tracking transactions between wallets  that often Branch into multiple paths with multiple inflows and outflows of currency until the point that you're looking at a web of thousands of wallets interacting with each other with without a visualizer or complex tools tracking this would be incredibly labor intensive even with it it can be difficult so some of the transactions to centralized exchanges are as follows June 13th 15th 22nd and 27th as well as July 4th of 2019 312 Bitcoin was deposited in five transactions to a poex account valued at  the time $2.5 million total June 7th 88th 13th and 201 7th 290 Bitcoin across four transactions entered crack in exchange for $1.6 million total December 27th 2018 744 Bitcoin entered bitfinex in a singular transaction valued at $2.8 million these are just small examples there were other larger wallets that seemed to be linked to other activity which show thousands of Bitcoin passing through them ingoing and outgoing to exchanges as well often when you're following one of the links you find small sums of Bitcoin that's been  periodically moved but now resting in accounts waiting for something who knows what one such example is this wallet that currently has 326 Bitcoin sitting in there which was moved one month ago February 16th 2024 just to show how active these wallets still are a day prior to that it was moved before and then before that on December 6th 2023 before that June 17th 2022 so as you can see it's years moving this Bitcoin over and over again waiting for something I wish I could answer why are the funds  still moving around I mean who knows but their investment has obviously paid off big time as this amount back when they initially moved all the funds would have been around $2 million in 2019 but today that 326 Bitcoin is worth approximately $ 225 million and I've just teased you with the small amounts because look at this one December 6th 2023 3 months ago this wallet was transferred 3,000 Bitcoin which today is worth about $24 million this money had previously been dormant in another wallet since August  of 2021 one of the largest exchanges going into an exchange you can find is February 22nd 2019 when 4,4 Bitcoin went to bit finex worth at the time $16 million I could keep going but hopefully you get the point trust me there's a lot more where this came from including some things I just couldn't show or explain without turning this video into something else entirely suffice to say this story is unique and it isn't over yet I've covered many different cryptocurrency hacks in my time and this one stood out as being interesting in  the way they tried to hide the initially hacked funds that part of the process worked incredibly well but there's something that doesn't make any sense to me at all usually hacked Bitcoin doesn't end up in exchanges because if law enforcement is looking they have the perfect paper trail to follow the money that's why things like crypto tumblers such as tornado cash exist to further loan the money to the point they're in fresh wallets with no connection to the initial funds breaking that onchain link  now let me give you the stats to put into perspective how massive this hack was when you value Bitcoin in today's numbers and why it's weird that nobody remembers this happened the amount of money that went through multiple wallets ended up being in the ballpark of around 14,000 Bitcoin which let's remember they took a 15% haircut on the initial 500 mil hack money as well as that cryptocurrency going down otherwise this number would have been much higher but 14,000 Bitcoin as I write this video is  around $980 million the initial amount stolen was already one of the biggest tax in history but if this money was just sitting around today it would make it one of the largest stolen funds in existence but let's remember much of these 14,000 Bitcoins were deposited to various centralized exchanges from 2018 onwards though as I've shown some large wallets are still visibly holding and moving Bitcoin in the hundreds of millions of dollars between wallets almost as we speak but more on this in a minute as with most aspects of the story  there's a Twist coming now let's look at those unlucky few as I mentioned earlier some people were held responsible for this hack or at least a part of it the greedy few who helped to initially money launder the N when it was stolen into clean Bitcoin well 30 of those were arrested by the Japanese police in 2021 in association with their purchase of those stolen goods these 30 men were found to have traded around $100 million worth of the cryptocurrency initially taken from the coin Check Exchange of  those 30 two of them were prolific and accounting for most of the trading as result of the Japanese police's investigation and arrests in this matter they concluded that around $400 or so million dollars of the funds were loed by overseas entities and thus Out Of Reach of the Japanese authorities meaning that of the $500 and something million doll initial hack value these arrests only accounted for less than 1/5th of the amount laundered leaving over $400 million of laed nem to have been profited from majorly from those  greedy few without any punishment for over 7 years in counting so with 30 Japanese citizens who briefly profited from the hack being small cogs in a greater machine that remains in operation the hackers remain thoroughly free and as shown by the recent Bitcoin wallet activity still actively moving the Otten gains but how is this even happening having seen how in-depth and easily the United States federal government finds larg scale hackers like this it's very hard for me to believe that the hackers will never be caught  especially since the onchain transactions are there to the very second with multiple exchanges being involved for me looking from the outside cryptocurrency exchanges act somewhat like a black hole or a money tumbler themselves meaning that when we see the money enter an exchange it's very likely the link is broken and we can no longer publicly see the transactions so when I said that the value of the bit coin if it was intact today would be $900 million it doesn't really matter if we saw large portions of it entering  exchanges and assuming it was sold out at the time but what if it wasn't what about if this time we could see where all the money went what about if all the Bitcoin was still there just entering exchanges on one end being filtered through dozens of accounts wallets exchanges and being sent to sit inactive somewhere else what if much of it was sitting on exchanges right now the majority is still there waiting to be looked at by anyone with the authority to do so with the potential to recover the stolen funds all these years later  and catch the people responsible for this forgotten hack or maybe waiting there for people to forget for the perfect moment to cash out on close to a billion dollars of stolen and loed Bitcoin making it one of the most perfect heists and crimes in history this could all be happening right now because it looks like people did forget until now what happens from here I can't say but at least you'll also remember and maybe somebody out there will watch where the Bitcoin goes next thanks for watching

that from the tiny country that is Israel the musant is feared and respected by the rest of the world and they mostly enforce that what makes this intelligence agency of the world's only Jewish state so highly regarded it might have something to do with that there is dangerous as they come and they stop for nothing for the Mossad there's no other way but  to accomplish the mission at all costs welcome to the Spy Network operation wrath of God also known as operation bayonet was a covert operation aimed to assassinate the ones responsible for the Munich Massacre in which 11 members of the Israeli Olympic team were killed it ignited an operation of a scale which the Mossad had never seen and this time it was more personal than ever the targets were Palestinians of the Armed militant group called blank September and operatives of the Palestinian Liberation Organization  rplo both of which are heavily motivated by the Israeli occupation of Palestine the operation is believed to have continued for over 20 years and is depicted in the movie Sword of Gideon and Steven Spielberg's movie Munich history two days after the 1972 Summer Olympics massacre in Munich Israel responded by striking 11 PLO positions in Syria and Lebanon prime minister goldamir established committee Acts a small group of government officials dance with developing an Israeli response led by herself and  defense minister Moshe Dayan she also named General aharun yariv as her Canter terrorism advisor he together with Mossad directors of isamir assumed the lead in coordinating the subsequent mission to discourage future violent acts against Israel the committee concluded that individuals who supported or carried out the Munich Massacre should be assassinated and in a dramatic fashion pressured by public outrage and intelligence officials the former prime minister launched a wide skill assassination campaign  against those who were responsible the committee's first test for Israeli intelligence was to throw up on an assassination list of all those involved in Munich this was done with some help from within mainly by PLO operatives that work for the Mossad and friendly intelligence agencies from Europe although the exact contents of this list are unknown is believed that there were between 20 and 35 people on it ranging from Pieology to Black September regions a critical component of this mission was  plausible deniability it should be in no way become apparent that there is a connection between the assassinations and Israel the Mossad hit squad the Musa Michael Harari was the head of the creation and direction of the teams is also speculated that the teams were not always operating under government Authority and responsibility to evade the possibility of tracing back to the Israeli government the Musa team had different squads whose names were letters derived from the Hebrew alphabet a left was the first team  and also the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet this team consisted of two trained Hitman bet was the second team and the second letter of the alphabet consisted of two operatives and guarded and Shadow the LF Squad hair or Hep was a third team this is the fifth letter of the alphabet and the steam of two agents was stance with covering for the aforementioned squads renting hotel rooms cars apartments and much more [Music] the seventh letter of the alphabet this team comprises of six to eight members  forming the backbone of the operation shadowing the targets establishing Escape Routes and gaining General Intel for that left and bad squads cough the 19th letter of the alphabet a squad of two people that took care of everything related to communication later on it was believed that a secret unit was in the Mossad the kidon was behind the assassinations the kedon is an elite unit whose primary responsibilities are planning and executing assassination campaigns against enemies of the Israeli state  the operations the first assassination occurred on October 16 1972 and Palestinian Wales writer was killed in Rome Ms White that was the PLO representative in Rome as claimed by the Israeli government the Piolo later stated that Wales whiter was in no way connected he was shot 12 times the second assassination Target was Mahmoud hamzari the PLO representative in France Israel stated that they believed him to be the Black September leader in France a Mossad agent posing as an Italian journalist with Lord Mahmoud out of his  apartment so that operatives could plant a bomb under his desk phone when the Italian journalist called back to mamu's apartment asking him to verify his identity it was signaled back to his team who could then send a detonation signal mortally wounding Mahmoud although not fatally wounded directly he was conscious long enough to tell detectives what happened he did not survive the attack passing away in the hospital several weeks later this was the first in a series of assassinations carried out in France  with the mosad three operatives in the list of the Mossad lived in heavily guarded houses in Lebanon this required a new level of sophistication because the previously used methods were of no use there a new mission was born dubbed as the operation spring of Youth sub-operation of the operation wrath of God on the night of the 9th of April 1973 several Israeli Commando squads landing on the coast of Lebanon they were welcomed by the Mossad agents who drove them to the premises of the targets the Commandos were dressed as  civilians some even disguised as women in Beirut they raided several guarded compounds in apartment buildings resignated what was believed to be highly ranked officers and officials from the PLO in Black September Ed this hunt for Ali Hassan Salome dubbed the red Prince he was presumed to be the chief of 417 and the Black September operator suspected by Israel of instigating the Munich tragedy this assumption has since been contradicted by testimonies from senior blessed September officials who claimed that one  Salome was involved in many attacks across Europe he had nothing to do with the Munich Massacre almost a full year after Munich Mossad believed they had finally located Salome in the small Norwegian town of lillyhammer on July 21 1973 when what would become known as the lillyhammer affair a team of Mossad agents shot and killed Ahmed bushike a Moroccan waiter unrelated to the Munich attack in Black September after an informant mistakenly identified bushiki asalome six massage agents including two women were arrested by  local police While others including the team leader Michael Harare managed to escape back to Israel five of the captured were convicted of a killing and imprisoned but were released and returned to Israel in 1975. although more assassinations had taken place these were the ones of which the most details were available the operation was a success and would ultimately be the biggest known operation of the Mossad in their history this was a look into the extremely covert and highly sophisticated operation of assassinations all part of  operation wrath of God thank you for watching and I'll see you all in the

I123	https://youtu.be/Ov1fQdxYIWI?si=rCNCb0aaI4KosIqE	hello my beautiful girls welcome in I am so so happy to have you with me today today we are talking about what it means to act feminine versus to actually be feminine so I'm going to teach you what performing femininity versus actually embodying beautiful divine feminine energy what is that difference there is a huge difference in femininity versus feminine energy what I truly believe and I've been studying feminine energy for about five years now to me femininity is the idea it is the appearance of what it  means to be feminine so these are things such as wearing pink wearing dresses being soft being super super accommodating being quiet and small that to me is the idea of being feminine versus actually being embodied in divine feminine energy that to me is Passion that is authenticity it is power it is being so radiant and full of this glow full of just this excitement for life it's having this energy field around you that other people feel and it's giving your vibration a huge increase that you can start to attract the life that you  want that is why when you notice when you're feeling good everything is going right in your life it's because you're in your feminine energy so there's a huge difference in performing what it means to be feminine versus actually being in your your phone and energy that's what we're going to talk about today everyone who's watching live welcome so happy that you are here let's go ahead and get started with Point number one so Point number one how to know the difference in performing versus actually  embodying so it comes down to your intention who are you trying to make happy if you are trying to make others happy that is performing femininity it's almost putting on a mask putting on an appearance for other people to be content and why we do this is because we want to seek validation from others it's because we're not truly embodied in that feminine energy that our source of approval has to come from someone else this is going to keep you locked in that state of performance guess what performance is it is masculine energy so  the way that I teach you need both masculine and feminine energy but your feminine energy being in it most of the time that's what's going to change your life that's what's going to give you that glow if you are constantly trying to seek approval from others and make other people happy your inner mode of masculine energy your feminine energy that's a gift of your creation energy your life force energy this is when you attract and you create and you just really bring that abundance to your life you want to be in your feminine energy  majority of the time let me say this two feminine and masculine energy it's not gender specific so it's your essence how you or what you resonate with most of the time for me personally I resonate with my feminine energy I love both masculine and feminine but my feminine energy I love being in it about 80 of the time so for me if I want to be my feminine energy I have to live from a place of being happy myself seeking approval from myself that is what it means to embody feminine energy so an example of this comes from a  question on a live stream two weeks ago that I did and one of you asked Alexis is it considered masculine to serve and my answer to you is who are you making Happy by surfing if it's someone else if it is an idea of Performing to make other people happy or proud of you or satisfied that is performing femininity it is not your true divine feminine energy other questions that I see all the time Alexis is it considered masculine to get tattoos is it considered masculine to do weight lifting or to go to the gym  ask yourself how do I feel when I do it am I making myself happy excuse me if you're going to get tattoos and you feel that it lights up your soul and it's just making you have this glow it just represents something that you love it has so much passion and purpose for you you are in your feminine energy and that is so so beautiful that is what you want to aim for it's the same thing with weight lifting so if you are weightlifting and it's making you happy you are in your feminine energy so that  when people ask is this sport feminine is this sport masculine the answer is how do you feel inside when you do it is it making you happy a close girlfriend of mine sometimes will go to the gym and work out together this girl is one of the strongest women I have ever ever met she can weight lift so much and she is so tiny but so strong she has this glow that just radiates in her whenever she is powerlifting she does CrossFit she loves going to the gym and when we're working out together and she's lifting  this heavy heavy weight I see this glow in her and it is the most beautiful thing she leaves the gym feeling so good and it's because she's been in her feminine energy so for you if you're at the gym and you feel oh this is so masculine to lift weights yes you are in your masculine energy because you're in your head versus being in your body that's a huge way to tell too if you are constantly thinking and using logic that is you in your head nothing wrong with that but that's the masculine energy  plays your feminine energy it's when you drop into your body it's when you connect to your soul and you feel how am I feeling on the inside so when you're at the gym lifting weights what I want you to do next time is think how am I feeling in my body when I do this I am becoming stronger I'm releasing endorphins and physically and mentally feeling better and I'm taking care of my body I'm in my feminine energy that is how you have that switch to go from performing to actually embodying feminine energy  and your feminine energy it will represent your happiness so I always say this a woman who is Happy is a woman who is in her feminine energy and it's again because you have that glow I always talk about that glow you just see it in women and they have it that's why I named my business the feminine glow because it represents that feminine energy essence you have this glow that radiates that is why women in their feminine energy they feel so good to be around it is why you feel so amazing when you are in your  feminine energy it is that glow and another Point here is when you are focused on making other people happy what happens is you become outward focused so it's almost you're living outside of your body and you can look at someone and tell if they're making themselves happy or trying to make someone else happy look in people who dance or who are going for a run the people who just they look like they're in their element and they're so happy they're so on fire with what they're doing they are in that feminine energy  mode and if you can tell that someone is trying to perform put on a show usually a sign of this is they are struggling when they do it that is that performing femininity again so you can look and tell if someone is genuinely happy or not okay Point number two does it genuinely align with your soul this is one of my favorite ones that we're going to talk about today so one of my clients this is a few months ago she was telling me Alexis I've really been trying to just relax and to get into a place after work where  I can be in my feminine energy and what she would do is she would go home and paint and she would paint for maybe an hour she told me I'm having trouble because I'm always inconsistent with painting I just can't seem to keep it up and I asked her does it genuinely align with your soul or are you doing it because it feels feminine and she told me I actually don't like painting I don't know why I do it so many of us do this there's things that our society has considered to be feminine but it does not align with our  soul at all and I can totally relate to her from me painting it almost feels like a chore and I see a lot of pictures on Pinterest of women painting and it looks so feminine but looking feminine is performing femininity it's not actually embodying divine feminine energy so my point here is do you actually feel that what you are doing aligns with your soul painting anything in the art field that is a huge one to consider and again with art there are so many parts to Art so art to me represents being flowy it represents creativity  represents freedom just letting your inspiration come to life artwork has so many forms it used to be so hard on myself why don't I enjoy doing art painting and drawing I used to when I was a kid but now as an adult I don't love doing it I would never sit down and do it and I realized I have a different form of art for me my form of art is cooking making beautiful nutritious meals it's being here on YouTube creating content and getting to teach and change the lives of women to me that is my artwork you have a form of art  that maybe you just haven't considered it art yet art is anything where you are in your creative flowing free inspired mode that is your artwork and that is you and your ultimate feminine energy [Music] lines with your soul it's actually you and your feminine energy two parts number one does it light you up when you do it so what I mean here is how does your body feel when you are doing it an example for me is when I'm figure skating I feel that my soul is on fire I just feel so lit up with excitement and I feel a  little nervous I feel a little scared but I feel so full of passion it just feels that the world has stopped almost and that I'm exactly in that moment that nothing else matters my soul is lit up another thing that I mentioned was creating content so being here on YouTube making tick tocks it feels that time stops and then I'm just in that zone and I leave feeling so good I just feel like I'm on a high that is what it means for your soul to be lit up so something that you can kind of um see is look at your past look at  pictures of you with you are a kid it's where everything all of the answers are in our childhood so for me when I look back at pictures I realize that as a kid I could tell what colors I liked wearing so when I was a when I was younger I loved the color turquoise I loved all colors of blue of green turquoise is my favorite color still to this day as you can tell I love the shades of blue when I was younger I felt I don't know how to describe this but I felt that I wasn't feminine I felt that I wasn't girly  because I didn't like pink and I know it's such a small thing to say but when I look at pictures of the eight-year-old version of me wearing pink versus wearing blue I can see the difference when I'm wearing pink my body looks stiff my face my eyes they don't look as happy versus when I'm wearing turquoise as a little girl in shades of blue and green it looks like I'm alive and you can see that glow to go back look at pictures of you what are the things that you would do as a kid the activities the colors that you  would wear the way that you would spend your time you can see what lights you up your inner child is still inside of you and for me now I love the color light pink you can probably see it on my nails but when I was younger I did not like pink and you can see when I would force myself to do it that I was performing that femininity there's a danger that comes with that and we'll get into that in a little bit but I want to make it so clear for you what the difference is so that you can transform your life for the  better because being in your feminine energy oh this could be a whole other video the main point about being near feminine energy it will change your life it will change your relationships it will change the way you feel about yourself it will change your habits the way that you look the way that you feel the way that you pursue your passions in your career it levels up everything that you are available for in life it connects you closer to your desires so your feminine energy it is the greatest gift that you  have you want to learn how to connect to it it has changed my life that's why I'm here because I want to help you change your life too another question that I see a lot is Alexis is it masculine to pursue my man and I go back and forth here but here's what I want to share with you if it lights up your soul do it that is your feminine energy something that I used to do is with my partner I would always think should I text him right now should I call him he was really on my heart but I would stay in my head and because of  that I was in my masculine energy I was on the fence what do I do I don't want to chase him he should be the one calling me that's not feminine energy that is me trying to perform femininity it was me trying to control the way that he saw me when I realized you know what that doesn't feel good for my body and I stopped performing started doing what felt good for me our relationship changed because I would do what was on my heart I would message him when he was on my heart I would not pursue him but I  would initiate even just romance I would initiate that between us when I felt good when it lit my soul up and it grew us closer it really improved our relationship so even when it comes to dating and relationships follow what is on your heart rather than trying to perform and trying to see am I chasing him and I am I performing do what feels good for your body that is your feminine energy okay so another part I said how to know if it aligns with your soul I said that there were two parts here the first one doesn't light you up when  you do it in the second part does it come easy to you so the choices that you make when you're in your feminine energy it comes easy to you it feels very smooth it feels very natural even with this business that I have now so I'm a feminine energy and inner work coach for those of you who are new here and I also create courses I have programs to guide you with everything I've learned from feminine energy I've put my heart and soul into these courses so that has felt very very easy for me to do creating this business that has  created more happiness more freedom with time more income than I could have ever ever imagined was easy it just felt very natural versus my previous businesses and my previous careers it felt like a struggle and it's because I was trying to perform it wasn't coming from a genuine place it wasn't easy to do you can tell if you're on the right path for your life if it feels excuse me you need to stop drinking kombucha during these live streams you can tell if you're on the right path if it's coming to you easily  if the pieces just seem to fall into place it was so amazing one of the amazing clients that I coach her name is wilda and we're having a session today and all of a sudden she goes Alexis this is a little off topic but she is a social media strategist and she goes Alexis you know how the Barbie movie is trending right now she says I really feel that you could do something with the Barbie with the Barbie Trend that's going on and she started pouring out all these marketing genius marketing ideas to me  and I was sitting there like trying to write down the notes that she was telling me but I was also just sitting there shocked thinking Willa you are just full of all these creative ideas this is you and your ultimate feminine energy they're just pouring out of her and her eyes her face it changed as she was telling me this so for me what was a struggle creating thumbnails and doing all the marketing even though I have a bachelor's degree in marketing for me it felt difficult and because of that  difficulty I would have created added thumbnails and ideas that weren't in line with my true passion and they wouldn't have been as beautiful and Brilliant as wildest ideas wilda's ideas came from a place of ease and flow and they are just so brilliant for my content I said wilda you are an amazing girl I need to share you with everyone in the world because it just flows from you so will does social media strategy company it is going to be so successful and she's already doing so well with it because it's coming from a genuine place  number one it lights her up when she does it number two it's easy for her I'm gonna put all of her business description her Instagram in the description if you're watching this on YouTube her Instagram is kissed by a siren she is brilliant so amazing but I want to use that example to show you if it's easy and if it feels good for you there is something there all of the women that I work with in my programs that I coach the ones who are entrepreneurs and content creators everything that they create has come  from a place of ease and flow and it lines up with something that they're passionate about if you are there if you know what you're passionate about and if it's easy for you to brainstorm there is something there whether it's creating content creating a business anything and that kind of leads me to my next point so there's no such thing as a masculine job a lot of women will ask well Alexis can I still be in my feminine energy I'm an engineer one of my clients is a very very amazing brilliant engineer she is one of the  most feminine women I have ever ever met I wish I could bring her on this live stream for you guys to meet but she just every time I meet with her she just glows she just has this presence that's so light that you just want to sit with her you just want to be around her she's so fun and free-flowing and it's like she has this beautiful gold bubble around her so it doesn't matter what job you have it matters are you following your heart are you in a place of feeling good I work with a lot of women who are top  level Executives and CEOs and creators of companies and business owners those to the world are considered masculine jobs because they're in positions of leadership but these are some of the most feminine women that I know and it's because they're at their jobs they're actively doing inner work and they're just having fun in life it's their perspective it's the way that they carry themselves the way that they feel about themselves their habits in and out of work that's what puts you in your feminine energy not the actual job that  you're in that's why I notice with the women who take my become a Dream Woman and master your feminine energy program so many of them will write to me and say Alexis after doing your course I have had a career shift I have had a new idea of where I want to take my content creation or of a new business that I want to create I feel so empowered and excited to start this new chapter and it's because they've gotten aligned to their feminine energy and it's now guiding them where they should go with their  careers so it's not actually about what you're doing it's how you feel when you're doing it no matter your job maybe I'll make a whole other video about that because that could be interesting talking about the workplace more okay this is part three this is the last part and then I will take some of your girls's questions okay so performing femininity versus embodying feminine energy how do you feel about looking the part by looking the part I mean the way that you dress the way that you carry yourself overall your appearance and the  way that you present yourself so like I said in the beginning femininity is outward focused it is caring so much on your appearance but it's lacking the true feminine energy inside embodying feminine energy it's carrying that feminine energy inside and it's also being reflected on the outside so when it comes to performing femininity some examples that I see a lot of women do and I'm so guilty of this myself too it's things such as wearing dresses wearing makeup wearing heels acting acting soft acting quiet when that's not  really Who You Are dressing in a way speaking in a way acting in a way that's not who you actually are it doesn't hold this the same power as actually being in your feminine energy so an example to show you this there is this dress that I've owned for years it's a simple dress from h m and when I first got this dress I was not fully embodied in my feminine energy the way that I am now when I would wear this dress it felt uncomfortable it's a beautiful flowy orange dress it's in my video summer glow up guide It's that  bright orange one that I'm wearing if you want to see it and when I wore it I felt yes that I looked feminine but I did not feel feminine and I still continued to wear it and wear it and then one day I just kind of put it back in my closet and said okay I'm not really feeling this dress anymore as I continue doing inner work and healing my own feminine energy really connecting deeper to it that dress started to stand out to me more and more one day I put it on I swear my girls it fit differently I swear it was  a different dress the way that it sat on my body was even different my family my friend started saying oh Alexis when did you get this dress it looks so great on you it was the same dress different woman wearing it I was completely different so it doesn't matter what you're wearing it doesn't matter what your appearance is if you are not fully embodied in that feminine energy it does not matter all the way that you are on the inside that is what matters so something else here too is what I used to do is I used to only know how to  be in my light feminine energy and I've talked about this in a lot of other videos the quick backstory the way that I grew up it was I had a parent who was very very strict and I did not feel safe in my home growing up so because of this I was taught to people please I was taught how to have weak boundaries and I was taught never to stand up for myself that put me in a place to be extremely comfortable with my light feminine energy but so scared to use my dark feminine energy your light and dark feminine energy the  light feminine energy this is about Radiance it's about warmth love happiness the dark feminine energy it's more of that power more of that confidence it's that mysteriousness it's the seductiveness excuse me it's standing up speaking your mind being direct with the power behind it both your light and dark feminine energy beautiful beautiful you need both but because of the way that I grew up my dark feminine energy was so repressed it was stuck in my body I kept stuffing it down because if I brought it out if I  spoke my mind if I was more um just seductive or confident and even my sexuality I was shamed so I kept it hidden then when I was older and an adult I did a lot in her work to bring out that dark feminine energy to feel safe to feel confident with it now I feel so good with my dark feminine energy now I love both the light and the dark and I'm balanced the balance that's going to bring you to your divine feminine energy but what I was saying here was when I was in the light feminine energy I was  in the acting feminine I was in the performance femininity role and it's because I was almost wearing a mask and trying to play a role of being the nice girl of being the one that was always liked being the one that was always very pleasant to be around and because of that I was not in my true feminine energy there was a part of me that was being stuffed down so it's not just the way that you dress it's also the way that you act are you showing all parts of yourself are you living from the most  free the most authentic the most raw and true version of yourself that is you embodying your feminine energy and I understand I see this a lot that many women they live with maybe a husband who's very controlling or family maybe even your parents are still controlling so it's hard to be yourself I completely understand that what I recommend for you give yourself a safe place where you can be free whether it's going to a dance class and being with other women who support you to just move your body let out the light or the dark  feminine energy whether it's your bedroom if you live at home there that you know you just can take off the mask you can be free you can be yourself maybe it's with your friends maybe it's in a relationship give yourself a safe place to show up a hundred percent authentically that is going to take you to your feminine energy and I'm so sorry girls I need to keep drinking this my throat has been so dry the past few days I live in Las Vegas and it's really really dry here feminine energy this is the quote that I always say  look good feel good do good what this means with your feminine energy you almost work backwards so when you think about that end result of doing good by doing good it means being aligned with your purpose and your passion having a life that feels good with that you go backwards so what good feel good do good to do good you have to feel good to feel good you want to look good and what I mean here is you want to get to a place where you are caring and loving for yourself so much that you put yourself together the way that you dress  the way that you care for your skin for your mind for your body I know that I say it's inward Focus but your outward appearance it does play a role too I recommend that you check out my video why looks matter and it's not about the looks it's about the way that you're caring for your body is represented by your looks so if you take the time to actually care for your body love your body and this is done through inner work it will automatically be reflected in your outer appearance that is why I say  when you actually become feminine and you embody your feminine energy your outward appearance starts to change naturally you start dressing different you will start treating other people differently even speaking differently the girls in my program so many girls have written to me and said Alexis my voice is different after doing your become your dream woman program the way that I speak is different it's so crazy it's because there's been an internal shift in them where they have truly embodied feminine energy and their voice  communicates that shift it communicates that new woman that they are it communicates their new thought patterns and beliefs about themselves that's why with the dress example the reason that I even wore that orange dress again was because I decided I want to feel good I want to do good for me to feel good I have to feel free I have to feel that I can flow wearing jeans is not going to get me there but wearing a dress that is going to help me feel like I'm flowing so that's why when you actually embody  your feminine energy everything around you starts to change another change that I notice and this one I always get a lot of pushback with but I believe when you are truly embodied in your feminine energy you dress more modestly what I mean here is you don't reveal everything you don't reveal all of the intimate Parts about you it's dressing in a way that is protecting your Sexual Energy so I firmly believe that when you are revealing everything maybe you're revealing a lot of cleavage or wearing a  super super short dress if men are looking at you I believe that they are absorbing your energy when they are seeing your body they're taking your energy so when you start to shift into your divine feminine energy you realize how valuable it is it becomes so sacred to you that you want to protect it so naturally you're going to wear clothes that are less revealing so that people cannot take your energy by looking at you you can feel it when someone's eyes are on you if you dress classy you are protecting your energy my girls and my  course you know how much you have to protect your Sexual Energy it is your gift it is your life force energy when it's being used in the in the way that's not the most powerful it's going to take away a lot of your potential you want to keep it safe you want to protect love and honor your body so this is to show again that there's a lot of natural changes that happen when you shift into your feminine energy I see a comment this is a word yes thank you Okay so another part of this too is when I had a lot of skin issues so I  used to have acne oh my gosh I had acne for like five years and it was really bad and I felt so insecure I felt that my worth was so low I would just not want to be seen I wouldn't want to go out because I didn't want people to see my face I'd break out all of my cheeks my forehead I did not feel good what I had to do was realize my desire is to feel good my desire is to feel confident I want to feel good I want to feel radiant and naturally I was led to focus on my gut health I was led to focus on how to clean out my body  naturally if I did not stop and say I desire to feel confident I desire to have clear skin I would never have been led to work on my gut health or to really have a natural approach to health that I do now so when you are so in line with your desire of how you want to feel number one you're in your feminine energy and number two naturally the idea is to get there they will open for you so that's why too when you're in your feminine energy you feel more inspired to dress up to go to the gym to feed your body  with healthy nutritious Foods it's because you desire to look good to feel good to do good another question that I see a lot is Alexis how can I be inspired to put myself together daily my answer is do the inner work that is going to raise your level of self-worth that is going to raise your level of self-love because when you love your body naturally putting yourself together and creating an appearance that makes you feel so confident makes you feel so good about yourself that will come you feel so  worthy to take care of yourself to take care of your body that is how you do it something that I love love talking about is your energetic Beauty and what I love so many of you girls you've taken this quote and you've posted it all over your Instagram that I say no physical Beauty can ever outshine your energetic Beauty no physical feature can ever outshine your energetic Beauty so that means no body type no Style no hair color no body part can ever outshine you when you are glowing with feminine energy  I see a lot of questions of girls saying Alexis this woman is just so beautiful or I love this part of her body I love this part of her looks that will never outshine your energetic Beauty you have this glow that cannot be matched so take that internal glow and build it to be the best that it can be fully connect to and embody your feminine energy and then you won't ever feel that you have to compare yourself to anyone else then you won't ever feel that someone else's physical feature can take away from you  your energetic Beauty it is unique build upon that because that is the strongest gift that you have and the key to embodying feminine energy versus actually just performing it it is doing inner work in our work I swear it is a key for everything I call Inner work personal development for the soul in my master your feminine energy and become your dream woman course maybe 90 of the course is about inner work it's a soul level guidance to shift you and to help reprogram your mind to actually carry yourself and believe and have  different thoughts have different beliefs so that you can become that elevated version of yourself I also have a free YouTube video called inner work guy that will really really help you with your inner work Journey all right let me take some of your girls's questions I'm so excited to chat with you I also wanted to announce too that a firm is now available for my course this is a program that allows you to pay for the course over time if you don't want to pay for it all up front so a firm is now available also my girls  will you let me know if any of you who have joined the course using PayPal does PayPal give you the option to pay over time or is it just up front someone told me that you could pay overtime but I want to definitely double check all right my girls let's chat for a bit okay oh how can I maintain my feminine energy when I'm living kind of in survival mode yes oh this is so good so it's very very difficult to be in your feminine energy when you're living in survival mode and if you aren't familiar  with survival mode here's how I describe it imagine that you are running through the forest and a lion is chasing you when this line is chasing you what happens is all of the non-essential functions in your body they shut down because your focus right now is to survive it is to outrun that lion so your immune system will shut down your nervous system will shut down your digestive system will shut down and so many more other functions what happens nowadays is so many of us experience trauma and it has shifted us into that  survival mode state of trying to outrun that lion so then what happens is our immune system is shut down how can our body fight cancer our nervous system is shut down how can our body relax and de-stress our digestive system has shut down how can our body digest food and have good gut health how can we have a clear mind how can we have a healthy body healthy skin we can't so all these issues of skin issues and diseases and anxiety depression always feeling in a rush always having a to-do list always  stressed most people are in survival mode and they don't know it they are energetically still outrunning this lion so what you have to do is you have to heal you have to shift out of that survival mode to fully be in your feminine energy it's nearly impossible to be in your feminine energy and trying to outrun danger at the same time because one of the cores of feminine energy is safety it's feeling rested and relaxed so that you can get into that high vibrational State and create so what I would advise for you if you  are in survival mode is I would I would imagine I think I've told you this in another video I tell this all my clients imagine that you have a dial that little circle that you use to control volume on devices so imagine that you have a dial that's sitting right here on your chest what I want you to do turn down that dial by 15 imagine that the speed that you move throughout the day the way you talk eat um Drive imagine that you're turning down your speed by 15 this is going to help you heal out of survival mode  because you're teaching your body to be relaxed something else I would advise you to do is to do something where you are moving your body whether this is dancing whether it's hip opening exercises yoga when you are moving your body you are releasing the blocked emotion out of your hips out of your body blocked emotion is stored trauma most people have story trauma until they have done the work to release it let's say that you had parents who were constantly yelling and screaming at each other all  of that trauma that you experienced physically stored in your body from when you were a kid so now when you are around someone who's also screaming and yelling you feel that trauma activated it hurts you it pulls you down what you have to do is release you have to move your body to release that trauma that way when someone is doing something that reminds you of your parents reminds you of that trauma you're not triggered anymore you're in that relaxed state that sore trauma is no longer holding  you down I also have a YouTube video called I think it's called get out of survival mode definitely watch that girl watch that video that is one of the best videos on how to heal survival mode if you are in it and my girl if you are in my program and I think lesson one or two I go deep into how to heal survival mode how to reprogram your mind out of it definitely go back and revisit that lesson hmm I feel emotionally unsafe with my boyfriend of two years any advice yeah so if you feel emotionally unsafe  I'm curious is it something that he is doing or is it a way that your body is feeling regardless of him so Leslie if you wouldn't mind girl putting in the comments what is it that's causing you to feel unsafe because I so with my partner I felt my very very first relationship I felt so unsafe with my partner because I had an anxious attachment style because I had unhealed trauma so every time he would take a while to text back or he wouldn't answer my phone call I felt emotionally unsafe with him it wasn't his actions it  was my unhealed trauma because I had a parent who was very narcissistic very hot and cold I had an abandonment wound I had to heal that abandonment wound and then naturally I began to feel safer with my partner something that's so fascinating too is when you are attracting a partner you're attracting someone who's going to pull out that unhealed trauma in you so I would if I were you Leslie I would write down the areas that you're feeling unsafe with your boyfriend see if it's something that he's doing or  see if there's actually a deeper root there of some sort of unhealed trauma that he's actually just mirroring back to you do you have any books I love your advice and videos yes thank you so much for my book recommendations oh I have so many so I'm gonna tell you the top books that I've read this year so far number one is the Power of Now that book oh it's by Eckhart Tolle I think I'm saying his name right that book is just all about inner work how to actually step outside of yourself and look at the way that you show up look at  the way that your mind is programmed look at the way that your soul is lit up where your passions and your purpose are and how to see where you are not living in your full potential in life yet and how to get there that book is so good it's more on the spiritual side so if those types of books are harder to read I would maybe get an audio book of The Power of Now but it is so good it's about being present just really being connected to your body I also really really love the book ask and you will receive and I think that's  by Esther and Jerry Hicks so they talk about how to become aligned with the higher vibrational version of yourself how to create the feelings where you get to that place and you're just feeling good and you have a very positive outlook on your life it's a book all about the law of attraction how to attract your desires that book is really awesome one of the best books that I've ever read of my life is called you are a badass It Is by Jen sincero that book is so powerful this is the ultimate self-love book so  if you're struggling with low self-worth and a lack of self-love definitely look into the book you're a badass it is so good I also if you're in my course go to the part where I give you my my PDF of all of the books that I've ever read and all of the books that I recommend you read there's so many incredible books that have changed my life that are on that list I do not think I'd be here on YouTube or I don't think I would be a coach or creating courses if it were not for the books that I've read they have  changed my life the way that I see reading it's absorbing someone's whole entire life of wisdom and knowledge and they're giving it to you so I love reading I think there's so much value in books those are a few that I recommend ask and it is given yes I hope I said the name right in the beginning okay I love that book yes so what Melissa says what do you do about insecurities does insecurities bring you out of feminine energy yes insecurity shifts you out of feminine energy because feminine energy thrives on  safety security confidence and self-love so what I personally did about insecurities so for me a huge insecurity was my skin I hated when I had so many breakouts I just felt so unconfident and I decided I have to do something about this nobody is going to come in and make me feel secure and there's two parts here one I actually wanted to physically do something to help me feel better about that insecurity what I did is I took control of my gut health I also went on Accutane years back I did something to help me feel better from  the insecurity number two is I would step outside of myself and look at myself from a future version so I would think on the 90 year old version of myself looking back at the 16 year old version of me and I would think Alexis you are missing out on Amazing nights out with your friend you are missing out on possible relationships possible opportunities because you are so focused on your skin and I had to almost shake myself and say wake up stop focusing on your insecurities unless you want other  people to focus on them too and I realized this when I was crying to my mom one day and just telling her oh I'm so frustrated with my breakouts mom and she says Alexa so that's the first thing that you notice about yourself other people will too then I realized I need to stop being so in the victim mindset so insecure about something so small unless I wanted other people to mirror that back to you even for example with YouTube when I was first starting off with YouTube I wasn't 100 about it so my energy was very  nervous very shaky it wasn't the most secure about it and people mirrored that back to me and this even happened with Tick Tock too I almost wanted to not be seen by my friends and family and I would hear my friends not friends but my co-workers say comments such as Alexis I keep seeing your Tick Tock videos pop up that's so funny and then one day I realized you know what they're marrying back something in me that's not fully secure with this so whatever it is that you are insecure about shift to a place where you are just so  secure about it where you almost become delusional what I did in that moment is I said if I was delusionally confident about the way that I post on Tick Tock how would I respond to this co-worker and what I did was oh my gosh that's so cool what videos did you see and then something shifted at me I started to become secure about Tick Tock and then it blew up and then it took off and it has changed my life I quit that job because Tick Tock took off so much so anything that you are insecure about  I know that this is a long answer but I want you to number one see if you can do something about it it's so easy to stay stuck in the victim mindset and two shift your perspective the highest the most radiant confident version of you how would she act how would she feel about that insecurity same thing with my smile I started smiling more people complimented my smile more yes MK that's a beautiful example I love it I gotta start I gotta start ignoring my big old forehead shaking my head yes girl if  you're thinking about your forehead being so big guess where you're going to see people's eyes being focused on your forehead so we love to be in the victim mindset sometimes I'm so guilty of this and focus on our flaws but they're only flaws if you feel that they are a flaws having I used to feel that I had a big head too and I remember someone in my family used to always tease me about this and then one day I started responding yeah it has to hold my brain with all of this Brilliance and knowledge they stopped making that  comment so shift it to be a blessing rather than an insecurity can you answer these questions faster no because the way that I'm answering questions is coming from the most authentic the most real way that I feel is best to answer so what you can do is you can go ahead and speed this up if you're listening on YouTube but I'm not going to answer the questions faster I go on these live streams so that I can do one-on-one time with the girls that I cannot coach and I want to give in-depth answers I genuinely believe in sharing  this content and I know that there's so much value in it I'm gonna add my forehead is an average size to my morning affirmations girls yes you're so right lol all pretty girls have big foreheads yes I love you Alexis oh Serena my beautiful girl so nice to see you in here I love you too I love the way that you're answering thank you for taking your time MK yes thank you girl you are so welcome I love your in-depth answers so much more helpful Tiffany yes thank you my girls that's the thing is I do not take  advice from comments on the live stream like that because I always see comments Alexis talk faster Alexis talk slower no I'm going to speak the way that feels best for me because that is me and my feminine energy and I've seen the changes in so many women's life that have come from the way that I've been delivering content I'm not going to change it unless I actually feel in my body it's right to change so thank you my girls no it's a full sentence yes okay my girls oh I am so sad I have to go now I've Loved loved live streaming  with you thank you so much for being here and your amazing energy and your questions I cannot wait to see you next week have a beautiful rest of your day bye 	Center			Center	92
I130	https://youtu.be/am3nEz7JcvQ?si=WZ85b9A29MXD5muO	those people in North Carolina those are incredible people those are incredible Patriots you want freedom take pride in your country love your nation the future does not belong to globalists the Future belongs to Patriots so we went to the people to find out just how patriotic these Patriots are we sent a crew to a trump rally in South Carolina to give those gathered there a simple citizenship test the same ones immigrants are required to take and this is what happens when the citizenship hits the fan number one what  is the supreme law of the land no guns liberty and justice what you just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever heard how many amendments does the Constitution have 32 32 10 no I don't know 20 something I think maybe 13 I'm not really sure on that I worry about number one and number two at no point in your rambling incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought as an immigrant in the process of obtaining citizenship I want to say  this does not surprise me he could stand on the front steps of the White House and and commit murder and I'm with him if he says it then I'll go with it and if he wants to be a dictator then so be it having had to sift through endless hate filled comments over the many years years I've spent covering us politics from self-described Patriots with opposing political views I've always wondered how they'd Faire if actually questioned on the very subjects they claim to know and love so dearly would they be able to recite the Pledge of  Allegiance backwards to the tune of America the gr or would they scramble like Trump trying to remember a single Bible passage he's a God-fearing man remember okay you mentioned the Bible you've been talking about how it's your favorite book and you said I think last night in Iowa some people are surprised that you say that I'm wondering what one or two of your most favorite Bible uh verses are why I wouldn't want to get into it because to me that's very personal you know when I talk about the Bible is very personal so I don't want  to get into vers I don't want to get into there's no verse that means a lot to you that you think about or sight the Bible means a lot to me but I don't want to get into specifics even to cite a verse that you like no I don't want to do that an Old Testament guy or a new testament guy uh probably equal well during a follow-up segment on Jimmy Kimmel not only did he speak on the matter of how Trump simply can't let go of the fact that he was laughed at by a room of celebrities which you know has  been chewing away at his ego daily uh we have both been immortalized um on social media by our former president Donald Trump has there ever been a worse host than Jimmy Kimmel at the Oscar his opening was that of a less than average person trying too hard to be something which he is not and never can be get rid of Kimmel and perhaps replace him with another washed up but cheap ABC Talent George SLO anopolis he would make everybody on stage look bigger stronger and more glamorous blah blah blah make America great  again okay now see if you can guess which former president just posted that on TR to the former president is that true do you have to use a teleprompter when speaking about President Trump or are you able to um just kind of Riff on what on your thoughts on him yeah I he he's so stupid Kimmel then took the fight to the streets and opted to put the magga Patriots to the test what brings yall here today see Donald Trump himself Donald Trump trump baby Trump trump yeah let's give a good look at the sweatshirt  and the fanny pack yeah he sent out one of his colleagues to ask them simple questions found in the US citizenship test we're out here today asking Real Americans if they could pass the citizenship test do you think you could do it sure maybe easily and the results were let's just say it's no surprise that Trump's followers believe him when he claims things like you need ID to buy bread number one what is the supreme law of the land no guns liberty and justice wow I have no idea we might fell yeah  good question well I couldn't answer that one right now how many amendments does the Constitution have 32 32 10 no I don't know I'm shocked shocked well not that shocked crazy thing is having studied for said test these are by far and way some of the easier questions 20 something I think maybe 13 I'm not really sure on that I worry about number one and number two what are the first three words of the Constitution Liberty and happiness and this just reaffirms the frustration that I have when I discuss the subject  of immigration with those who don't quite understand the entire process but it's an extensive process involving yes tests like such tests that Studies have shown only one in three Americans would actually pass I'm not here to scrutinize people for not knowing every crevice of US history but not everyone parades the word Patriot around like Trump supporters they think because they clad themselves in red white and blue that they are more American than anyone else no Donald Trump you know I mean that's  the thing is people you know I have his phone number in my phone book he was he was the guy that came to the bars and and asked me about which which cocktail waitress was single you know that's who he was this is back in the 90s not that no back in the 2000s quite honestly and uh and so there there's this part of you that just goes well that guy shouldn't be president but I was wrong and he was and uh and our uh democracy I believe paid the price certainly around they're pressed on simple question like what are  the first three words of the Constitution struggling with the three part more so than the actual Constitution what are the first three words of the Constitution In God We Trust okay so that's four sing the national anthem for me oh say can you see by the dawn's early light so proudly we s Twilight and bright stars and the the what it's the perilous guys so close you guys that was so close not to forget that this is also the same Constitution they'd happily set a light if it meant appeasing the dictator that they want so bad they're  looking for the people that rigged the election and that's the people they go after they got away with something they're never going to get away with it again look what they've done to the country then you look at January 6 it was a rig election and we're looking at it and almost everybody in this room agree it was a rigged election but we won much bigger with millions and millions more votes in 2020 it was a rigged election it was a rigged election they go after the guys that complain about the election not the  guys that rigged the election isn't that interesting right I only want to be a dictator for one day just so you know that is how it starts because nothing is more patriotic than authoritarianism right I'd rather have Donald Trump as a dictator for four years absolutely this country needs a dictator I hate to say that but it's the truth he could stand on the front steps of the White House and and commit murder and I'm with him if he says it then I'll go with it and if he wants to be a dictator then so be it and as John  Stewart put it so perfectly it's all performative they're not patriotic they are partial to a con man Patriots festooned in American flags Co signing dictatorship remember we the people you know there's more words after that right smaller font still binding look if you want to love Trump love him go to the rallies buy the sneakers you want to give them Absolute Power you want them to be the leader Uber Alis you want them to have the right of kings you do you but stop framing it as patriotism love  this video make sure you stay up toate on the latest breaking news and all things midest by signing up to the midest touch

had it you know what I mean so even right now she slipped out  of the cuffs and charged again oh no was going to happen I don't want her to be obious like picking because I did we the officer originally put the cups on to hold her she was she she not because she was already Ling at the principal so she became a threat to the people and that small are I'm but so the office in which the principal is is smaller than this I know that but can my daughter come on with me right now excuse me can my daugh come on with me right now right now we're filling out the paperwork she has being

with our people we're going to turn over to you but why you you have to be in there everybody's in there staggering because we contacted you an OP probation officer so if they were willing to detain her and take her to the jail detain her why because batter School  Personnel is a felony it's a felony yes soon as you make contact with a rude incident or angry manner to another individual the school staff even if I just slapped your hand it's a felony yes okay so that's a felony for a child even for a child then you then she resisted okay cuz she was well she was kicking and pulling well she she slipped out of the Cuffs right now right now as we speak where my daughter she's sitting on the chair now okay and you have her handcuff yes but handcuff for why I mean  because she's already expressed expressing to do something more I'm willing to remove my daughter um so how more Pap going to take place I give us another at least 20 20 minutes 20 why you're going to have my daughter hand for 20 minutes yeah cuz you little too tight and you loosen it too much now so like he's been a police officer for like how long and he still doesn't know how the to put on a handcuff or what 74 that's got are real the mother became defensive and attempted to justify her daughter's actions they're  not even tight yes you understand listen to me your your your definition of the safety is not as same as ours so we un handcuff her and she lunges and hits a principal or staff so keep her handcuffed out out of the building once we release her to you she's on handcuffs and you take her okay okay but as long as she's in our custody she's can I go back to them while you do not yet there's not enough room there's so many people why is everybody in there though because she's acting not the way she is  I know you just have to be in the officer come onc everybody does not have to be there she got citation we have two security guards in there two female security guards okay we had the principal and assistant principal and the officer okay that's how many people are in there in that small room or people on yes they're not on her they're not touching why so by I need to get out think do you think you give a you don't so you know that so I know what you know that I don't care no I don't give a either you give  a don't they're all but they're all verbally like to wrong not she's the one that's more verbal than anybody else she's cussing and making just calling people names and everything she yeah so she she's saying she's calling people hoto she's calling this m no no I understand that's that's the minimal that's not the language I know she's just calling she can get very biger it's hard to comment she's derogatory name she's using it all okay so her demeanor itself I don't live with her so I don't know if that's her normal  demeanor no but she's acting out and that she's a student that's why I said I have never had a problem with at this point in time I don't know why she's acting out that way but she is okay and due to the safety restrictions we're going to detain her she's detained now and she's been charged soon as we're done with paperwork and everything she has Poss is going to get suspended obviously from the school I'm going to from the school but she's going to get turned over back I'm sorry she is going to get turned over when we're

don't know who I thought Mr Lloyd was his supervisor see it's all mixed we don't have a Lloyd there's a different thing you're saying jump like they're just standing there because they're all physically abusing her and they're all like nobody's physically doing anything to her cuz my daughter does not rect that I  nobody's touching her if my daughter was like nobody is touching nobody's touching I'm going to give your mom a copy anyway she wasn't going to fight her you're dumb that's not what happened squaring off you what happened H it's remember listen it's not your perception if she felt that way that's what she felt no that's not what she felt that's not what happened she might be thinking that in her then that's her but that's her I know I could tell that's her okay but if she's but like my my part is going to be  different or what your part what do you mean like what how much parts are going to be cuz like I can see a lot of documents there's three charges there's three charges what kind of charges okay you're looking battering a school Personnel you're looking resisting and the alcohol that's a lot home that's bad home when you're old good huh well the one with the teacher the school Personnel that's a felony oh that's stupid but nothing happen with the teacher it doesn't have to happen you don't have to injure somebody it just  has to be do as long as you touch that person I didn't even touch that person she touched my phone I my phone no I had my phone in my hand and she reached for my phone and and she kept trying to reach for my phone I no it in my position you had it right there on the desk but then at one point did she have it with her no she it was laying on the desk like that and I was like let me see my phone and I grab my phone I my hand and she goes to reach and then she kind of getting my finger off and then afterward the stuff is  stuff you can explain okay all the stuff is what you can explain later yeah I mean but right now that's what it is update for Mom I just is my mom still out there yeah she's waiting outside I'm just she's waiting wait but why am I waiting here if you guys are still do I need to print that form out so your mom can sign it cuz you're going to go with your mom the female continued to complain about the handcuffs so when the are you guys going to take these off are you guys so you guys have to keep on the whole time youed look how  loose they are you act like they're tight no bro they're tight at first and they're still on here and it's still affecting are you or what guess all you guys are huh they're not intended for you to be keep moving around oh they're not intended to be on me where are they intended to be on on why you're asking questions that you don't want to you okay what she talk about stupid cool start cussing out like and what about it hey where the my phone for real hey get my phone your mom's not in the building no IU  about hey when are you going to get my phone I'm going to give it to your mom when we release your tour oh why you just give it to her right now or when she you see her or whatever the yeah yeah you should have raed that like what the are you holding on to my phone that now there're still gossiping there's other stuff going on besides you oh really you think I give a I'm not talking about you okay shut up who you no don't give a Fu about you shut hallway I don't my ears okay do you guys have ears  I go you're right it's not that important if you don't care then don't ask the question shut up okay my eyebrows you guys take a long ass I swear what the you guys trying to do take all D no not trying to take any more time than we need to just I bet you guys taking your time for sure that's all you press yes it's  finally hey what the to my computer your mom has it are you sure yes finally don't shut up see you again go this is what she had later the female's mother called the police department to file a complaint  about the officer's Behavior this officer he threw my daughter on the ground and my daughter's a miner okay I think that's battery to me okay okay so obviously um there has to be reason that any kind of Officer uses force and what about a camera should yeah yep is he supposed to have the camera on at all times miners yes correct yes most definitely most definitely also and I'm regarding an incident that happened on March the 7th on Tuesday at Sierra Middle School okay the things that he did was appropriate  you know getting my daughter on the headlock thr on the ground and having all these other Securities like get on top of my daughter one of them was even sitting on top of my daughter okay and I want to know um cuz I'm sure it' be any else's kid and somebody says hey this person threw me down somebody hits me I because they threw me on the ground and I thought was only 13 the officer threw me on the ground I bang my head and Sh my knees and then he he continued to put his knee on my hair and then he started  getting me a handcuffs or trying to okay and then he had me like down face first and then afterwards all the three security guards started attacking me okay I want to um a charge on that officer for battering my daughter cuz he has no right regardless of what they're trained nobody has a right to throw anybody on the ground and have a bang their head and keep their head their leg press on their on their head for what okay what's the reason dirty handup why you got to do all that I can I can definitely put  myself in your shoes there I'm a mom as well and I would definitely want to make sure that anything that occurred was proper does that make sense and yes another thing that was very startling to me was that the school people they never called me I had a call from my daughter and then they had her in another extra room like when I got there and they were refusing like for me to see my daughter and they were refusing my you know my daughter kept asking for me and they were refusing the female was charged  with battery on a school Personnel resisting in minor in possession of alcohol YouTube thinks you'll love the video on screen click to watch watch now

I222	https://youtu.be/M-CrgaKOKUI?si=TyfeTjTVUjJcz_wK	the house has passed the Israel Ukraine Taiwan Aid package basically um and when the when Mike Johnson as Speaker of the House basically uh voted to avert a government shutdown a few weeks ago a few months ago Marjorie Taylor green had filed a motion to vacate him which is what happened with Kevin McCarthy Kevin McCarthy was successfully vacated it vacated led by Matt Gates and Nancy mace and some others um but Marjorie Taylor green did this in retaliation for basically him doing any budget deal with the  Democratic Senate and the Democratic president he she he was punished for governing but it's this kind of delayed punishment that's been hanging over Mike Johnson's head and she's been extraordinarily uh basically dogmatic in her opposition to Ukraine funding it's that's a democratic priority the de the Ukraine funding in the house passed with every single Democratic vote so she is standing in opposition to it but when she filed that motion to vacate Mike Johnson she did not prioritize it so there's still a  question as to whether they're going to be able to do it or if they'll move forward with it she has this looming threat and she went on Maria bomo show on Sunday to expand on what she might do next As It Go uh as it relates to Mike Johnson's uh speakership welcome back and I am back with Georgia congresswoman margorie Taylor green okay congresswoman you wanted Mike Johnson out what is your alternative plan our plan is this is we have to give the American people a reason to trust us and fight for us the American people are  supporting president Trump to be the next president of the United States because they saw they've seen him in action he fought against the Democrat agenda he put America first they desperately want him to lead this country again because they trust him and they know he will do that Mike Johnson has betrayed America he's be betrayed Republican voters under his leadership he's passed the Democrat agenda passed the Biden administration's policies and fully funded them we're going to fight in Congress to do everything we can to  stop this type of uni party leadership Mike Johnson's speakership is over he needs to do the right thing to resign and allow us to move forward in a controlled process if he doesn't do so he will be vacated well with all du respect you didn't give me a plan for the speaker's role and again does this mean you are going to file that motion at some point it's coming uh regardless of what Mike Johnson decides to do and we have three more Republicans joining us from special elections coming up very soon so  people need to know this can happen playing her off that's hilarious um so the problem with marg's plan here is that you have Democrats like even Rana coming out saying that he might vote no on a motion to vacate which like by the way I don't agree with I think the Democrats should be you know standing in opposition to any effort to save the Republicans from themselves I mean Let Them Fight let them vacate another speaker and see what happens especially ahead of an election where they're not going to get anything done regardless I  mean they're they're killing anything because it appears like it's a win for Biden but I've lost that argument I guess because you have even even Progressive Representatives saying that they'll save him because he put Ukraine funding through um regardless like I don't even know what this is it it is what I what is pissing off a lot of Republicans which is what it was for Nancy mace it's an opportunity to get on camera Matt Gates is an opportunity to get on camera and a way to look tough to the Republican base  when there's really no Avenue that Mike Johnson could take that would satisfy them because they want to shut the government down and they want all these budget cuts which would like the the president is a Democrat he's a right-wing Democrat but he's still a Democrat the Senate is controlled by democrats you can't just magically get what you want there are practical realities at place play you can't just get whatever you want because you want it but I mean that's a toddler's mentality and that kind of fits neatly  into what we know about margorie Taylor green although toddlers are much less racist and anti-semitic I got to be honest with you yeah Al can she get some new airpods those microphones are trash I know it's odd because she also went on Steve bannon's show to talk about it um Steve Bannon here this is him speaking about uh how the Democrats should sorry the Republicans should be voting for a motion to vacate you she was on his show as well Marjorie Taylor green is close with the white supremacist wing of the party here  led by Bannon these are his thoughts on uh on uh oh I guess this is just Bannon this is separate from her other interview with him this these are bannon's thoughts on Mike Johnson so they want to throw out the current Speaker of the House it's a terrible idea I'm working with the group of members to change the rules so that they can't get that done so that one knucklehead can't put the whole house into disarray by forcing another speaker vote we've got real problems we have a southern bordering crisis for $34  trillion in debt and America needs to be projecting strength abroad we should focus on that instead of these DC power Gams RH know okay there's a lot of consternation in the chat and we think there should be consternation and there should be anger I 100% agree with that and people were saying what can we do I tell you what you can do about it it's very simple you see that guy right there Dusty Johnson from what South Dakota uh he's the problem not the sole problem but he's part of the problem these guys are going to get their votes  today and these people that in D Johnson the 34 train D on bri you haven't done anything about it bro you have backed The Establishment on everything and this is in South Dakota the last time I looked at South Dakota a Maga State let's Replay that because what this geek and just look at that you'll see he's the personification of leadership uh and this the problem pause one second on Steve Bannon judging Somebody by their looks yeah I mean it's just to reflect on that look Dusty Dusty Johnson he  right from South he is AEK sure he is a geek but he's basically judging him I guess by being of a Slender figure but I don't know I mean is he is he a geek in a in a in a I don't know a 200 meter spr race Steve see van you might have some trouble there I mean he hasn't um dissolved any bodies in a acid in a hot tub um so maybe he's not as cool as some other people but um uh I if that guy said like uh Trump is the god king and there are hordes of uh Chinese people coming across the border then Steve  Bannon wouldn't be con him M geek no um he though is it's funny to hear a republican basically argue for a pre Kevin McCarthy reality the reason they're in this situation is because Kevin McCarthy is was so and that's why I find his ouer honestly just so delicious um he's resigning from Congress now because of it he made a deal with the devil to get into Power um and not the real devil just to Not freak out all the any of the people listening a met a metaphorical deal with the devil where basically he agreed with  this far right Fringe of his Fringe Far Right Far Far Right element of his party the attention seeking element of his party it's probably a better way to refer to it he agreed that okay I'll put this um trigger in place where if there's anything that you disagree with me on you can file a motion to vacate and if you get enough votes you can remove me from power and mo most Republicans I think with that slim of a majority and Pelosi didn't agree to it when she had a Slimmer majority before that by the way wouldn't have said this  is the the deal I'll do because it's just way too risky but Kevin McCarthy is one of the biggest careerists in the Republican party and he agreed to it and he made his own bed and got stabbed in the back and what do you know he basically brandished the knife and gave it to those eight Republicans who ended up asking him now that knife is still around and Marjorie Taylor green is holding and it's just like to continue this bad analogy Mike Johnson has armor on because the Democrats made it for him  keep going this is in South Dakota the last time I looked at South Dakota a Maga State let's Replay that because what this geek and just look at that is you'll see he's the personification of leadership uh and this is the problem most of those guys up there are like this guy that's the problem you want to start with the problem you got two things you got to back president Trump it's president Trump is not perfect but president Trump hey is 9 billion times better than any alternative that sounds close to we got  to get him back in the white house and have his back but also you got to start changing these guys out and and and this is in Maga States if you look at the most magga districts in my beloved South most of the establishment the the the Cardinals on the Appropriations the establishments the guys like wac are all from those districts this is not about closed districts like Lawler and these guys in New York I'm talking about magar red Trump red districts represented by uni party members and then you got places like you  know in Montana in in uh in South Dakota places like this throughout the country where you have this beauty right and he's going to sit there and give you all the happy talk he's not going to really come in and vote hard on hard NOS with Contin to burying us or to take the hard votes you need to take to say no we're not giving we have to project strength what is this guy know about strength we have to he says hardly the hard knows we have to be strong as opposed to like hey let's be weak yeah yeah I mean that  that's he's just insulting this this guy's General appearance he just hates this this guy like wears classes I know right he's just like this guy's a nerd and I would have shoved him in a locker he's from the he's from South but not the real south that I love and his blood pressure is probably normal too he's on way less drugs than I am that's it's weird I mean I mean his number one drug comes out of a bottle but um where is he does you know where he he shoots this looks like he's in Palm Springs or  right it must beid God forbid he' be in Liberal California um anyway though that's uh the the that's bannon's take on all of this and Trump would be nine billion times better he's not perfect but he's just nine billion times better than anyone else like well what does perfect mean at that point right right he's not perfect but he's basically Jesus Christ so by the way I am perfect yeah right got that wrong Steve um let's take another call here e 	Liberal			Center	97
I225	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrrLKJrD58E	[Applause] right hello and welcome this isn't the video I thought I was going to be doing today to be honest um very worrying events happening in the Ukraine I think it's fair to say that Russia is now at War with the Ukraine just feels bizarre just saying it so it's uncertain how things will play out over the next weeks or months with the Ukraine and the surrounding areas one thing is certain um is that because of the because of the Tak down of the communication structures that are happening in the  Ukraine and there will be a need for civilian radio ham radio to play a part now currently in the Ukraine um ham radio is basically banned because of a the emergency um the state of emergency in the Ukraine so ham radio at the moment is banned um just to try and keep some sort of Law and Order however that will I have a feeling that will change as things progress with with this this Invasion what I want to do in this video is just to just to emphasize that um US amateur ham radio people and shortwave listeners  we do have a role to play here um a very important role in not getting involved keeping frequencies clear and clear we have a responsibility for those people who are in the Ukraine those areas to maintain their safety but what I want to do is actually just to look at some of the places um where we may hear some radio activity one of the things that we would be useful really is to look at um three areas three areas of of um amateur and Commercial radio from the Ukraine in the surrounding areas one is  the broadcast um stations on medium wave another is looking at the use of the repeaters in Ukraine that are connected to DMR D um C4 FM and then uh we've got HF that may play a part in this as well uh there's a Wikipedia page that will list out the current active radio stations in the Ukraine and you can tell by the frequencies on the left uh where to look for for them on whether it's on a web SDR or like I I have here I've got amateur radi equipment and I can tune in and try and find some activity  [Applause] there's a lot of activity on one of the um stations at the moment whether that's pre broadcast or live I don't know yet we have to be mindful as well that there's surrounding areas like the bellarus and a few of those areas that are are going to be on the height and state of alert as well and it's possible that their radio stations their communication networks could be affected um because this isn't going to be a surgical um strike by the Russians by the looks of it I'm no expert in this  kind of stuff but it looks really scary to be honest the second place to look is that there there is quite an active DMR um community in the Ukraine uh and I'll share a link to the site where you can look up the DMR rooms and the cross linking so whether you've got darar whether you got DMR capability you you may be able to to join those rooms on there like I said before really we should just be ears what we shouldn't be doing is contrib in to the noise what we shouldn't be doing is possibly raising  security risks by getting too involved this is purely ears only that's my advice that's just that's my take on it in the moment so there's a list here of some DMR frequencies that are worth tuning into you don't necessarily have to have DMR equipment or D Equipment some of these rooms you can find a live feed on um on internet so the the way that DMR and D start works is that um I can transmit from this location here to a local trans a local repeater station up on the hill that repeater station may  also be connected to the internet so not only can that repeat my VHF UHF signal locally it'll also feed that into a electronic room a DMR room or D room through um through server basically now if the if the internet is still running in a lot of these places we may get activity through those rooms so that's why I'm just highlighting them for the moment on on HF this is where it can get a bit tricky um we may we may find that certain frequencies are going to be allocated to help out with the emergency um with the ban on on amateur  radio I'm not sure this is going to work in this case but there there may be some frequencies allocated on certain times of the day for purely for monitoring for emergency broadcasts or emergency communications we please be mindful of them whether you're interested in listening for any activity in the Ukraine just if you're an amateur radio Operator just look out for any frequencies that have been um held um and avoid them Ju Just just let them get on with it um what we may find as time goes on that um CW most code maybe  even applications like js8 call may be used as well it's it's unknown how this is going to pan out whether people will actually use HF radio as part of the the um the Fallout the the em mergency uh situation just be mindful it may do and maybe just best to keep an eye on that and avoid that in my previous video I was up in the Peak District in the remote Barn that I use up there to when I was tuning in to the Russian Ground Force transmission frequencies and there's there's a number of them I'll put a link in below to  where you can find those stations um they're still going they they're still running uh it would be interesting uh if you've got an interest in that is maybe tune in to them as well because um their activity may change I don't know what they do when they're in a state of War whether they just keep to the same broadcast schedules or not I don't know um other types of Transmissions especially on the HF um not in the amateur bands in between the amateur bands we may see an increase of um activity not just from uh the Russian  forces and the Ukraine and neighbors but from NATO so we may see an increase of military Transmissions completely encrypted in some ways we feel very lucky we just sit here with all our radio equipment um with a an interest in what's happening but for those people that are experiencing it it's it's nightmarish and you know that really is worrying I realize this is not the typical video from me but normal service will be resumed as soon as possible my next video I'm hoping to get out and listen to Nature's radio signals with  just some simple equipment so that's all organized I'm just waiting for break in the weather to get outdoors and do that and I look forward to that one and I look forward to seeing you on the next video so bye-bye for now 	Leaning Liberal			Center	98

officers and making a fool out of herself [Music] I hi I think she's stretching her back out she's doing calisthetics all right that is so cute that's what I thought that's what I thought Isabelle's attempts at seducing  the officers didn't work as they decided to transfer her to a different facility before that officers drove her to a hospital for a checkup in case she sustained any injuries from the crash Isabelle was charged with a DUI but it may be infuriating to know that she's now walking free as the case against her was dismissed due to the officer failing to show up in court for the trial but Karen's acting stupidly doesn't end here it gets even worse on 18th of January 2021 Brook Park police department  responded to Mark's store after reports of a woman refusing to leave the

crime for the dumb Karen would go on yet another tie raid in an unrelated DUI case her excuse she didn't have her cell phone with her to look up the law the last place you'd think of finding a drunk Karen is at an office workplace but not the least on 20th February 2023 officers KRON and Barnett responded to a call about an intoxicated ex-employee at a Chevrolet dealership the woman had arrived to work earlier in the day but wasn't Under the Influence as the day passed she became  noticeably intoxicated and began arguing with other employees the Karen was subsequently fired and asked to leave the property but refused and remained at her desk officers caon and Barnett arrived and attempted to persuade the woman to leave but she ignored their orders too she was on the phone and one of my other employees downstairs heard the person that she was on the phone need to stop drinking while on the job okay so we just terminated her like probably 10 minutes before I called you guys and she's refusing to leave okay  are you her director prer yeah I'm the manager yeah he ma'am how are you hi you doing okay yeah um hi what's your name I am officer Kon from for police hi um how may I

next dumb Karen is convinced that laws don't apply to her what are you going to do with my car probably tell her why because you are driving without a license I don't have to have a license that is Commercial Driving it is not commercial yes it is on January 17th 2022 this Anonymous woman had been pulled over after going 54 mph in a 35 mph Zone an officer conducting a routine check on Pensacola Bay Bridge came across this vehicle and having seen this decided to pull it over to inspect what  was going on without any idea of the kind of person he was about to encounter young lady officer Banks SC brief police pars I'm point you doing 54 and a 35 any reason for that speed tonight where was a 35 before you got off the bridge and as soon as you came off the bridge all this is 35 I was going 40 I thought nope you got your license registration proof Insurance you don't have to have a license to drive car yes yes she did you do not 157 41 with me having been explained why she was being pulled over  the woman doesn't see her fault and when requested for a driver's license she makes the shocking statement that she's not required to have one in order to drive a car now this is something you only see in the movies step out the vehicle am I yeah you are being detained right now step out the vehicle young lady I I am I right either you step out the vehicle I will remove you from the vehicle I know my rights 157 Sovereign supervis Sovereign citizen did you hear what I said you need to get a supervisor out here right  now no you need to step out the vehicle right now super young lady step the step out the vehicle last time I'm going to ask you I'm going to ask I'm going to ask then I'm going to make you move step out the vehicle you're going to get me a supervisor out here right now no you're going to step out the vehicle right now you are going to get me a supervisor out here right now that's fine as the officer asks her to step out of her vehicle she denies it and instead asks for his supervisor claiming to know her  rights but does she really I know my right what right is that I I do not have to have a driver's license to drive a car I am not this is not a commercial vehicle okay I know know my right okay very well that's what you want to stick with call a supervisor right now all right right now or else what I know my rights if I don't call supervisor or else what I guess we're not going to go anywhere then just hold it for me and go and give me the channel you need to get a super be that can educate you on what the law is okay  this woman is clearly as she claims she doesn't need a driver's license to drive around because it's not a commercial car the officer who's amused is taken AB back when she says she could teach the law to him so you're not going to give me a driver's license I'm not going to give you a driver's license I don't have to give you a driver's license okay I'm I'm traveling I don't I don't have to have a driver's license to drive a vehicle okay in what state is that any state it's common law natural law okay  constitutional law okay you need to get a supervisor out here I do yes okay her declarations that it's a natural and constitutional law in all states to not have a driver's license if you're driving non-commercially are absolutely nuts at this point the officer couldn't believe the audacity of this woman to persistently ask for his supervisor as an excuse to not provide any of her details and calls for his sergeant not long after the officer's Sergeant arrives at the scene and is put in context of the whole situation  unfortunately for her he's not as calm as the first officer so you do need a license to drive the vehicle and you do have to identify yourself to these officers I I do not have to have the license to drive a vehicle yes you do I do not you're wrong but okay I know common law natural La I don't care about common law you're in the State of Florida you're in the State of Florida you're in the State of Florida doesn't matter in what state it doesn't matter I'm in the US it does matter so you better hope the information you gave us  comes back is to being you so at this point in time I need you to shut the vehicle off and step out of the car I'm I'm not getting out of the vehicle you're going to get out of the car I haven't been suspected of a crime you are being legally stopped on a traffic stop you are not being cooperative it is not a ter stop trust me I know the difference you were speeding turn the vehicle off and get out of the car out of the car now undo the seat belt turn the vehicle off turn it off now off unbuckle  so that's it put all that down step out turn my face away from me turn my face away turn around I do not have to have a driver's license to drive a vehicle yes you do no I do not well then you can tell that to the judge if you end up going to jail I do not have to have a driver's license to drive a vehicle I have all the laws right there care I don't care what laws you say you have I know that you don't care because you're you're supposed to be a police officer off this is you should know that this conversation's over then  right you don't care about the laws you don't care about our rights that's the problem sadly for this woman her imaginary laws don't apply in Florida and she's detained once in the backseat of the car she surprisingly starts asking if she can call her mom can I please call my mother you cannot why because you don't need to call you are you an adult yes then why do you need to call your mother to come and get me from jail since I'm being illegally detained you will be to call her once you get there can I at least lock my car we will  make sure it is secure what are you going to do with my car probably tell it why because you are driving without a license I don't have to have a license to drive that is Commercial Driving it is not Commercial Driving yes it is having asked to call her mother is a clear sign of the type of person she is and how she was raised never taking responsibility for her actions and being always protected from the consequences seeing no way out of the situation her demeanor and complete attitude all of a sudden changes to that  of a Cooperative person just be honest Sergeant please you don't have a license okay I I'll never drive again yes you will because you believe you don't have to have a license I'll go get a driver's license tomorrow well wait a minute now you now you're telling me that you'll go get a license because you're telling me that I have believe you don't that's correct you have no choice Sergeant Turner please this is no this is the road that's being taken and this is what's going to happen and if this madness wasn't enough already when  the police ran a background check on her it was revealed that she had a warrant for not appearing in court you failed to appear on the court appearance for what was it expired license so your Mississippi driver's license is expired and for the registration okay and the registration so you had a court date that you missed do you remember that no I don't you don't or you choose not to no sir I would not lie to you I don't lie I I do not remember that okay well you do have a warrant out of Santa Rosa County  so regardless Santa Rosa County you're in Santa Rosa County do you not know where you live I just moved here my mother lives on high points when did you move here about 2 months ago from pasola Mississippi okay and you don't know what county you live in now after two months I don't I don't that's not something that's I use often what county I live in okay having her story shown multiple gaps her situation gets even worse when the officer checking her car finds ammunition but not a gun where's the gun  in the car the gun there's no gun in that car seems to be ammo the gun's in a pawn chop when did you pawn it like two months ago so why are you still just carrying around ammo I didn't know that ammo was in there what's wrong with carrying around ammo What Can I Do Without a Gun nothing all right is wrong with it but if there's ammo normally there's a gun and since the vehicle's being towed we want to keep the gun in safekeeping and in a not so shocking finding at this point the officers find a plastic bag of  white powder which to the surprise of no one turned out to be cocaine give me your full name give me your full name look at me give me your full name give me your full name drugs inside the vehicle you are under under arrest now for possession of felony narcotics the woman is finally arrested for possession of cocaine adding to her charges of DUI for the influence of alcohol or drugs and operating a motor vehicle without a valid license her face says it all but she isn't the only woman who pretended  to be a lawyer this next Karen is lucky to have survived after crashing and flipping it over however she is not thankful for it as she throws a tantrum while being arrested for drunk driving you didn't read me my Miranda rides and you also didn't tell me what I was under arrest for do you remember that on August 20th 2023 Wisconsin police officers were called to a neighborhood regarding an intoxicated woman who had hit a parked car which resulted in her car being flipped over she's right there whose car is this um that's my  grandson's

the car on the side of the road or how did I did there was no car on the side of the road there wasn't not to my knowledge no there was a car drive this way I was clearly driving in my Lane the suspect identified as Rachel didn't hesitate to deny that she had been drinking and started acting entitled you had anything to drink tonight Rachel um no I haven't  just be honest with me no it's not going to like it's not going to incriminate you any further or anything no I know no no nothing to drink huh not since 600 p.m. 6 p.m. so I would say a few hours yeah like what did you have at six I

answering any more of your question questions I think I've made that very clear all right well I'm just getting on scene so I don't know what's going on I think I've made it very clear that any more questions anyone ask me why why do you think you need an attorney right now um I think in general any citizen that encounters a law enforcement officer outside of any neural circumstance should just refer that to an attorney okay so any any interaction  with so I I don't think that any interaction you and I have beyond what him and I heard have you been drinking tonight I haven't been drinking tonight I can smell the alcohol from you well I guess you can smell the alcohol from me but I haven't been drinking so okay why am I smelling alcohol from you that obviously condescending attitude and no worries if she might have hurt anyone is beyond infuriating refusing to take any field sobriety tests Rachel is immediately placed under arrest what am I under arrest for  operating well under the influence of alcohol and is that assumptive or assured I don't know what you mean by that um is that an assumed offense or is that an assured I still don't know what you mean by that okay I didn't think so it's okay that's [Music] okay um I mean did you assume I was operating under alcohol or had you been assured by some sort of test you just assumed right correct and is our conversation being recorded yes it is yes it is correct so you assumed I was operating my vehicle correct is that correct yes or  no okay so that was correct right that's why you arrested me you assumed I was operating my vehicle correct what happened to you not talking well don't want talk anymore dear TR to arrest a lawyer the only bar this Karen passed was the mini bar for another shot Rachel had the right to remain silent but not the ability as she starts grilling the officers on why she's arrested that cop obviously has a lot of patience Rachel was charged with ow first and was cited for failure to maintain control unsafe Lane deviation  and no proof of insurance and entitled Kens such as this next one try to cause a scene by riing people up in order to avoid getting arrested after being caught but it almost always never goes well I did not take it out of the store don't do that I did not take it I did not take it out the store stop I didn't take it I didn't take it I didn't take it on 27 of February 2022 officers were called to a mall regarding a woman who stole expensive cologne from sax as the officers caught up to the woman and  confronted her she denied any allegations against her

have an IDE so once I take you into custody and I look in your purse well you going take me into custody though the store employees tell the officer that they all  saw her steal but the woman claimed they were all lying and she was being falsely accused while the suspect searched for her ID on her phone an officer takes statements from the employee who witnessed her stealing tell me what happened sir okay so I was sitting in women's shoes talking to another associate I saw her walk in through our men's door right she's walking through uh passing through jewelry eyballs me the whole way I already knew something was up I saw her over at our Creek counter looked to my left she's standing  there staring right at me again so I walked around handbags cuz I was going to approach her from the other side and then by that time she was she was already gone so and then all the ladies in cosmetics are like oh they just took two bottles and then on the way out she asked one of our other associates for a bag and she wouldn't give her one so she have the attitude with the associate and then just walked out of the store and then they all started calling me oh she took a bottle I was like yeah I know  exactly who it is I was just watching it and then so and then that's turn I call uh all security to see if they can possibly Lo so you got you got two is just the $500 bottle or two

going trying to say big or small which as far as the price of what they look like so what kind of perfumes are it do you know uh  Creed aventus I'm not sure if it was the men's or the women's cuz they make both but it is creative ENT is it possible is it possible a footage of her actually doing it have camera right maintaining that she did not take anything from the store the Karen starts resisting and screaming after the employee shows officers a video recording of her stealing the perfume which is grounds for the officers to arrest the woman and then I think she was trying to look for a little bag or something to put it in may you see she  walked away with the little black bag okay is more I just saw the video mhm okay and I do believe that it was taken so I'll give believe I took it yes so

I247	https://youtu.be/hGqqwoFbG7M?si=LJoI4ooaLi4Y0Kki	At noon. A 38 year old man is dead after an alleged home invasion in Muskegon County early this morning. It happened just before two o'clock on Chatterson Road north of Apple and Eagleton Township. Deputies say they were called to a report of the man pounding on an apartment window before illegally entering the apartment. They say the man assaulted the tenant then tried to break into the connected home. That's when the homeowner shot the man who died from his injuries. Muskegon County deputies say they are still investigating that shooting  for the second. 	Leaning Conservative			Leaning Liberal	100
I262	https://youtu.be/itBonC6xR3o?si=r43AarQ_WJVbVB6H	hello hello it's Patty Joe I am sorry it's been like five days four days something like that um had work and I am now a vehicle owning person now I did oh I've just had the motorcycle for a while but you don't go to the grocery store and the Motorcycle I mean if you're going to go you're going to go like to like some far off one and you only get like what ever fits in your saddle bags or your backpack not a whole grocery chip so you can't like go to Costco on it although I've been known to so got myself a new  car so I now I still feel like I don't have it you know like because even when I borrowed my son's car I felt like I couldn't like drive it places like I couldn't use it frivolously so I don't know it's going to take me a while to get used to being like mobile again but there you go and there is some d i about a used car so there's some damage I got to fix it so we're going to move into that if you're interested let me know I'll tell you what we are on day nine Day N I think there's like 15 days of we  we're like over the halfway mark all right let's see let's see what durl has to say see what dum dum girl has to say let's go here see record should reflect that the individual known to this court as darl Brooks is President okay looking at all his papers got his got his paperback Bible good morning everyone I will get started I will call state of Wisconsin versus uh darl Brooks case number 21 CF 1848 may I have the appearances please good morning judge Sue oper Leslie bazy and Zach wow appearing for the state of  Wisconsin good morning good morning sir please state your name for the record I'm here as a third party intervenor in that matter appearing as authorized representative for my client I set for value and return for Value all of the charging instruments in this matter and make my exemption available for discharge of all obligations and charges connected with this case I do not dispute any other facts in the charging instruments record should reflect that the individual known to this court as darl Brooks is present in person in  custody in Street clothing wearing a suit and tie and a mask for the record I do not consent to being called that name I don't cons to be all right we still have yet to address subject matter jurisdiction the it for the record so for the record has it been proven um Mr Brooks I stand by the written decision that I issued in this case last week a second copy was please don't interrupt me a second copy was provided to you I know you saw it CU you tore it up yesterday um so I'm not going to address  it any further you are mistaken and wrong about the law that it needs to be verified or proven um are you talking about the paper I accepted in return for Value so with that value return for Value Mr Brooks I'm going to continue with this trial whether you believe jurisdiction has been proven or not it has not been proven for the record and it has so that detective uh Carpenter was on the stand and it needs to be proving and I part of prosecution would like to have him brought back up unless there's any other issues the parties  wish the court to address from the state I did want to address something briefly go ahead um as the court knows from short discussions yesterday the state will be playing a couple videos of the defendants in his statements um the court had previously heard those as part of a motion hearing and I'm not sure if I'm really getting the defendant notice or what I'm doing but I I really tried hard and I I'm pulling out Snippets from this because if the court recalls there are a lot of references that the defendant  makes to Prior domestics with Erica um his prior record things that the court had previously excluded so I'm going through and I am um pulling specific time um ranges from this so that nothing that was previously ruled um in admissible comes in and I guess obviously this defendant has the absolute right to cross-examine the witness he has the right and we've offered and we have been um putting exhibits up for him but I do want it to be noted that I would not be willing to have Mr Brooks just say oh go to about the 7  Minute Mark um because if he even goes like two seconds before a clip that I had played or two seconds after it could include information that was previously ruled and admissible and I guess what I would say to the defendant is the court has previously protected the defendant um to make sure that things didn't come out where he asked a question that could be construed opening the door and the court said we're not going to go there Mr Brooks and he got the message however with this if there's any portion of this  video that's played that talks about the prior with Erica I do consider that that he has opened the door and I will be asking the witness about it so I guess this is maybe more so directed at Mr Brooks that if he plays clips that um contain that information he will have opened the door he's had this video for weeks at least um this these videos have been he understands opening the door exactly the same as he understands hear say and subject matter jurisdiction he does not understand it he he thinks it should go the way he  wants it only have information that he wants it but the record should been clear and accurate subject to a motion hearing I'm not sure exactly what accy had I've reviewed the 5H hour video a number of times I've been very meticulous in my timestamps that I'm grabbing out from here and ious am unwilling to have the defendant put Miss Gussy in a spot where he's kind of well around this point he needs to give exact times that he wants um started and stopped because what happens is if he says okay can you pause here by  the time he says that 5 Seconds may have gone by which may be enough to some of these if I would play two more seconds than what I have here it would open the door so I just want the defendant to realize that this is kind of a slippery slope here and um he proceeds at his own risk and I'm not going to ask asked Miss Gussy to stop it at a certain time because I think something's about to be said um that's on the defendants um and if he opens the door I can um assure you I will I will go into it um so I did  want to put that on the record judge not to be a jerk about it but just once it's out there I can't not address it and if it's the defendant who brings it out there um into the view of the jury then I going to feel compelled to address it um and then I didn't know if the court wanted to go through the preliminary instruction that you had provided previously on The Interpreter my understanding is that Mr Marquez speaks very little English um if you want to add the um added paragraph that would be fine for the state we've  had very I've had two discussions with him and uh I would not say he is um that English is a comfortable language for him all right thank you as to the first part to what the state brings up regarding the redacted recording I would remind Mr Brooks the court did enter some rulings previously why do you have to roll your eyes at me let's start the morning off on a good note I roll my eyes at you so I don't think it's fair that you should say I roll my eyes I saw you roll your eyes at me I'm I didn't  roll my eyes at you so don't don't do that Mr you did I'd appreciate a little bit more respect these R let me finish because now you're interrupting me these rulings were entered by the court um to prevent other acts evidence from coming in but a defendant can open the door in a variety of ways these recordings and I have reviewed them previously uh do contain uh discussion and statements by you regarding these other acts and as you heard from attorney bayy she has all of the time stamps to stop at  appropriate time so that the state does not run a file of those pre-trial rulings you can open the door by asking questions by asking for a video to be played um and not knowing those exact timestamps I think it's important that I reinforce what the state has just advised you of uh so that when you are watching the recording as all of us will be um if there is something you want replayed and you want to cross-examine the witness about that you know those time stamps and then the state has graciously indicated they would assist  once again in replaying portions of that video I don't need a respond resp from you unless you feel you would like to give a response to any of that with all due respect they're the ones that want to play the video so I don't I don't understand how I'm the one opening the door they chose to play the video soine they're not going to play the entire video though they're going to redact out probably stop fast forward the portions that this court said would would be in admissible so if you so for example if  during your cross-examination of detective carpender you ask the state to replay a portion of the video and you say go back to around the 7 Minute Mark you have to understand that you may open the door even inadvertently to some of those other acts evidence coming in so what I'm telling you is if you want any portions replayed then or if you ask for the entire video to be played under the rule of completeness that you have an understanding that you would be opening the door to the evidence of other acts  coming in potentially I'll have to rule on it at that time um but so be mindful of the time stamps uh I don't understand in your honor that that'll be that's almost like you making the ruling and then it and not having any standing if you already made the rulings against them I told the state they can't offer this evidence right they're the so if you offer the evidence or ask questions that would open the door that's a different story and we all have treaded lightly when you've asked questions that  would have opened the door to a variety of witnesses so the state's just simply saying look we're going to do our job we're not going to put in the other act evidence we're going to pause the video fast forward the appropriate spots but if you want any portions replayed or if you ask for the entire video to be played uh then you do that at your peril of having those other acts evidence come in so that's all I want to tell you um he doesn't like that as far as the jury instruction uh do you have any position  on whether that second well I shouldn't say second it's the very last paragraph where it says add the following if appropriate do you have any position on whether the court uh reads this entire jury instruction 60 to the jury prior to Mr Marquez being called as a witness yeah I think the jury should hear whatever need needs that they need to hear do you have a position on that last paragraph specifically sir given the information that the state has provided today you're a stomping in Brackets and it's  after a bolded section that says add the following if appropriately advise the parties yesterday we would be talking about that this morning he's really reading because his head's moving I mean it was just stated that um the witness doesn't speak very good English and okay brace yourself for the barrage of stupid questions about people who don't speak [Music] English oh my God people who don't speak English so that would that would indicate that it would be a lot more work for The Interpreter so to  make sure that's not what I'm asking about sir I'm asking whether you whether you have a position on whether I include the very last paragraph of that instruction uh to the jury no I don't feel like that needs to be read to the jury I think it's pretty it's pretty clear from the from all the language leading up to that let me ask attorney bayy a question about um the contact the office of the district attorney has had with Mr Mark were you able to communicate at all in any way in English even if you would  describe it as broken English yes I think our last conversation we probably said um I said something in English he responded and then when I said something else I think he needed translation for that his primary or victim witness person um specialist assigned to the case is bilingual and she speaks to him in Spanish all right given that um bit of information provided by the da and Office of the court regarding his ability to answer some but not most I think it's appropriate to read the very last paragraph um certainly doesn't hurt  it's not going to take away so I will read the entirety of jury instruction 60 obviously the part that's uh says read here if appropriate comes out uh and then um I will print that off and uh that is what I will read at the appropriate time did that print Madam clerk quick question on that um this is a dum question how do we know exactly what words uh the witness will be able to understand in English versus that's not how the interpretation works the questions are in English they're interpreted in Spanish what what  works excuse me sir who speaks Spanish what words did in English do you understand can you give me a list of them so I can make sure to slip in the English words what an idiot what a dumb question to the witness the witness will answer presumably in Spanish uh and then the witness's words will be interpreted in English and it's the English as this instruction says that is the evidence I think it's a little unfair that the prosecution has had conversations with the witness and I haven't considering that it's my witness they  were on the state's witness list as well I believe so um it's fair for either party to reach out and if Witnesses want to talk to either party uh in preparation that's frankly fair game so how how would I be able to reach out to a Whitney Mr Brooks you are representing yourself that uh obviously poses some challenges and difficulties but that is the state and Stage that we are at so with that um I know we get detective Carpenter on the stand he can come up and be out here uh when the jury comes  out um so come on up sir I will swear you in again as is my practice when there's a witness on the stand for a second I have one more thing real quick um well it needs to be other than subject matter jurisdiction so what is it you didn't even let me get to it I said what is it I said it needs to be something other than subject matter jurisdiction can I get to it there's no way to know what I'm going to say if I can't say it Mr Brooks please tell me what it is you'd like to address I I would want to address why my um icfs  have not been addressed because I know you have them why have I not getting copies I've gotten copies of every other ICF why not the the recent ones sir I am not uh going to be the intermediary anymore for icfs that are directed to the uh clerk of court regarding copies that's not that's not explaining why I haven't record there something you want me to address then you should address your ICF to me and not the clerk of court well where is the where is the ICF if I sent it I should be able to get a  copy I've gotten copies of every single one whether they were for that from the clerk whether they were addressed to you or whether they were addressed to the cler of Courts I've always not going to address that further Mr Brooks I'm not going to be the intermediary when you have questions to the clerk of court so what's the point of me sending the ICF me doing what you asked me to do and sending them and then not being able to know if they've even been received and get a copy of them which I've been getting copies of ask for a  copy of the ICF they don't have any obligation to I addressed I addressed it when I first sent it I asked you on the record did you receive it Mr Brooks I didn't receive anything because nothing has been sent to me if there's something that you need then you should reach back out to the clerk of court we're not going to take up court time regarding an ICF sent to the clerk of court again I will advise you once once again I did this the other day if there's something case related it needs to be addressed to  me if it has to do with the record it needs to go to the clerk of court and it was it sent to the clerk of court the but I still should I still should be able to be told if it was received and get a copy which you've done that before every single ICF and I told you I would no longer be doing that sir because of this very issue ites you say so now it changes so now it changes all of a suddenly no it didn't change all of a sudden and you know that so don't try to does it change all of a suddenly all  because I've been getting copies of everything I've sent which is what you asked me to this changed last week and you know that it shouldn't change I don't I'm bringing the jury out and I'm not addressing this issue so I want I want the copy of my ICS that I send um send the request to the I don't have to send her another request where's the one that I just sent last week all right the jury is going to come out so please be respectful I I will but at the same time you still have to I did what you asked  me to do if tell me to do something and I do it and then now you're saying I'm not going to get a copy which youve been providing them ever since ever since you told me to do it you're making my Mr Brooks the rules on that changed last week no no it did not I'm still supposed to be able to say if it's been received or not so why should I have to send multiple icfs to even know if they they've been received that's ridiculous I'm going to give the parties the um final version of Journey instruction 60  which I will be reading at the appropriate time come on you can't change stuff at the last minute you as me to I did it as a courtesy frankly you're not courteous me I'm not even not even I'm not even refering refering to the fact I'm referring to the fact nobody's gonna do you a favor if you are a big poopy head you are a you're a horrible monster and then you expect people to bend over backwards for you that you haven't even enough respect to tell mece to the jury they're coming out okay that doesn't that doesn't uh mean  that you shouldn't be able to tell me if my ICF has been received icfs that you told me to submit you told me that you told me that that is a gentleman of the jury you will disregard the commentary by Mr I accept for value and return for Value this document just like you've been hiding everything from the jury that they the jury will disregard the court is not hiding anything from the jury yeah you are so Mr Brooks please be respectful of the jury they're coming out you should be respectful you are  addressing issues that are not related to evidence are you actually do something please and then now it changes everyone can be seated thank you this is ridiculous just like subject matter jurisdiction hasn't been proved for mistrial just like you're making judicial determinations that you don't have to prove anything by law hold on which is a tacket agreement by you your honor ladies and gentlemen of the jury the please disregard the statements currently made by Mr Brooks incorrect St ments of the law prove that they're  incorrect prove in this case where's the proof where's the legal proof and you need to disregard them because you don't

ended up calling a guy just to use his phone kind of loitering around and just you know how you end up how you ended up kind of being that's what they say no no no I was going to say I I I knocked on his door to use his  phone y right but it probably wasn't him that called because he got his phone but someone was concerned about something so just trying to figure out what's going on down in that neighborhood does that make sense yeah okay all right he kind of you know like I said I probably that wasn't probably the best but I was just like I need to get a uber I have money on my cash app card yep so I'm not trying to rob anybody I'm not trying to break it and obviously you can tell I'm not drunk I'm not you know I was just trying to escape from  the scene of my last crime yeah Uber under

yes sir understanding the above rights uh derell are you willing to speak with me US primarily me I'm the one that's be doing most of talking probably uh I just want to know a little bit more about what's going on just a little bit because like I told you I know very little I just know that you know you're down in this neighborhood someone called you know they didn't know what you were  doing down there and things like that so I got limited from their side but I'm looking to see you know what you have to say about it I'm looking to see you know maybe maybe a lot of maybe the caller was just on some BS down there you know I don't know you know I don't know but but I can't I can't really show the court that if I don't have you know if I haven't talked to you so that's why I'm here just to kind of see what you got to say about it get your side of it you know running around a neighborhood's not  not the end of the world it's not a huge deal right right right right unfortunately I wouldn't had to do that if if I made better decisions with women yeah but not going to point the finger sure I'm a grown man I make my own decisions so yeah you are you got going point the finger in nobody I just yeah didn't think didn't think yeah what the hell you want to speak me not right [Music] now not right now so was a decision made to speak with Mr Brooks the following day being called their name leading the  witness the objections are overruled the witness May answer yes ma'am it was now when you spoke with the defendant on the 21st what did you have some general information as to casualties from the yes I did what information did you have at that point at that point not all the information was in yet but I knew um as I stated in previous testimony um our emergency department was very full um I knew there were significant injuries to many people um I knew some were deceased I did not know the exact number at that  time you had um approximately another couple minutes of conversations with Mr Brooks before you called it a night um was he what was the vibe that you got from him during those couple minutes objection I don't consent to being called that name is leading wi the objections overruled you may answer I would say friendly I think when you heard the the clip there um Mr Brooks jokes about Riverside and football the IND ual he was talking to at that time was detective Stern um as you can't obviously see him in the video  um I could sense I believe you can hear it in Mr Brooks's voice in that clip um the FBI put him on edge it was unusual to see them I could sense the nervousness he did transition as I talk to him more throughout that clip into a more normal conversation tone again but when I was speaking with Mr Brooks casually throughout the night that was the type of tone um he had with us it was very friendly and he seemed when it came to myself in detective Stern very comfortable speaking with us now you had  stated your initial intent was to talk to him about loitering in the area that he was arrested do you recall that objection spe to you over roll the witness my answer yes I do did Mr Brooks at all talk to you about the loitering in terms of what the focus of your investigation was that night objection I don't consent to being called that name leading the witness overruled the witness May answer yes the statements he made in there um you know about you know being in the area because he needed an Uber um  you know he he says more you know to us about not knowing the area walk he doesn't know the streets things of that nature and he just needed an Uber to get home um so yeah that was that was his reasoning for for being down there and he stuck to that reasoning the entire time direct your attention then to the next day so strike that that night was he transported to a moso police department yes he was and did you go to moso Police Department yes I did um did you transport him so it was a dual transport uh officer  Lea from the walkshop police department responded to walk Memorial Hospital in a in a marked squad car that has a uh inappropriate rear back seat transport compartment Mr Brooks was placed in that car and myself and detective Stern followed in a separate car so that comment is very important for them to say and get on the record um there's very little that you know they have to like guess say validate but appropriate transport of people in custody is huge the entire I don't know people call it unrest and some people call it riot and  whatever that happened in Baltimore after Freddy gray is specifically and directly because of the way police transported that person and did not secure and even afterwards there are people in um what they deemed at one time to be appropriate transport with the person cuffed and then if it the if the van stops short and there's somebody even after Mr Gray who hit their head on the front of the of the back of the van and was hurt I don't know if he was killed but I'd have to look into it but documenting and putting on the  record that they had to go in two cars and the reason was so that he was in an appropriate vehicle to be transported is actually something that really needs to be said and and validated by by the police because they do transport people in compromised um positions that they can't def you know would be able to help themselves or stop themselves from being injured have you not been you know restricted in those ways specifically handcuffs and specifically hand behind your back so important tiny little fact but important  once you get to C Police Department do you do anything there objection leading over roll you may answer not the first night myself and detective Stern stood by while some basic medical questions that were part of moso police department's policy as far as holding a prisoner were asked of him um I was there until Mr Brooks was placed into his cell once Mr Brooks was in his cell I explained to him that I me personally would be returning the next day to speak with him more and give him more information about the investigation did  Officer Lea end up staying at the moso police department with the defendant objection sply to you overrule yes he did why was that objection how's that overruled that was moso's request being Mr Brooks was although so because of the transition and we did not have our own Municipal lockup facility um we requested to use moso police departments and they allowed it but being Mr Brooks was technically in our custody they requested that one of our officers stay um there to do the monitoring and the jail so did you return to the city of  moso police department the next day November 20 seconds um to speak with Mr Brooks again objection I don't cons to be quot over ruled you may answer yes I did did you return with anyone um I returned with Detective bener now what was the plan for this interview you had said the previous day the intent was to kind of start very low just looking at loitering um did you have a plan going into the interview on the 22nd objection leading overrule I did what was that planned so the plan was was different  from the prior day so the interview with Mr Brooks on the 22nd didn't start till about a little afternoon that a that afternoon 12:11 p.m. to be exact around 8:00 a.m. that morning there was a briefing with all officers that were involved where I learned some additional information um one of the things I learned that morning was that there was a domestic abuse incident that had occurred between Daryl Brooks and Erica Patterson something I was not aware of when I was with Mr Brooks during the evening hours of  November 21st um there was also much more information at this point in regards to the parade incident um as I had stated in my earlier testimony it was very very chaotic that first night um between radio traffic and what I could hear going on down in the downtown as I had stated it was really unlike anything I've ever been involved in but by Tuesday Morning the 22nd we had narrowed it down to basically just Mr Brooks that there were not four people in this car we were looking at one man so he was now  a suspecting the domestic abuse and driving in the parade so I chose to begin the interview on the less serious matter that being the the battery charge that he was looking at with Erica Patterson now you said Tuesday the 22nd um Monday excuse me okay thank you and um what do you try to do when you're meeting with someone do do you try to establish any type of rapport with that person is that helpful you how did you approach this interview on the 22nd objection leading I'm also St us to the form of the question it was actually  compound if you could rephrase how did you approach the question of Mr Brooks on the 22nd objection I don't consent to being name witness my answer so when I began to speak with Daryl Brooks on the 22nd um I began with some very light conversation I explained to Mr Brooks that I had more information from the previous day I explained to Mr Brooks that his girlfriend at that time Erica Patterson had made some domestic abuse allegations against him that were physical in nature I didn't indicate to	Liberal			Center	101

took him to reaps I've done everything I'm not on it no more thank God but he is I can't get him off from what was your brother doing that got him shot by the cops he was he was doing dope but he thought my sister-in-law had got it hit it from him so he was just trying to lead her into the house but my niece thought he was going to beat her but he wasn't beating her I followed him into the H

I332	https://youtu.be/huvStjScFvM?si=0igfmxqDcCjIHox9	well hey B it's Jamie D me here welcome back to the channel honey listen I want to get into some things and what I want to talk about is this teacher over on Tik Tok who has his students taking down his braids I guess he has a hair appointment of some sort and I want to get into it um I've been saying it swarm all around social media but I have not actually gotten a chance to really check it out wholeheartedly so we're about to do that together okay make sure that you guys are indeed coming into the video  you are liking up the channel okay subscribing to the channel as well if you're not subscribed and make sure that you're cutting on your notification Bells okay so without further Ado let us go ahead and hop into this video to see exactly what uh this teacher has to say about this um let's check it out stream my students helping me take my hair out there was quite the discourse in the chat which had people saying this was inappropriate and other people saying this was completely fine there was nothing wrong with what I was doing and  people were just making it weird so of course I had to bring this issue to the big stage I would like to represent myself in this case your honor if I may number one for little context I had a hair appointment immediately after school and I needed my hair taken out beforehand I would have taken it out the night before but that Friday we had a camera crew coming in to shoot a promotional video and I was one of the ones being interviewed so I had to look presentable so I didn't take my hair out I didn't have the time to do it  all myself cuz it would have taken me forever so naturally I asked about four or five of my over over a 100 best friends to assist me in taking my hair out and they all agreed number two this was at the end of class this week we were doing stem fair presentations since it was Friday and all of my students did an excellent job on their stem fair projects and presentations I told them if we get one solid presentation in this class I'll end class a little early and they can have fun and play basketball  darts or be on their phones or whatever and during that time my team would help me take my hair out a couple of these were students from my class but others were students from other classes I would all of them a pass at the beginning of the class period requesting their assistance 10 minutes before dismissal I told the teachers only send them if all of their work was completed and they had good behavior they all met the criteria so 10 minutes before dismissal they showed up for their job my next point I  like to make is if I was a female teacher those people wouldn't be in the comments saying oh this is weird this is inappropriate cuz me personally I don't think there's anything weird about this people are saying oh that's too intimate to me it's literally just hair it doesn't have to be weird some people have never had cool teachers in the shows I personally believe that building authentic relationships with students is Paramount in being an Effective Teacher I make sure my students know and can  feel that I care about them beyond the schoolwork and all the stuff that I have to make them do I take the time to get to know my students outside of academics because caring for the whole child is what's important some of these students have been with me since I was was a substitute 4 years ago they see me as a big brother or a father figure as some of them say and me I don't want kids of my own so all of these kids are literally my children and in case you're wondering about their parents most of  them follow me on social media and always talk about my videos with their kids they always tell me that they're so grateful that their kids have someone like me in their life and my admin they're well aware of my social media presence and they love my videos to me this is just another wholesome moment that I'm having with my kids that I was fortunate enough to catch on film since I'm a science teacher one thing that I teach my students about is symbiosis symbiosis deals with the relationships between organisms the type of  relationship that I like to Foster in my class is mutualism or mutualistic relationship which means both organisms benefit from The Exchange so when my students have good behavior complete all their assignments and do everything that a scholar is supposed to do I reward them with downtime and just time to just be a kid be on their phones play games gossip so on and so forth my students and I work hard and we play harder I'm fortunate enough to have students that feel safe and comfortable around me safe  to come to me with their problems their frustrations they come to me seeking guidance and wisdom or come to me simply to chill and hang out because they know that they have a safe space to be themselves around me what I strive to do as an educator is be the teacher I wish I had grown up I strive to be the teacher that makes my inner child happy someone that my inner child would be proud of I want to be the teacher that my students reflect back on 20 30 years down the line and think like dang that  teacher I had in middle school he was the no further questions your honor so let me know your thoughts in the comments you think this was inappropriate or people are making something out of nothing and although you are entitled to your opinion all I ask is that you be resp respectful thank you all right so y'all just got a chance to check out that video and you know when I first saw it um my initial thought was like oh this is so inappropriate like what the hell does he think he doing and you know after I  listened to this video just now um nothing has changed I still feel the same goddamn way I felt the first time you could play however much classical music you want to play and talk as soft as you want to talk but in my personal this is uh inappropriate um I feel like everything that he said he was on point with um you know the relationships between students and teachers but then also when you allow students to get this comfortable in spaces it could lead to inappropriate behavior or misunderstandings of some sort um in my  personal and you know he talks about you know I feel like a lot of you people may have never had a cool teacher and I understand that but then at the same time a lot of people have had cool teachers in the school and a lot of times not all but quite a bit of the times those cool teachers have been caught up in rumors of them doing inappropriate things with students so why would you want to put yourself in a position for that to possibly happen where somebody could put these allegations out there on you and then  some of the videos like this they use against you in court at some point you know what I'm saying um and you know how one would set it up you know in court or whatever they can all easily turn a simple video as a lot of people may view it like this one into something that's extremely like salacious or whatever we see it all the time with media but um yeah I I I'm just I understood what he was saying and it was really the soft classical music and you listening and it's like okay I see what you're saying but no my dog  like that's still inappropriate um to me I just can't and I'm not going to let my child take nobody hair down especially a stranger if you ain't going to pay like run my kid their coins what this supposed to be for extra credit or some something or something like what is we why what was the purpose of even filming this and putting this off on social media and see the other thing for me is it's the students identity what if I'm a parent who don't post my child on social media and what if I'm trying to you know  conceal the school that my child goes to and you're over here putting them on display on social media like I kind of feel way about that you know even though he tried to you know answer that too and say most of my students or some of my students parents know that I put them on social media yeah I hear you say that but do we know that those children's parents know that you put them on social media you see what I'm saying um I probably would have felt the way if I would have saw that video and that was  my child in the video like what the like explain this situ why you got my child taking your hair down like what is that about you ain't give me no call ahead of time I understand it was like at the last few minutes of class and these are some of the good students some of my best students are the ones that I had come and they were so great in school they were so fantastic that I chose them to take my hair down like m I feel like that's still giving a bit of tacky in my personal I do feel like um  in my personal it was just it was inappropriate I understand that you're on crunch time and I understand that you have a hair appointment and things that you need to get done but I also feel like you should have did it yourself okay I hate to say it like I mean or just pay a five pay the five if you can afford to pay the five pay the five and just have somebody just had a person take your hair down on you get there to get your hair done you know um it did you know as I I mean to me it did kind of look a bit innocent as  I'm watching and I'm listening to him talk you know um but at the same time as innocent as it may have seem with the young ladies taking the hair down it still seemed a bit inappropriate especially for you to want to film it for social media and put them on display like that's my biggest thing like what if somebody's trying not to let everybody know what school they child attends and you got they ass all on social media like did you get clearance for that was there a letter that sent that was sent home for the parents that  was an approval of oh hey um can we get your permission you know sometimes what we like to do is we like to film um you know Tik toks and just want to get your approval that it's okay for your child to be filmed on Tik Tok like I ain't like that um and then another thing he said that a lot of my students see me as a big brother this that that and the other um that's a lot that's not all you don't know how those kids may see you you know a lot of times I do feel like you have older people teachers and stuff  who are just trying to be kind to you know the students or whatnot and they may take that kindness in a different type of way it's been plenty of times I know when I was in school around their age I would hear some of my friends and others have a crush on one of the handsome teachers in school or whatever not that the teacher will ever cross the line with them but you know doing little stuff like this make them feel like oh I probably got a chance or whatever ain't no telling what's going on with these  people heads so in these in these kids heads I just feel like when it's a situation like this in my personal I just um let's lower these type of conversations from happening by not engaging in this type of stuff I mean you know that's just like I just I don't know y'all I I mean I understand how people want to water it down and say oh you know it's just hair it's really not that big of a deal like it's not that deep but as soon as y'all come out with something soon as something happen or pop off y'all will be using this very  video as a reference to explain said person's poor Behavior you know what I'm saying like y'all should have known when y'all saw this D if this man got caught up in some stuff in the past or anything in the future this is going to be a video used to reference any allegations like you know and then I feel like I know you're trying to be you know a great person to these students a teacher that cares about them outside of school and all of that and I get that and I do think we need teachers like that but at  the same time I feel like if you're if you got them taking your hair down in class what other things do you have them doing that makes them feel a bit too comfortable to where if it came down to a situation of getting themselves or or you out of trouble they'll like they may just throw some allegations out there on you and then now you're having to defend yourself like I just yeah I can't let it fly for me you know I mean but if that's what everybody else feels and that's how y'all Rock like it's not that deep it's just hair  and if you people that are saying it's just hair have children and you feel like you'll be okay with then cool um if you're a person that probably don't have no kids and you looking at it like hey you know um I think nothing's wrong with that well then maybe when you have your child you might feel the same or you might feel differently I know me as a parent I don't want no like that okay I don't want my child taking your hair down okay I feel like you can be a friend to a student and also have clear  clear lines for them to know that I'm your teacher okay don't get too friendly with me think you going to come over here and take my hair down or none of that like it's a way to be cool and then it's also a way to you know draw the line just like you know as being a parent knowing that you are you know in a position of authority but also at the same time like not being too um I guess uh I don't want to say harsh but harsh of a lack of lack of better word not being too distant with your kid that  they can't have honest conversations with you and all of that so it's just like really I I just I for me as a parent I would not want my child taking down a teacher's hair uh male or female okay um son or daughter meaning teacher meaning whether the teacher is a woman whether the teacher is a man whether my child is a girl but what I don't want them participating in that and I damn sure don't want nobody putting my child on social media as you're sitting there what it looks like your School logo on  it so people know like I mean I think that's my biggest issue and that's crazy because it's really bigger than them taking down the hair in a sense it's like like how you know these parents really want their child on camera and then it being on display where they child go to school at like I don't know I don't really like this but I'm going let y'all do what y'all want to do cuz y'all going to do it do that anyway cuz how y'all is hello but y'all leave y thoughts in comments down below and let me know whether you felt like it was  that big of a deal whether you felt like it wasn't a big that big of a deal and keep in mind this my personal my personal ain't your personal okay and that's okay don't be trying to attack me girl for my personal cuz I don't see stuff the way that you do understand and I'm probably never going to see it the same way but that's just where we at all right so you guys leave your thoughts and comments down below I'm Jamie that's me uh follow me on Instagram and Twitter at Jamie that's me and I will catch you  guys in the next one bye-bye my city

First year at five new drone video shows the scope of some of the damage in Tallahassee after the area this morning, damaging homes, causing power outages and leaving at least one person dead. Local officials say there's a strong chance that tornadoes touched down up there, though the National Weather Service has yet to confirm that FOX 13's Evan Moon has been  surveying the damage and is in the newsroom with more. Evan, Haley, as you said, we have learned one woman has been killed in those powerful storms. The Leon County Sheriff's Office, which does include Tallahassee, said a tree fell on her home. Governor DeSantis now issuing a state of emergency for 12 counties up there, starting around 4 a.m, the National Weather Service issued multiple warnings for possible tornadoes, telling people to seek immediate shelter. Wind gusts got above 70mph near hurricane force  winds, bringing down power damaging homes. The windows were like shaking a little bit and the, wind was like howling. You could hear it and I knew it was close. So I went into my bathroom and I watched the lights like, slowly start to flicker. And then they finally went out. Tallahassee officials told students to stay home from school as the worst of it blew through. A Florida State University student who studies meteorology says she woke up to howling wind. It was it was scary. And a lot of other  meteorology majors with me who lived in that area had said the same thing, there's a lot of tree damage for sure. Something I can probably compare to Michael or Hermine that had hit in 2018 and 2016. I've lived here my whole life. I'm born and raised in Tallahassee, so I have lived through these experiences, mess around with over here, she says. Floridians don't always take storm warning seriously enough. I feel like a lot of people end up letting their guard down, and so I feel like that we put these enhanced risks  out in the National Weather Service, puts these enhanced risks out to let you know that this is still a possibility. The than 66,000 homes without power. They say restoration will possibly take through the weekend. And among the damage the Florida State University baseball stadium and circus tent. My heart breaks for the students that are in the circus because I know that they're probably really upset about this, and I know that the damage is going to take a while to clean up again. Unfortunately,  one death reported so far. Hopefully we don't hear of any more. The National Weather Service put out the latest update that they are taking damage surveys as we speak in multiple counties, to assess 	Center			Conservative	105
K8	https://youtu.be/VNmkgMWVm1Q?si=RNztKKd1_HIaHGh4	what's going on guys it's Greg here AKA NY prepper it is Thursday April 4th 2024 and I have an emergency alert to share with you guys right now it is 15:30 eastern time here in the United States and we currently have US nuclear forces on high alert we have two presidential doomsday planes in the air this afternoon and we also have some B2 stealth bomb that were spotted over Central Missouri getting aerially refueled so what you're looking at here is a live flight tracker and you can see here one presidential doomsday plane  over Kansas and it was flying off the coast of Corpus Christie earlier this afternoon for a long period of time and it was doing the same thing just two days ago and also over here we have another presidential doomsday plane that took off from DC and it went to Ohio and now it's turning around and coming back this is actually where Wright Patterson Air Force Base is in Dayton Ohio which is like the area 51 of the eastern US here we have a US nuclear war command and control plane flying over Western  North Carolina heading towards Tennessee and we also have a nuke sniffer plane these planes are responsible for detecting radiation in the atmosphere and it's over Nebraska somewhere right now eastern Nebraska and it went off of the flight tracker so it turned its transponder off so this is very very concerning two presidential doomsday planes nuclear war command and control plane and then the nuke sniffer and then this is where the B2 stealth bomber was getting aerially refueled near oage Beach Missouri you can see it  was looping here really low close to Lake of the Ozarks and Warsaw Missouri and I actually have a picture from a subscriber who sent me this in the Lake of the Ozarks region so you can see the B2 stealth bomber flying behind the aerial refueler so this is extremely concerning it means our nuclear forces are on high alert right now okay to have a B2 stealth bomber getting aerially refueled over the continental US is extremely unusual unless they're doing some type of an exercise and two presidential doomsday  planes in the air at the same time is also very very unusual and I think this is because of the situation with Iran and Israel isra assassinated the commander of the irgc cuds force responsible for operations in Syria and Lebanon several days ago in an air strike on the Iranian consulate building in Damascus Syria the entire consulate was leveled by this Israeli air strike and guys embassies and consulates are considered the territory of that country so that's the equivalent of Israel launching a missile into Iran  okay so this is very serious Iran has issued multiple threats saying they're going to respond harshly that they reserve the right to an equal response they sent a message to the UN Security Council saying that they're preparing an equal response and that it's going to be harsh we've already seen people evacuating from various parts of Israel incl cluding Tel Aviv because Tel Aviv is the economic Center of Israel and I shared some footage last night of just hundreds and hundreds of people leaving  from Tel Aviv stuck in traffic okay so this is an extremely serious situation we also have some very very serious words coming from Russia today so the Kremlin spokesman Demitri Pesco of told reporters today that relations between NATO and Russia have now slipped to the level of direct confrontation and said that NATO was already involved in the conflict surrounding Ukraine and continues to move towards our borders and expand its military infrastructure towards our borders wow guys very very concerning  and Russian Deputy foreign minister Alexander grushko said in an interview with Sputnik today that the situation in the Russia NATO relations has been deteriorating predictably and deliberately and communication channels have been reduced to a critically low level he also said that macron's words on possibly sending troops to Ukraine were unacceptable he said as a result of The Adventurous actions of even one or two NATO member states the Ukrainian crisis could go beyond its Geographic boundaries and reach a completely  different scale wow guys very strong words there and Israel's Ministry of Health has summoned all Hospital managers to a meeting today to prepare for the threats from Iran Hospital managers are asked to ensure adequate Staffing this weekend this update was sponsored by my Patriot Supply guys my Patriot Supply has brought back their 25% discount on their three-month

and Israeli  news2 says that Israel understands that there will be an Iranian response and since Terror attacks through Iranian emissaries are unsuccessful Iran will try to hit Israel directly from their territory and Israel has told us officials that it will respond to any Aran aggression after days of threats from Iran this was reported by Al Arabia so Israel telling the US it will respond to Iran okay so this could spiral out of control very very quickly and that's why we have these b2s in the air right now  that's why we have multiple doomsday planes in the air right now and nuclear war command and control planes because at any second our forces could be called on to defend Israel and attack Iran and denuclearize them demilitarize them bombard all their bases use bunker Busters use Earth penetrating nuclear warheads to annihilate all of their missile bases they have under mountains this is all planned already guys the now with Biden in control I don't know how far he would go in implementing some of  these plans but you know due to to his reelection he may be motivated to go all the way and launch a full-scale decapitation strike on Iran so this way he could reelect himself because the US would be in a time of war and all of the Israeli army soldiers have received orders to remain on their bases this weekend amid Iranian threats against Israel with Israeli fighter pilots and air defense operators being recalled from leave and we know know that there's three retaliation options for Iran the first one is they  can use their proxies in Lebanon Syria and Iraq to launch missiles and drones and Rockets the other option is that Iran launches ballistic missiles directly at Israel from Iranian territory and the other option is that they try to infiltrate Israeli territory with proxy forces and the Israeli government said GPS signals are now being jammed over the country to interfere with Iranian missile and drone guidance especially around Tel Aviv which is Israel's economic Hub and the Israeli National Insurance Institute has allegedly been  hacked the data of 8 million insured Israelis including their personal information their bank account data their residents are now at the disposal of hackers and there's been intense fighting going on in Southeastern Iran between Iranian security forces and Sunni militants in the Iranian Port City of chabahar reports indicate that there are multiple casualties on both sides and fighting began last night when several Iranian weapons Depot and bases came under attack by the Sunni militants the militants have claimed that they  captured the irgc naval headquarters and at least five irgc facilities including one in the city of Peru as well as several key roadways in the region okay so most likely this is being funded by Israel and the West they're definitely helping these militants to carry out these attacks in Southeastern Iran to open up another front for Iran to worry about and US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin threatened Israel today saying if we don't see the changes we need to see from Israel there will be changes in  our policy wow guys that is so arrogant and Anthony blinkin is actually a Jew himself and he is always throwing Israel under the bus so if that's not proof that we're living in the end times I don't know what other proof you need all these countries attacking Israel now all these proxies Hamas Hezbollah now Iran is going to launch an attack on Israel our own government here in America is going against Israel okay this is a huge sign of the end times including everything going on with Russia Russia  has moved tanks to the border of Israel guys they have moved tanks in Syria to the Golan Heights right on the border of Israel okay that is extremely concerning and if you read in the Bible the Book of Ezekiel chapter 38 and 39 it talks about the Gog Magog War which involves a Russian Alliance a Russian Le Alliance of Middle Eastern countries and North African countries and they go against Israel they try to attack Israel and they build up a huge Army right on the border of Israel and just before they  invade God just completely wipes out all of the armies okay they're not even allowed to go into Israel okay so all these countries that are attacking Israel they're going to receive punishment and severe judgment from the Lord okay and a neutron reactor in kke Ukraine was deener energized due to the shelling of carke last night during which four people died this was reported by the Ukrainian State nuclear regulatory inspectorate the emergency power supply system operated normally an emergency diesel generators were switched on the  radiation situation at the site is within normal limits okay so a neutron reactor was deenergized last night in kke okay guys Neutron radiation is no joke that's the worst kind of radiation okay because you can't really block it with much besides water and concrete okay it'll pass through everything it's even more dangerous than regular gamma radiation okay and one of the last two remaining external power lines connecting the giant Ukrainian nuclear power plant the zapia nuclear power plant to the  Ukrainian power grid was damaged last night due to Russian shelling according to Ukrainian Energy company an aatam Russia is claiming that it was Ukraine's fault and Ukraine is blaming Russia so this power plant normally has like a dozen external power lines and that's gone down to just two remaining and now one of the two has been disconnected for some reason probably destroyed compromised somehow so now this entire power plant with six nuclear reactors that's like six Chernobyl guys okay six Chernobyl if this thing were to melt  down all right this is very very serious if that last remaining power line goes down this entire power plant is going to have to run off of diesel generators to keep everything going so the nuclear Fuel and the spent fuel doesn't overheat and melt down and obviously in a war zone that's not easy to do because you need massive diesel generators to keep a plant like this running and so it's going to guzzle Fuel and you know especially with Russia in control we know how good Russia is at managing nuclear power plants not too good if you  look at the situation with Chernobyl 30 plus years ago and Ukraine and Nero the Ukrainian power company has introduced temporary power outages in six parts of Ukraine they're going to shut the electricity down from 1,800 to 2200 every single night and the regions affected are Deno Petra donet zapia kirov rod pava and sui and the reason for these restrictions is the lack of sufficient generating capacity in the system after recent Russian attacks on the Ukrainian power grid and Poland said that they're not going to be  participating in the battles in Ukraine said polish prime minister Donald Tusk at the moment I can repeat what I told macron what I told other leaders including President Biden Poland does not foresee direct participation in the war on the territory of Ukraine I want to just update you guys on the situation in Taiwan with these earthquakes there was a 6.1 magnitude earthquake last night right offshore from the Fukushima power plant in Japan the one that melted down and detonated 10 plus years ago and over a thousand people have been  injured in the Taiwan Quakes and 10 people killed and what you're looking at here is some Russian presidential Doom day planes and nuclear war command and control planes that went East to Siberia and the urals late last night here we have a tu 214 sbus that's Putin's doomsday plane a tu 214 Sr and a tu 20430 which are nuclear war command and control planes and we have a massive amount of GPS jamming and electronic navigation jamming going on in the Middle East not just in Israel which Israel is doing on purpose to scramble  guidance of any Iranian missiles but apparently there's now jamming going on in the Persian Gulf in the Red Sea in the Arabian Sea as you can see here in this picture Okay so this could be Iran and its proxy forces setting up Jammers here to uh scramble any kind of uh Allied Forces GPS systems and here we have some video footage of the supreme leader of Iran the Ayatollah CI making a statement at the funeral procession for the irgc officers that were killed in the Israeli air strike in Damascus so this is very  serious guys for the Ayatollah kamani to come out of his bunker and lead a funeral procession for these irgc officers is extremely extremely serious okay and here we have a picture of all the aftershocks that have been ongoing off the coast of Taiwan after the 7.7 earthquake I mean these aftershocks are still ongoing guys okay dozens and dozens of aftershocks over the last day or so over 4.0 magnitude too and then here's the location of that 6.1 off the coast of Japan off the coast of Fukushima where the nuclear power  plant is and France denies Russian claims that it expressed willingness to hold Dialogue on Ukraine or to discuss possible peace negotiations when the two countries defense ministers spoke on Wednesday according to Reuters it is not true a French government Source said at no moment did we show any willingness to Dialogue on Ukraine or negotiations or anything like that and Dimitri pesov the Kremlin spokesman said that although there is currently no plan for a conversation between Putin and macron  Putin is apparently open to dialogue pesov said this after Sergey shu's conversation with the French defense minister which was said to have taken place on the initiative of the French side pretty interesting and a NATO official said Ukrainian drone strikes may have disrupted 10 to 15% of Russia's oil refinery capacity okay which is nothing guys 10 to 15% I mean that is just a drop in the bucket for Russia okay this is just more Western BS propaganda trying to make it seem like Ukraine is winning so they can  justify not giving Ukraine what they need 10 to 15% is just nothing and Russian foreign minister Sergey lavro said today that there are obvious Ukrainian traces in the Moscow Concert Hall attack okay so the Russian government is continuing to say that Ukraine is responsible for this Concert Hall attack we had Nikolai petrusev Putin's best bud and also another uh former FSB agent and former FSB director just like Putin said the other day that Ukraine was hiring terrorists in Tajikistan to carry out operations on  Russian soil okay so it's just absolutely crazy guys and the Russian Baltic Fleet is organizing command and staff exercises, 1500 soldiers and 80 pieces of equipment 10 ships and boats and support units are taking part in the exercises according to the Russian military the aim of the exercises is to increase the combat Readiness of the Baltic Fleet now I've been showing you guys the last couple of days all the p8 Poseidon sub Hunters that have been active off the coast of kenrad and now we know why because the Russian Baltic  Fleet is going to be doing some big drills here in the coming days okay to increase combat Readiness isn't that interesting that the Baltic Fleet is increasing combat readiness at the same time as bellarus has put their entire military on combat alert and they've moved mechanized brigades with hundreds of tanks and armored vehicles to just within a few miles of the Lithuanian border isn't that interesting that's not a coincidence guys okay Russia and bellarus are planning something in the baltics I think they're going to try to  go for the capital of Lithuania vilnus and that's why Russia's putting their Baltic Fleet on combat Readiness okay and what you're looking at here is a US reconnaissance plane that was patrolling kenrad last night and a US House vote on Ukraine Aid isn't likely until at least mid April and possibly later with speaker Mike Johnson still searching for ways to soften opposition from Republican hardliners so basically the Ukrainian front lines are going to collapse in the spring and Russia's going to make a huge  breakthrough I think they're going to go for Odessa I think they're going to go for potentially Kei I think they're going to potentially go for kke we have multiple Russian allies telling their citizens to get out of kke and Odessa and keev Kazakhstan China and some other Russian Allied countries have told their citizens through local embassies in Ukraine to get out out of kke get out of Odessa and Ukraine has been fortifying Odessa and keev and Deno Petros like crazy because they know that Russia's going to smash the front lines  and penetrate and go all the way to these cities potentially all the way to the Deno river which would be catastrophic okay that would be a disaster and it's all the West's fault because they didn't give Ukraine what they needed at the proper time time okay when Ukraine had the Russian forces on the run in haran and in Kens remember when the Russians were literally running they were dropping all their equipment and just fleeing for their lives that was the time to give Ukraine all the equipment that we're giving them now  okay all the leopard tanks all the long range missiles the f-16s they should have already had that and millions of shells to back it up and thousands of missiles and that would have been the opportunity for a Counterattack not wait another year to start a Counterattack and give Russia an entire year to build these massive fortifications that were inpenetrable okay the West is messing around and Russia is laughing we're not United we're not organized we're not determined our societies are not on a war footing  while Russia is on a war footing you know everybody makes fun of Russian soldiers how they don't have anything to eat they don't have boots their rifles don't work they have two weeks of training but guess what Russia's getting it done okay they're getting it done and we're not we're losing because instead of doing what needs to be done like Russia's doing we're messing around okay and we're making fun of Russia and Russian forces and you know laughing about them but they're actually getting the job done and we're not okay that  doesn't mean that I support Russia or I'm pro- Russia or anything like that in the war in Ukraine it's just the reality of the situation okay and you know the same thing is happening now with these f-16s okay it's just like with the leopard tanks they thought last year oh we're going to give Ukraine leopards we're going to give them M1 abrs we're going to give them Bradley's and that's going to somehow miraculously turn the war around and they're going to be able to smash through miles and miles of  Defense lines with those you know Wonder Weapons basically you know well they didn't have air cover they didn't have enough ammunition and because of that the those leopard tanks were basically destroyed by Russian drones Mill millions and millions of dollars worth of Western tanks destroyed by Cheap Russian drones because the West has no plan they have no strategy and Russia knows it and they're going to take advantage of it okay they know that our leaders are soft and weak and they're more preoccupied  with climate change and stuff like that rather than doing what needs to be done okay and they're going to take advantage of it and I'm telling you guys this spring and this summer we're going to see potentially two fronts opening up we're going to have Russia launching a massive new offensive against Ukraine and then bellarus is going to try to go into Lithuania because they know we're weak they've sent several missiles into Poland that were not shot down Russia sent four missiles into Poland and they  were not shot down NATO forbade Poland from shooting down those missiles they said Poland you're not allowed to shoot those missiles down okay so they know NATO's weak and they're going to take advantage of it and belgrad the city in Russia close to Ukraine has been shelled every single day for the past three weeks and Russia's defense Ministry claimed on April 4th that its forces downed three Ukrainian drones over belgrad and two more over the Tula oblast Finland is permanently extending its border closure with Russia that's  crazy guys Finland has already shut their entire border down with Russia and now they're permanently extending that until further notice basically and the Romanian prime minister said that he supports the the idea of unifying mova with Romania either within the EU or through other means wow and just the other day the Romanian parliament passed a law allowing the Romanian military to protect Romanians in other parts of the world and in mova over 50% of the people are Romanian citizens okay so Romania is  obviously concerned about what's going on in Ukraine now and they afraid that if Russia smashes the front lines which they will they're going to go for Odessa and then they could potentially go for mova after that and from April 2nd to April 3rd on the Polish border with bellus there were 416 attempts of illegal entry into Poland recorded by the Polish border guards it seems as though bellarus is beginning another hybrid attack on Poland by releasing Middle Eastern migrants and the US Britain and France opposed A Russian  drafted un Security Council statement that would have condemned an attack on Iran's Embassy in Syria by Israel and NATO countries decided to create an alliance mission in Ukraine according to the foreign minister of Poland secorski the creation of the mission does not mean direct entry into the conflict but it does mean that we will now be able to use NATO's coordination training and planning capabilities to support Ukraine in a more coordinated way and NATO Secretary General Jen Stenberg said we are not talking about turning  NATO into a Global Alliance NATO remains an alliance of North America and Europe and the prime minister of Ukraine met with the prime minister of lvia and apparently lvia is ready to allocate a quarter of a percent of their GDP to Ukraine for helping them in the war and Polish president Andre dudas said all NATO countries should Implement a clear and transparent policy of strengthening security and he said this at the 75th anniversary of NATO he said Security in NATO is a collective security we all  need to have well equ equipped functioning armies that is why I propose that the level of minimum spending in the North Atlantic Alliance countries be raised to 3% of GDP and we know that Poland has raised their spending to 4% of GDP making them the highest spend in NATO on military equipment and the Armenian prime minister pinan went to Brussels for the NATO 75th Anniversary meeting and apparently he's going to be meeting the US Secretary of State and the head of the European commission there so that's pretty interesting looks  like Armenia is trying to get into NATO and get into the EU and Germany will immediately initiate a search for Patriot air defense systems for Ukraine they're going to be looking all over the world including in Europe for Patriot air defense systems they can send to Ukraine and some Western luxury brands have suspended their operations in the Russian Market permanently and have left themselves with empty boutiques in the most exclusive locations in Russian cities salons have been closed for the past two  years in hopes of ending the war and returning normal trade relations between Russia and the West now the Giants of the luxury goods markets are starting to give up and are breaking or not renewing lease agreements of their boutiques in Russia so another blow to Russian society and secret CIA bases are preparing for escalation against the south and east of Venezuela from the esao region of Guyana according to Venezuelan president Nicholas Maduro he's a communist by the way according to Maduro the president of Guyana does not  govern Guyana and that Guyana is governed by the US military Southern command the CIA and Exxon Mobile and the US Army plans to deploy a new medium-range missile launcher in the Asia Pacific region by the end of the year that could act as a deterrent against China according to General Charles Flynn so that's pretty interesting and I want to show you guys some flight paths here in South Korea here we have a US awax plane and a US rq4 Global Hawk reconnaissance plane and they were patrolling the border of North Korea  South Korea last night and I want to show you guys some footage of these Ukrainian defense lines that are going up all along the front lines Ukraine is scrambling to build defense lines you can see all these dragons teeth here and they've also been digging uh trenches anti-tank trenches which you're going to see in a moment but this line is definitely not as thick as the suran line that the Russians built hopefully Ukraine will fortify this line even more but you can see actually this massive trench here so  they're digging these huge anti-tank trenches these are basically to stop tanks so tanks can't go through that trench because it's too deep so when they go in the front of the tank gets stuck and they have to get pulled out by either another tank or a recovery vehicle so they're just building these trenches and then they have some Dragon's Teeth there but you can see that the dragon's teeth are not particularly long okay if you remember the footage of the Russian defense lines these dragons teeth would span for miles  and miles miles I mean the Russians really built massive defense lines but again Western media didn't show that because they wanted you to think that Russia's not coordinated that they're not trained well that they don't know what they're doing you know that their soldiers don't have food while Russia built a successful defense line to stop the Ukrainian counter offens if they succeeded in that they got the best of the West they beat us okay and the Western media continued to make it seem like the Biden Administration and these  NATO leaders are like Geniuses you know and that they're going to strategically weaken Russia which is not happening okay Russia's economy is still functioning the sanctions were useless they're continuing to mobilize and they're actually gaining momentum now you have to remember the more territory that Russia occupies they can use that territory to feed their War Machine okay they've occupied thousands of square miles of Ukrainian farmland and important cities that they can now plug into their economy okay so that's  the latest breaking news that I have I will be back later with another update on the situation with Israel but it looks like any hour any day now Iran is going to launch this massive strike on Israel and we have US nuclear forces on high alert for that today so I'll monitor the situation and I will update you later and until then take care God bless and don't forget the 3ps prepare practice and persevere guys the world is getting Crazier by the day we're on the verge of World War III the US is drowning in  trillions of dollars

K55	https://youtu.be/l5Fb_TVgkRM?si=YJiZU1f3dT2gUauV	every time I come my brother be retired Highway Patrol 33 years every time I come since we served her this every time I come over here my brother escorts me over here M so I'm scared for my safety and she's crazy she's the type that will say that I hit her H the cops have been coming over here about I bet they've been coming over here two three times a week there different things that she's done destroyed my house did you see the riding on the wall no the mattresses were in the way the girls were even on  my side at the restraining order place once I showed them my video her spray paint in my drive my car for oh my God I can't believe they're not arresting her no ma'am they're not now it's going to be even worse she's going to retaliate even more every time she gets served with something she tears something up breaks something in the house see how she spray painted the house I got her on film I'm telling you stop painting my house how long you been with the S uh the scambia county huh how long you been with County about 10 years  do you ever know Bane Matthews he retired he might have retire I mean was retired before you hired on we are here in Escambia County Florida because this kindly old man care for a coach for a no thank you opened his home to a young woman when he finally asked for rent she became abusive and destructive while working on an eviction which takes time A judge has helped escalate the process by issuing an injunction against stalking due to her behavior effective immediately stuff real quick [Music] [Music]  hey got that paper I think he gave me the wrong [Music] one [Music] should be the non written one yeah this one I receive a handwritten one what's that why did I receive a handwritten one uh sometimes the judges do that then before they get transposed on the [Music] computer okay so there was yeah see the differ [Music] in so you still have the court date on the [Music] eight there is that [Music] okay okay so on the so the court date in the meantime the is it's going to be a temporary restraining order okay um so  there is priv actions on here listed no contact among him is one of them and then can't be within 500 ft of this address so how much stuff do you have here um well okay right there in the driveway is where his RV was and he moved it so he could go stay somewhere else and how much stuff do you have here though cuz you can't be here for the judge part of the terms that you guys work out on the eth is he was just told to F umig mhm whenever this was delivered so this is only temporary um that's why he took his  RV yeah until we work this out so what I'm saying though is this is temporary okay eviction is permanent okay up until the court date these terms are in effect at least until the court date and part of what the judge says is is the not within 500t well that is my address too that does make sense what do you [Music] mean took all my stuff in go like he took his RV so un unfortunately I can't give any good input on that but judge says you have to be out of this house okay until at least the or when  now does it say right now yes where when we when I mean on the paper where does it say when it's ordered it say done and ordered order and adjudicated judges saying you cannot be within here okay so got to be a certain amount of time long enough to get your stuff and go okay and that's not a problem mhm I just want to know what you know what time I should be there's really no time frame I said it's it's when you get served you have to get yourself and Vac for the temporary say that where exactly whenever you get serve and have  to make it R W because it's you can't be within 500 here so once you are Ser saying what it doesn't have a Time correct so does that mean 24-hour notice no it's once once you're served technically I mean and like said that I'm not trying to be a dick about it but technically you are violating in terms of a restra or by being here right this second so like I said it's not an issue of getting all your stuff just have to get it and go that's unrealistic though what do you mean just it's just un unfortunately that's  the terms of of a temporary or permit retraining order or in this case the injunction for against stalking so how much stff do you have here that you need to get out um it'll probably take me 3 hours to get out okay def can't be that long so I like I'll try to shorten the time but I need to make some phone calls cuz I'm not just going to get in my car and start driving to nowhere well in the meantime we going inside grab some things and you have to get out no problem I need to make a couple phone calls first okay well I need we  need to pack up a few things and make the phone calls in the process do I let's see that sounds great and good I'm going to do that um but I'm going to sit down and make a couple phone calls first I don't have that much stuff well how much stuff do you have um I'm trying to work with you here of of to trying to get all your stuff out so you don't have to deal with anything later on right um same so I mean honestly if I was I don't really have much more than like some clothes and a couple dressers  you know let's let's St inside and work on that I'm going St outside and make a phone call so I know where I'm going but let's step inside and pack your stuff otherwise we don't have to give you the chance to get all your stuff out I'm I'm trying to work with you here so if you want to make a phone call I'm fine with that let's go inside make phone call file an eviction it doesn't matter though that he can still file an eviction in the meantime the judge has ordered you out of this house okay so there's I said two options  we can come in here calling somebody first okay then you're not going to go go back inside one or two no CU I'm I'm not trying to be a jerk about it I don't think you can prevent me from getting my stuff or making a plan to have somewhere to go you're sitting here debating it with me as a problem I'm telling you to go inside pack your bag while you make a phone call to to call somebody make a plan and then and through with it it doesn't matter about plan you have to get your stuff and get out of the house that's  fine so but I'm a plan to know where I'm going before I get my stuff no that's not what happens that doesn't that sounds it doesn't sound very that doesn't make a whole lot of sense like no the judge says you have to be out of the house so you got to get your stuff get the house now or not I'm not going to sit here and be ignored so is that what you want to do because the other option is going to jail for making a plan yes if that's what you want to call it yes you use whatever word you want or word the  whatever way you want or use whatever phrase you want I don't care you're not getting out of the house so get yourself and get out of the house or you go to jail that's the two simple explanations to it this is a sered DVI signed by the judge okay you have to be at this house he says that's fine so we can go inside and get your stuff and get out or you can go to jail I'm not going to sit here and stand there and debate this with you at your door so are we going to go to jail or you get your stuff get  out CH I'm looking some things up okay I'm not here for you to look things up I know you're not but I like this this isn't definite so correct it's a temporary order until your court date so you have to be out until your court date so you can look up all you want that's fine but I'm not going to sit here and debate this with you in the doorway debate whether or not you know where I'm going you don't have a plan for me do you no that's and I'm not trying to be add it's not your problem right correct so the judge says you have  to be out of this house so you have to be out of this house okay but we're not getting out of the house so like I said we're not I'm not going to sit here all day and do this do you have resources sleep on the street I just want to know where I should go I don't care where you go all I'm doing is telling you that's not my problem though the judge says you have to be out of this house I'm here to tell you you have to be out of this house I'm trying to work with you on it and trying to get you get your stuff if you don't want to  get your stuff that's fine but you are going to leave this house that's fine but I'm going to make a plan first no please please oh you ain't got now yes I'm still here on

just want to make a plan for  somewhere to go okay so what tell me what happened he served okay the day before yesterday I got served with a court filing okay for a basically a court hearing uhhuh for um my roommate is filed stalking on me for anyways well today this officer come knocking on the door at the same time with my roommate okay but and told me that the judge ordered a temporary injunction okay and that I need to leave right away okay so so I told him okay well I need to make some plans some arrangements okay you know  um and basically he was like no you can't make any Arrangements you just have to get your stuff and get out who is she to you just a a good a friend that I helped out a long time ago um anyhow just someone I helped out through the knowing her and then she didn't want to pay rent and all the other stuff so I started talking about evicting her getting rid of her and she just got crazy later problem you know so I got on my phone to try to you know attempt to make some arrangements first right and he ended up  and just went from B door did you tell him you weren't going to be leaving right now I just said I wanted to make a plan first okay and so why didn't and I asked him if he had any resources like right make a place to okay all right well I guess he he was under the impression that you said something about you weren't going to be leaving today or at least right now and he said yeah you are you you need to get your stuff and you argued it for 10 or 15 minutes and then I guess you that when you got on your  phone um well while we were talking about it yeah okay and then what happened after you got on your phone he pushed his way in okay and tell me tell me the story of what happened from there I mean he pushed his way in I mean and tried to arrest me okay and what happened what did you do I mean did you turn around and let him put handcuffs on or I asked him not to and I asked the question that she's getting charged with this time uh the violation of the order cuz that's that's the whole reason we got into this  because she wouldn't get out and uh resisting officer so just two uh misers he's got a felony hanging over right now for ass salt and Battery on her stepdad yeah well they may bond for that then so like I said Steve uh uh Robert's a good friend of mine and he already told me says you know she's got such a past criminal record uhhuh that if she does anything yeah I got you no I have no idea and she'll have a bond I don't know if they're going to revoke her other one but they're she'll have a bond for this you got any questions can  I still make a plan for somewhere to go no you're going to go go to jail now why cuzz you fought with the deputy so how so what do you mean how so I mean how you you didn't do what he told you by gathering up your stuff and getting out of the house so you're violating the injunction and then when he came in and told you you're under arrest you didn't go quietly and peacefully you fought back so you get charged with violating the domestic violence injunction and resisting an officer that I just received mhm cuz that injunction says  you have to vacate the house right now and by not doing it you're violating that injunction wasn't even given the opportunity the same one that showed up to give it to me is the one the resting yeah because you weren't going to get your stuff I don't have a problem getting my stuff but you didn't do it you argued for a while and then you made a phone call I just had questions okay well you didn't need to ask questions you needed to get your stuff that's what he told you get your stuff and then you can ask  questions after you do that but you wanted to argue and make phone calls and that's that's why I was problem want to know where I'm you know make a plan on where I'm going whenever I pull out of here with my stuff okay all right um I'm going to go take care of this and then we'll head over to the jail and we'll have some we'll have a crime scen person take some pictures of the taser mark okay all right hang on a bit the suspect was charged with violating her court-ordered injunction against

K62	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmtFtWVrxFE	it's October 2015 a chilly day in Autumn John Brennan receives a weird phone call it seems to be coming from a stranger he hesitates a second then picks up hello John Brennan who is this you're a lucer if John Brennan hadn't been John Brennan this might have looked like an ordinary prank call but John Brennan happens to be one of the most powerful men on Earth the head of the CIA who is this how did you get this number it was so easy bro you're such a d what do you want I don't want anything I already own you how much  do you want we want $5 trillion the US government will classify this call as part of a larger conspiracy of identity theft harassment of government officials and cyber terrorism the caller will pay a heavy price for this moment of trollish Glory why you doing this we want you to stop bombing the middle least across the Atlantic and a house in the West Midlands of England a 15-year-old kid in his room the phone still in his hand he can't believe what he just did he calls himself craer and he loves to smoke weed in fact he's high  right now he's also the leader of krakas with Attitude he and his companions terrorized and embarrassed the US security apparatus to a near incomparable degree they leaked the personal data of police officers FBI agents and doj officials they hand delivered top secret documents to Julian Assange some of the most publicized activism attributed to Anonymous they call themselves Anonymous yeah it was actually them in part for the laws and this is their story this was political teenager Cyber attack hijacked the  computers of several us intelligence andity colletive called crackers with attitude 2008 in Virginia a different kid who only calls himself default he is a pretty typical American Teenager he loves soccer video games and his dog he often clashes with his father who works in the government at some point default starts cheating in his video games this gives him the first taste of using computers to do things that you're not supposed to exciting powerful things he starts learning all that he can about  how computers work and how to get them to bend to your will 2008 was an exciting time to get into hacking a decentralized activist group Anonymous was in its Heyday if you manag to get into their secret chats you got a front seat view of their actions Anonymous is one of the biggest online vigilante group members hack into companies and government now a worldwide and widely recognized hacking group hackers with a group Anonymous citizens of the world we have seen the erosion of VI process a cyber War anonymous  anonymous anonymous has struck again young default is is fascinated Anonymous embodies an exciting Spirit of Freedom through chaos they showed how you could force the whole world to pay attention without you having to leave your bedroom some Anonymous actions are political some are just trolling and default after tasting this very new kind of power is Keen to learn everything he can about hacking he starts to hack random websites just for the challenge of it just to see if he can but after hanging around anonymous's  chats for a while he starts to find the group well cringe for one thing it's crawling with FEDS people are getting arrested and it's tough to know who to trust Anonymous has become so big that vetting people becomes difficult there's tons of infighting and doxing since it's the only activist group most media Outlets know about Anonymous keeps getting credited for the work of other often more sophisticated hackers it's a mess so default gets involved with offshoot hacker groups one of them called Anon sec the group positions  itself as anti- Anonymous but similar to Anonymous Anon SE performs operations hacking initiatives that sometimes have a political purpose and sometimes are just as one might say in 2008 for the ls I hated recording that Anon SE is quite Advanced and default gets better and better at the game the group controls a botn net a botn net is essentially a large pack of infected computers under someone's control you can use those computers to further spread malware across the internet to make the botn net larger and  larger or you could for example attack a server with it in order to overload it default is tapping around Anon sex botnet and gets curious about what computers they've actually gotten under their control he finds that one is a server of the Canadian Medical School Windsor University suddenly default finds himself with direct access to the University's finances he pulls up records of students who owe the school money it all adds up to 9 4 million and at the bottom of the list something very tempting a delete all button how could  he not push it these people might you know really enjoy having their slate wiped clean as it were um if you look some of them ohe a substantial amount of money you know like 70,000 I think some people owed like upwards of like over 100 ,000 it's a lot of money you know what I'm saying it's just like Perpetual debt that sometimes it just lasts for decades so um just deleted everything I went into the PHP shell and just like sent everything to devnull just like shredded it so whatever I sent there is just not coming back this is  from the podcast darket Diaries they have a fantastic episode with default of course course this story poses some questions we tried asking the university if the dead stay deleted they did not answer but usually student loans have multiple on and offline and offside backups there should be hard copies of the student signed loan agreements however default feels like he's really doing something at the time there is a certain rush to committing a crime when it feels like doing the right thing other hackers might have used the  sensitive student information to make a profit there's actually a shadow industry worth billions surrounding our most sensitive

motivated by altruism rather than just curiosity as recently as 2014 beastiality was legal in Denmark other European countries Germany the UK Sweden had recently banned it what this meant for Denmark was an increase in animal sex tourism for years Danish animal rights activists tried to bring attention to this they called them dog brothel so sick it's so crazy and I had a dog so that really pissed me off just thinking about the  fact what if someone took my dog and that happened to my dog I would freak out so as default describes it he and other Anon hackers lend their technical skills to the animal rights movement so we I think we took down the official Denmark Government website and then we actually um defaced it you know and said did you know that your government allows beastiality and there's beastiality dens where people can go and pay money to do these things to animals and most of them are like people's pets they shut down  beastiality websites via dos attacks and tweet evidence of sexually mistreated animals the information reverberates around the world and is widely condemned Anonymous gets credit for Anon sex actions which deeply annoys default but it works in part due to the hacks more people know about Danish dog brothel they talk about them online protest them until the case winds up in Parliament in April 2015 Denmark finally bans beastiality while default is leveling up as a hacker he also becomes an early  adopter of crypto he accumulates a significant amount of Bitcoin more than 1,000 this would amount to a lot of money today somewhere around $40 million he keeps these Bitcoins on a hard drive in his room he also knows he's making powerful enemies so he gets a bit paranoid a bit fanatical with his opsac he never logs into his own Wi-Fi for one he uses a satellite dish to log into a free Dairy Queen Wi-Fi half a mile away he's always connecting through a tour note every time he turns off his devices he makes sure they're encrypted  when he turns them back on he has to wait 30 minutes for them to decrypt for the most part he never tells anybody what he is doing he knows he has a lot to lose ultim Ely it won't be enough back in May 2013 a 29-year-old us intelligence contractor also has a lot to lose he has his own home in Honolulu a loving girlfriend and a salary of over $200,000 per year but he's discovered a huge secret and it's too big to keep the US government has the ability to spy on pretty much any man woman child on Earth  who has coming into contact with a computer and this contractor unwittingly has helped make that technology possible he's haunted by this information and horrified that his government is violating its public civil rights so egregiously he knows that revealing this information to anyone a lawyer a judge or even Congress would be committing felonies so severe that he would spend a lifetime in prison he's worried he'll never see his family again and he doesn't know what consequences they'll encounter if he Blows the Whistle but he  has to do it he's been quietly collecting evidence of this secret for a while and he's just downloaded the last documents he tells his employer the US government that he needs a couple of weeks off to manage his epilepsy this buys him a bit of time to leave the country without arousing suspicion he chooses Hong Kong because he views it as a Bastion of free speech he believes it's one of the few places in the world that could and would protect him from the Wrath of the US government there he meets journalists Laura pyros and Glenn  Greenwald and delivers evidence of what used to be waved off as a conspiracy theory and so Edward Snowden becomes one of the most important whistleblowers of our modern time snowden's Revelations scandalize the world and Spark a long overdue debate about individual privacy versus National Security he inspires many Young Americans like default to take a good hard look at how their government functions default doesn't want to sit around and let surveillance happen to him he wants high-ranking intelligence officials to know what it  feels like to be spied upon to have their private information stored and distributed and to have it used against them this is when he teams up with the krakas with Attitude founded by kraka the kid who's always high leerer England 2015 in a housing estate on the outskirts of a sleepy former mining town there's not a lot to do except get high or go online in the case of 15-year-old kraka he spends his time doing both he's angry about corruption about surveillance but in particular about the US's involvement in  the Middle East he becomes especially focused on Palestine and sees the us as directly responsible for death and suffering in Gaza he decides to do something about it this was political we heard he was really angry about US foreign policy so he started a collective called crackers with attitude and then he hacked into sensitive documents online one of his first victims is James Clapper then the national director of intelligence of the Obama Administration Clapper one of the highest ranking members of the  intelligence Community had his phone number and address waiting to be found with just one Google search this provides kraker with enough information to hack into his email he posts proof of it on Twitter which catches defaults attention Kracker then gets the phone calls to clapper's house phone rerouted to the free Palestine movement default tweets his respect to kraka and the two start chatting Edward Snowden himself has given James Clapper a very special shout out in an interview with the German broadcaster Ard unfortunately  that interview was blocked from us and German television networks apparently the video is immediately taken down every time it's posted on YouTube so we'll only show the quotes visually I would say sort of the breaking point is seeing the Director of National Intelligence James Clapper directly lie under oath to Congress what we do not do is spy unlawfully on Americans or for that matter spy indiscriminately on the citizens of any country we only spy for valid foreign intelligence purposes as authorized by law with multiple layers  of oversight to ensure we don't abuse our authorities kraa and default are livid kraka and other hackers Loosely connected with CWA team up to Target more high-ranking members of the intelligence Community they want to embarrass them and to show them that they aren't as powerful as they think they are at the top of their list is John Brennan head of the CIA Brennan like Clapper has enough information online that he basically doxes himself kraa looks up his publicly posted phone number and finds out it's a  Verizon number he calls up Verizon's internal tech support and pretends to be an on-site technician who's having trouble helping a customer onsite tech support asks cracker for his employee code and he just makes one up on the spot it works the support technician provides KRA with access and suddenly he has has the account number the pin and John Brennan's private email address if you have just enough information on someone pieced together from different sources say their address and last four digits of their social security number  you can easily change the passwords on all kinds of accounts and take it over and that's exactly what kraka does with Brennan's AOL account once he's in the email account kraka gets Brennan's private cell number and shares it with default and so they start spam calling the director of the CIA relentlessly calling him and his family I told him he was a piece of sh basically like y are awful people like really like you're not doing any net positive things for the world you're just not John Brennan is freaked out  sure the calls are a little more than a prank but how could he know that at the time nobody knew who was behind the calls or what their intentions were Brennan has to lay low for a while in hiding with extra security details for himself and his family at the same time kraa's breach into Brennan's email gives him access to sensitive documents kraka first post screenshots on Twitter but then egged on by default and may be asking himself what would Snowden do he decides to hit up Wikileaks Julian Assange himself takes interest he  publishes the documents in October 2015 they include Brennan's 47 page sf86 application a sensitive form required for obtaining top secret government security clearance the form Reveals His criminal history psychological Rec records past drug abuse and other details nobody would want about themselves online not only that from Brennan's emails Wikileaks publishes Bush era recommendations for how the presidency should operate in the Middle East there's also an internal Congressional correspondence from the  Senate select committee on intelligence that offered suggestions on how to make future interrogation methods also known as torture compliant and legal the breach cost the agency $1.5 million in Damages and relocation costs as several operatives went into hiding but before they knew that there was basically no Threat Level above all it was widely embarrassing hacking into Brennan's email was laughably easy this is true and it's true that you guys have actually broken into his private email account how difficult would you say it  is uh you mean out of 10 sure out of 10 one one it's a lot of I guess private information really pretty stupid really he's he's supposed to be so high in the government like head of CIA he should be more clever can you give us any indication of your background I mean how old you are you in theed United States I mean anything you can tell me about yourself yeah um I'm Bel the age of 20 years old um I smoke pop and I live in America and and you smoke pot every day we wonder what John Brennan must have thought while  undoubtedly watching this in his relocation house what Fury must have built up inside him the CWA aren't done they they release more and more information with control over clappers and other operatives accounts it's even easier to get people to give up information to inter access further accounts and databases they gain access to FBI's deputy director Mark Giuliano's account there they discover a database with personal information of 9,000 Department of Justice officials and 20,000 FBI agents they post it they then get access  to the Justice Department's joint automated booking system which has records on all us prisoners they check out the records of fellow hackers like Jeremy Hammond and post those online as well they wreck havoc and embarrass one institution after another did these kids really think that they were going to get away with it at the time I really didn't care I just like that was towards the end of the run and was just like all bets are off you know had gone all the way down the rabbit hole I just become  very disillusioned with people's complacency and their lack of care for what was going on so it's like we're going to bring attention to this with like chaos in [Music] Mayhem kraka knows his actions have poked a very big bear he knows there will be consequences he just doesn't know what they'll exactly be I'm going to go to Russia and with Snowden cuz I know that the government are pretty mad about this I'm probably going to get tortur I'm actually a pretty fast runner default is paranoid the whole time  constantly worried about his obsc but he let his guard down default became involved with an ex-girlfriend of one of his friends according to him he asked his friend in advance if it's okay with him the friend says sure go for it he's way over it but he isn't default and his friend are hanging out one night drinking and chatting over Xbox Live I slip up for the first time ever being arrogant and cocky it comes on the news CI director hack blah blah blah all this stuff and I'm like yeah that was us blah  blah I was like drunk talking and just totally like gave myself away he never thought his friend would do anything with that information hell he didn't even think his friend would necessarily believe him but today default is pretty sure this friend turned him in when the FBI raids you they don't knock politely FBI agents entered a false room just just as his computer finishes decrypting they're pointing assault rifles in his face they drag him out of his room flash copy his hard drive before it re-encrypts and sees all of  his equipment default knows he's finished but the worst part watching the agents carry off his hard drive the hard drive with nearly 1,000 Bitcoin he blacks out kraka too gets raided by the British police forces and his computers are confiscated this team clear that go one other CWA member gets arrested in the US and three more in the UK since krco was underage and in the United Kingdom he got a lenient sentence he spent two years in a juvenile detention center he was the first minor in the UK to be imprisoned for hacking  today he's keeping his head down and is done with crime he just wants to make a career in cyber security and move on with his life he did not want to give us an interview default even though he was less involved paid a much higher price he went straight to federal prison with a 5-year sentence he had to pay $145,000 and restitution and due to co regulations spent a significant amount of that time in solitary confinement while pleading in court he said I thought what I was doing was right in terms of political justice but 2 years  later I realized I was completely wrong Snowden 2 didn't have a relaxed time fighting asylum in Russia shortly after his leak intelligent officials publicly fantasized about killing him whether you're principled whistleblower who truly understands the significance of what you're leaking or stone teen furious at the world's injustices messing with the US government will change the course of your life forever so make sure it's worth it in December 2023 the Biden Administration renewed a very controversial surveillance program the  ACT allows the administration to spy on anyone in the world without warrant including its own citizens it includes a a vast database of electronic communications it's supposed to be accessed only when there's a legitimate reason to believe it will assist intelligence operations but a US Court ruling in 2023 found that the FBI has already misused this database 278,000 times unlawful searches were particularly rampant between 2016 and 2020 they've snooped in the private Communications of donors to various  congressional candidates they've been watching suspected January 6 riers and they've also been surveilling black lives matter protesters maybe they're even surveilling us 	Liberal			Conservative	109
K70	https://youtu.be/rfs7vQhZRsg?si=1ZGs7SL7gg5TSA47	in the last hours the biod dad and grandparents of missing autistic boy Sebastian Rogers hold a vigil where everyone vows that Sebastian will be brought home safe and sound will he I'm Nancy Grace this is crime stories thank you for being with us here at Crim stories as we continue joining in the search for Sebastian first of all take a listen to this have the two of you taken a polygraph I have I have not would you be willing to I've offered and volunteered on many occasions to take a polygraph and I was  told directly by law enforcement because of my whereabouts I did not need one I understand Miss proudfoot did you pass your polygraph I did that's not exactly what has been stated before by Sebastian Rogers stepfather Mr proudfoot listen and Mr proudfoot you have volunteered to take a poly yes ma'am if I were to set up a poly for you would you take it name the place and time ma'am I'll be there joining me in Allstar panel to make sense of what we're hearing right now but first to Dave mat crime  online.com investigative reporter Dave Mack isn't it true that crime online.com did set up a polygraph absolutely true and what happened he uh Chris proudfoot told us that he had to he could not take it now he wanted to but he can't because the TBI told him not to it's my understanding to Cheryl McCullum joining us uh Cheryl McCullum founder director of the co case research institute forensics expert and host of Zone 7 podcast Cheryl it's my understanding that specifically Sebastian's stepfather said  he could no longer do interviews including with us because he had been instructed so by the TBI and Jackie correct me if I'm wrong that they did not want any of his interviews to interfere with the investigation and that even though he had agreed to do our polygraph he now says that the TBI is going to set up their own polygraph and he can't take our polygraph until after that and once he does that then quote we'll take it from there what do you make of it you know you and I always go back to Mark class if you want to make sure that  the law enforcement has everything they need to get rid of looking at you you can do that he can set up a private polygraph through an attorney he can take yours he can demand that TBI give him one so that they can stop focusing on him and this polygraph business and move on and find out where Sebastian is at period I mean Sher McCollum you and I can go right now and pay for a polygraph they'd be happy to take our money hey just put it on a credit card and take a polygraph TBI would be happy to accept those  results a polygraph polygraph is a polygraph and the examiner that's who you're relying on so you've got somebody that's going to be willing to testify and put their reputation on the line again he could make this happen today if he wanted to let's go straight out to Joseph Scott Morgan Professor forensics Jacksonville State University author of blood beneath my feet on Amazon and star of a hit series body bags with Joe Scott Morgan Joe Scott thank you for being with us you know what this is like static in my  ears because I know tick tock tick tock as long as we focus on The Stepfather and the mother Mr and Mrs proudfoot I'm losing time if by some stretch of the imagination Sebastian is still alive if he's alive he won't be much longer what do the stats show what what is your opinion I need it and I need it now Joe Scott yeah the the biggest thing that we're looking at is this idea of time we're talking about a young man uh that went missing back in February Nancy late February and as we move down that  timeline uh you know the odds are are stacked against him I think one of the most important pieces that's kind of arisen out of this other than all of the comments that have been made to this point relative to polygraphs and those sorts of things or those eyeglasses and I love the shot the producers put up of him standing in front of that rack of of eyeglasses because that's going to tell the tale I think if they can specifically tie those to him that's very important they can take that script off of those glasses determine if they  are his I don't think they're his glasses Joe Scott I don't think they're his glasses Es at this point in time you have to work with what you have if they're not his then that that points us down a different Road doesn't it and sometimes okay let's go with let's go with they're not his glasses and I'll tell you why I'm saying that Joe Scott I was thrilled I mean uh you know you might want to jump in on this Cheryl remember we're not having high tea at Windor Castle but it's a sad day when you're excited when you're thrilled you  think you find a missing boy Bo glasses why was I thrilled because it was a clue for a moment and then the TBI confirmed they're not his glasses so I see where you're going Joe Scott but it's a sad day when we're all thrilled to find a pair of beat up glasses on the side of the road but I was so where does that leave me Joe Scott as we're all like take a poly take a poly why won't he take a poly what really happened was he at work was he not at work while we're all nashing our teeth and switching our  Tails trying to figure out about Mr proud foot if this kid this child is out there with his autism kicking in giving him problems what's gonna happen the likely scenario Joe Scott as we're spinning our wheels on proud foot yeah if this is you know we're we're talking about Hendersonville Tennessee uh Nancy which is 10 miles outside of Nashville but you know really quickly up there that area becomes very rural and so if he is one wed off or been taken off in any number of directions his ability or survivability  is greatly diminished here and what the police are doing right now is if you think about the last known location of him that's the center of the Target and they're working from concentrically to eccentrically they're moving out in these big circles but it's such a broad densely wooded area this is a this is a Herculean task to say the least I think that some of the answers are going to rest in the idea that whoever had control over him his comings and goings we're talking about a kid that has been  diagnosed with autism whoever had control over his comings and goings their Electronics need to be tracked Nancy those ideas of where did they go at those times when he was last seen alive and that's going to be one of the threads that you're going to want to pull in this investigation you know Cheryl McCullum host of Zone 7 is a forensic expert as you know Joe Scott Morgan death investigator Cheryl you've had quite a lot to say online what about now cat got your tongue because I don't like that you're  pretty bold when nobody's questioning you but what about now I want to hear your analysis here's my problem their statements you've got inconsistencies as soon as somebody changes their story at all they should become the focus period mom has said different things now you've got a stepdad that looks like he's co-signing with everything that she says but he allegedly wasn't there so how can he agree with anything that she say you've got Mom saying she heard a thud I don't like that word that sounds like a body  hitting the floor when people use the word thud that's not sounded like he hit the wall sounded like something WR no it's never a good thing it's usually preceded by uh an ad sickening a sickening thud right and Nancy you've got other things you got Mom saying he went to the end of the driveway to put out the trash and then you've got law enforcement searching a Landfield they're searching Lakes they're searching ponds if you're watching and piding attention to law enforcement it does not seem to me that  they are looking to recover a Child Alive they are searching for remains you and I both know and Joe Scott knows when a child goes missing the first the first three hours are critical we're at six weeks six weeks this child has not been seen or heard okay hold on why are you saying Cheryl McCullum that you believe they don't expect to find Sebastian alive based on their actions I'm talking about La law enforcement there searches they're searching land Fields lakes ponds that is not indicative of somebody that is a  liive and again you've got a child that has gone six weeks without his medicine six weeks without food that we know of he didn't have a source no shoes and Mama herself says oh a flashlights missing again that's such an odd thing for her to know is missing until they show her video that looks like a flashlight and then the stat dad says well we were sure hoping it was but we're sad to report it wasn't a flashlight well if you've got two flashlights out there why are you glad that it's not that that to me would  signify that somebody was out there in the wee hours of the morning with two flashlights meaning two separate people the night your child went miss it I mean it's just odd what do you make of a threeh hour conversation held between Mrs proudfoot and Mr proudfoot the night Sebastian disappears The three-hour phone call bothers me because again that's a long time to be on the phone and you know you're hearing your son supposedly he's answering you supposedly during that time but you don't go check on him at all you know  did somebody leave their phone just on while they went and did something else I don't know but I agree with Joe Scott the electronics are going to tell the story when his mama first entertained the idea that somebody had him what did she base that on his phone's not missing he didn't take shoes didn't take clothes didn't take money nothing on his cell phone nothing on his computer says that he's been talking to anybody I mean she's entertaining something that we have no facts for well I'm concerned about  the and you're right whenever I hear inconsistent statements as I have discussed many many times in front of juries it's one thing to add or embellish your original statement because maybe you weren't asked the right questions first time around maybe you remembered something in addition triggered by questions but when you change your story that's a problem to Joe Scott Morgan joining us a professor of Jacksonville Jacksonville State University um Joe Scott let's look at where the searches are being conducted we know the law  enforcement search has been scaled back I want to hear since you are a death investigator we all three have been on many many searches for missing people and who we believe to be dead um I want to hear your analysis what can we glean from looking at what law enforcement is doing back to Cheryl's point about landfills and ponds ponds you or water bodies of water you can think that well you have people that can um just wander into these locations okay particularly somebody that might be in a compromised state like this young  man uh from a mental and a physical uh status at this point in time but when you start to talk about landfills Nancy this is a rather dark dark thing I've been to landfills multiple times conducting death investigations and those are locations where we're talking about the discarding of remains now here's another interesting point the fact that the landfill is all the way up you mean he didn't just walk into a landfill and fall over no and certainly not in Kentucky this is specifically targeted now from my  understanding is that Landfield is used to surf or serve this particular area and landfills are very complex environments they're gritted off essentially they know where they're going to do dumpings um it's not like they randomly go into these locations and just back the truck up they go to specific locations but with landfills they're highly complex they're layered and so you as you begin to stack items in there they then run over them with this heavy equipment and it makes it makes the tough the going very very  tough as a matter of fact anything that gets in there begins to degrade and decompose very quickly that's the purpose of it and so that is not a good sign Nancy and the fact that they are searching a landfill is rather ominous to me ncy I want Dave mat crime online no I was just coming to you because I wanted to talk to you Dave Mack on two issues and whatever else you want to interject please I need everybody's thoughts um one I want to get from you any previous inconsistent statements as correctly stated by Cheryl McCullum and  two allegations that Sebastian this autistic boy was molested have emerged let's start with inconsistency statements very quickly from the very beginning Nancy uh Chris proudfoot made statements in interviews online uh claiming he actually said somebody asked the question was a polygraph taken and has it been passed yes I didn't specify who or when but what I can tell you everything has been vetted completely polygraphs have come back as passed so I'm confused as in why they are all wondering if myself my wife  and the biological father took okay we know that's a lie we know that is absolutely lie because of what he told you on your show well you're saying that that's what proudfoot said that he had taken a polygraph he and his wife and had been quote vetted okay yes yes he did say that o on a on a podcast go ahead okay and then we also have the the belt you know we have hitting hitting Sebastian with the belt I don't know if you caught this but you know when Seth Rogers was on your show last week when  we were talking about the the belt he started um I saw later Seth referred to it he was aware of the corporal punishment that Chris proudfoot was handing out to his son to Seth Rogers autistic son and you know we pointed out that he uh proudfoot claimed it was years ago and it was one spank with the belt on his butt but through clothing which makes no sense to any parent in the history of mankind or any teacher at school that they would actually look into something through clothing like that but they couldn't remember when how  long ago it was and another interview he said 15 which means it had to have been in the last several months so we've got a number of Sebastian turn 15 in December correct and it went missing February 26th so if he was 15 when he got um a whack with a belt that would have been in the last few months just before he disappears so which one is true was it three years ago or was it when he was 15 years old um another question allegations that Sebastian was molested have now emerged what can you tell us  from Seth Rogers uh Sebastian's biological father Seth Rogers said that when the Prouds when Katie and Chris proudfoot and Sebastian were living in an apartment in California a couple of year several years ago that Katie proudfoot allowed a boy that was five years older than Sebastian to play with Sebastian and the boy was 13 Sebastian was eight this time she allowed Seth Rogers said that Chris Katie prfo allowed a 13-year-old boy to play with Sebastian who is eight un without any kind of involvement from  Katie proudfoot and that during the time this 13-year-old molested and raped Sebastian Rogers it seems the more we investigate um the Mercure the facts become this is what I know every day literally every hour that Sebastian Rogers is missing is one hour closer to him being dead can we tune out all the static and the noise and try to focus on finding this autistic boy and to you Mr proud foot our offer is still on the table for a polygraph free of charge to you I'll pay for it out of my pocket we wait as the search goes on  goodbye friend guys thank you for watching crime online

K74	https://youtu.be/zz86OqALsH4?si=bUys_MLZ93nNH30e	[Music] rivalries yes i've always had rivalries in my studio yes i always pick kids against each other it's just what i do it and she was late and got on time and didn't have music and probably know what she was doing beautiful girl beautiful dancer professional dancer worked for many many many years at tokyo disney and blah blah blah but you have to have somebody at the ballet bar that is standing next to you somebody whose leg is maybe a little bit higher one day and the next day yours is higher so  everybody has their rival their competitor someone that you stand next to the ballet bar or across the ballet bar and you just keep that eye in the mirror at your leg then also you're looking at their leg back and forth and back and forth and that's what makes you a better answer so you kids with these private lessons i get it for choreography it's great maybe if you're having children with a certain trick or you were sick and you were out that's fine but you need to be in class even if it's a virtual class with us on  some days you need to be in class because we are going to pick you against somebody and you are going to work that much harder so back to the competition i was so sick and tired of hearing it let's have both kids do the same dance we'll teach them the same routine and uh may the best man or a little girl win well did this backfire on me we sat in the audience we watched the routines the scores come you know thing at the end of the competition where they're either in trouble if they lose or after they win  and this and that so the competition will hand me the music the score sheets uh any of the extra ribbons or trophies that they left behind her she's talking to everybody and she's using and booking herself other jobs i'm not sequestered with the psychos and so i got the paperwork and i never look at it i never really look at it i just hand it to you to the producers or and it's out of your settings and i opened it up just because like i guess they've been taking a long time during fall or something i opened it up  and i looked at the scores and i i came over exactly but so it was like i don't know 15 for choreography so 47 out of 50 47.5 out of 50. 25 well one of them said 30 out of 25 so how can a kid get 30 points for appearance when it's only worth 25 so that's where the higher score came in and i said wait a minute this is wrong did they mean to write 20 or how how can you get a 30 in school on a math test how do you get a 30 out of 25 impossible so i took it back and i said i don't know what this is but the score  is wrong this this is wrong or somebody wanted it to be the math is wrong or the judge just thought i'm going to throw this down and see if it goes through or it was a simple clerical error right they thought it was 30 30. instead of 30 out of 25 right so 25 out of 25. so then you come to me and then it was an uproar but i'm like we didn't do it an uproar an uproar i felt like i was like crucified like it was insane it wasn't us it was that we couldn't take it that this other kid beat this kid and oh the favorite  didn't win and look at it no if the competition made an error competition needs to fix the other just like for miss america you announced the wrong girl you better fix it right then and there and they get it fester and they did and they came back in and they said the right thing and it was the other one that won and but that was our fault yeah what is their fault i just can't believe i found it and i was so angry that somebody else could win because we were so mean and we were so nasty and we hated that little  girl that's all bs that that is ridiculous yes you know you every kid comes in the studio and you love somebody so that's what really happened right so that's that so are the competitions fixed no and that's a huge issue with doing a television show that revolves around competitions first of all these competitions would lose their shirts if everybody thought they were fixed uh that could never happen and the integrity of the show the integrity of the world of competition of going to these competitions every single weekend  if they were all fixed i mean ds moms was so so so influential in the competition world that i think if anything would have went haywire or you know been negative towards the competition they literally would have went out of business right and we wouldn't have had any competition to go to now there's another competition there's always exceptions to the rules or to the norm and there was an exception and i boycotted if you will a competition and the woman who owned it who was lovely to us and nice to us in  the beginning everything was great she came into our dressing room accused one of the girls at home's knee of being and i was appalled and from that moment and what was going on backstage and it was like they pretended they had listening devices backstage they could overhear us which they just were making stuff up it was out of control i've never been involved in anything like that i've never you know had a competition director come into a dressing room and talk to a child like that it was i could talk to the kid  that way they're my students but somebody else that we're paying to attend their competition no way so when it came i have told the network i told the production company we're never going to that again we're not going we're not going we're not going in that competition sure enough they have us going to the competition i said i'm not going i told this one you're not going i told the mothers we're not going if we band together and we don't go they don't have a tv show to shoot if you guys break in your little weasels and you go  without me then they have a show to shoot and it's all about how he didn't show up that is not abby this no so we won the kids choice awards we went and we won a kids choice award and it was facts and it was the first kids choice award that that network ever won i mean come on they're not a kid's network they're not a children's show we heard that every other day right the next day i was not going i had a really rough night i was really sick and all this like cramping my bags and the paramedics  haven't come to my hotel room it was awful so i did that was an excuse but i knew i wasn't going and i was fined 80 000 80 000 that's my mom and dad's life savings that they gave me to buy the land to build my building in pittsburgh pennsylvania that was my dad worked for 43 years for the railroad and that was his life savings and they fined me that for not going to a competition that i thought was sticks and i still believe it was i mean it was ridiculous not so much fix like cheating and scoring and this and that but you know  when you hire the judges for the competition if you hire three top judges that don't like acrobatics don't like contemporary or this or that or if you hire three ballet judges freeman ballerinas who are retired who don't like acrobatics or this or that you know as a competition director if you're judges like this or like that you know what they eat at lunch you know what they order you know if they want to go out to dinner at the end of the competition or if they don't you know all this because you've hired them over  and over again so i think in that sense kind of know what they're going to like it but they're not going to like and um i did not trust this woman as far as i can see her and the mothers were so afraid they were going to not get their bonus their mothers their mothers their mothers i thought they were all independently wealthy and without a tv show they would all be living in manchester are the children i didn't think the tv show had anything to do with that so i don't know why you're worried about a bonus  there was one other competition i knew it was going to be a show i already know the one you're thinking i know i mean i i learned though you know i got my big fine and this was also the nationals this was the finale of the season so i you know had to go my attorney would go driving me himself do you guys remember the nationals with the dance the waiting room an amazing routine and one outfit oh my goodness oh my goodness but wait wait the costumes the costumes i was out till probably four in the morning i was just  hoping kalani wasn't gonna fall off the steps yeah yeah you always wondered if she was like on it and in it or if she was like but uh the kids did an amazing job it was an amazing number it was all about being in the waiting room and some of the people had been in an accident you can tell that they're bandaged or they're bleeding or this or that you know when you go to the hospital waiting room just like i was recently in another emergency room waiting room waiting to be seen and it was incredible  and we always have to pull the stop sign we need to find something that we haven't done before something that we maybe did years ago before television and it comes back to us like oh let's do this again uh and to find something new it's never been done so this competition was bizarre to begin with i remember this guy and they were owners and the girl was like a former cruise ship dancer kid judging or was that not that one yeah and they were falling out two afternoons so anyway we all got up and walked out  when they announced the winners when they announced the waiting room was second that's where we left we did but then but then the guy came trying to come apart a lot and like tell us that it was wrong or tell us that well you won this and here's this paper and he's like throwing papers at us with all these different scores on it yeah we won the talent everybody didn't win this and you get with the costume you wonder well mckenzie won the title but we didn't announce it we forgot to announce the  title they didn't want us to the tv show they want us to announce that she won the title with that right there i was in the parking lot like i was gone i was getting in my car and they were literally the guys like the camera crew and the sound guys were trying to stop our cars from pulling out but the mothers finally agreed finally listened and walked with me and we all went we looked really bad it looked bad we looked like we were pouty little we were spoiled rotten brats and we were we were we were  because we had worked hard we knew what we were doing we knew the number was going to when you know when you're sitting there when you're beat or not lost a lot of times like we've seen numbers that i'm like oh but how yes when you were a kid and we were at the competition we knew when we got there we knew looking in the program i used to have i love this i used to have dance teachers and parents and other people when they got to a competition and they saw mark meyer's name in the program that he was against them  they pulled up they just scratched their solos because they just didn't want to lose to him i gave and again and again that makes you feel amazing right and they're coming and telling you that so that's great but i think you paid you should get out there do the dance so anyway we never pulled numbers we don't scratch things well i probably did here and there to to punish the child or the parent say you know what keep complaining about the routine go ahead because nobody cares she's not doing it too bad  uh because you just could stick your hair in your mouth but that competition yeah something that she was going on and i know it was a producer there was one producer well many producers that we had over the years that didn't know squat about dance actually the guy gets credited with creating the entire show i've never been to a dance competition before shooting dance moms that's a little crazy isn't it and all of the people behind the scenes uh picking the music or picking the themes or picking you  know who should dance what they should dance to what the routine should be about have never danced never dance never went to dancing school never competed never won a competition never even got a participation trophy nothing i remember going they're telling us what this child is going to do and this is the music she's going to use it's ridiculous that's why i should have done executive producers i remember uh for season eight i had i was uh helpful in the casting of the season or just kind of saying you  know once they had their moms and their kids who could actually dance and this and that and i remember one day i was in the office and i and we were sitting at a table and jokingly i was like who's danced before has anyone in here ever danced you weren't joking you were trying to have them raise your hands no one raised them yeah not one person and i thought they were joking i thought they were kidding and i was like not even when you were little like not even like when you were four or five didn't tap and do ballet  nobody no knowing how do you work on a television series as a producer producing dance routines dance numbers dance choreography on a stage and you never took a dance lesson in your life to all the producers from dance moves you're not that good trust me you're not that good so there you have it the competitions as far as we're concerned not fixed no not at all no what the judges are doing the competition directors are doing and are they listening to the producers are the producers in their ear telling them this  is who we want to win this week this is who we don't want to win we don't have no idea we have no idea did they try or bet they tried i'm sure they tried yes so there you have it i remember i remember one of the producers telling me one time uh the season that we had a winning streak it was like 13 or 14 wins in a row of group dances i remember one season four okay i remember uh one of the producers came up to me and said it's getting boring that you're winning every week i said well not for a dance teacher it's  not but okay not for parents that are payout not for other customers we went out and i've never heard that like i was so i was so shocked it threw me so so off to hear that that the show was getting boring because we were winning all the time oh the show so i'm sure that they tried to have their say in who they wanted to win to to push the story along right and then there was always i had to watch because we were mics constantly i would have a microphone on i would fall asleep in the microphone  and still be on and if i knew that a studio was attending a competition and they had a really good kid or they were just a really good studio and they were friends of mine you know friends for years oh we're going to see so and so this weekend yes whatever and they're going to be in virginia and we love them and they're so good they would pick up on it they would hear it call them and get their best kid the age of whoever we had competing to go against us then when we came in and we sat in the theater they would be  behind us they'd be behind us but then the kid that we were talking about amongst ourselves would be on the stage right before our kids would throw our kids off i mean we could have been talking like in the parking lot or talking at lunch and they still hear us so that's how a lot of that stuff happens also yes they just overhear you and they run with it and go with it because guess what they can't really produce anything themselves they just take it from us and manipulate it and rework it and that's  it so if you always wanted to know if the competitions are fixed or not yeah i know yeah yeah if you have any more questions about competition tips and tricks then uh ask us we're there every sunday on zoom we teach every sunday yes and uh i'd be happy to take your questions and give you the answers yeah see you there [Applause] so you 	Center			Center	111

pounce on him at this point or approach him try to hit him when he's down in the water you see him try to grab at Tony that's T you'll hear that's Tony and the jean shorts Tony walks by him Tony has his back to Nikolai and you'll hear Tony yelling in the video get back get back to hear testimony from Tony that he thought he was breaking up a fist fite so he's yelling at somebody off  screen to get back he has his back to Nikolai Nikolai gets up still with the knife in his hand that person in the top left of the left photo is Riley so after Tony you hear him yelling directing somebody off screen to get back he turns over turns to Nikolai and he's yelling get back get back and you see and pointing in the video and yelling and you see nikolai's hand going back with the knife in it he makes a stabby motion off screen Tony's yelling at him get back and then you see Riley's just been  stabbed that group in the background there that Nikolai is facing with nobody between him and that group is his group that's his group of tubers Tony you'll see and you hear from him when he testifies that he's just yelling at Nikolai to go Nikolai doesn't again that's his group in the right photo the guy with the aviators that's his friend Ariel almost up to Nikolai Nikolai doesn't walk back to his group instead he turns to Tony with the knife in his right hand he stabs at him twice you can see Riley bleeding in the  background Ariel nikolai's friend is there as he's lunging the knife at Tony that hand there on the bottom right hand corner you'll see more clearly in the next still shots Isaac goes to shove Nikolai see the gold bracelet as he's shoving Nikolai Nikolai launes out with the knife Nikolai kind of stumbles back from the push comes back with his knife covered in blood and dripping blood he can see the women recoiling from him Nikolai ends up by his friend Ariel as he's stumbling from the you don't see Dante get stabbed in the  video but I expect you'll see evidence and testimony that it was after this it's not until this point in the video after he stabbed AJ Riley Tony and Isaac that you hear people will start react and realize what's going on with the video you hear that they all suddenly saw AJ and you'll see in a second what they saw up until that point people didn't realize that Nikolai was stabbing people you'll hear in the video the shock and disbelief that's what just happened camera pans around you see Nikolai looking in the direction to  where AJ and Isaac are AJ is in the water holding in his guts Isaac's friend scatter and run Joan who's filming runs back Nikolai walks away you can see at this point if you recall the photo of Dante he's got dark chunks on the bottom light on top he's got his hands on his torso and he's looking down Nikolai continues to walk away he walks by his friend Ariel on that right photo he's standing in front of Ernesto he walks by Ernesto on the right there that's Alex Bing running to Isaac who is collapsed  in the water you see AJ struggling that's Nikolai by Ernesto Nikolai continues walking the camera pans away when it pans back Nick's off in the distance pans down a little bit and that's what the middle photo is showing and then you see in the right sorry in the left photo you see he approaching the right Shore camera pan hands down pans back up he's walking away from the right Shore Isaac's group and the Carlson's group start helping each other try to get to shore get the victims to shore Isaac and AJ who are  collapsed Nikolai starts walking back from the right over across to where his group is at The Sandbar camera pans around the water it's water's running red it's Isaac's hat floating by almost back to his group and see people trying to help Adrian and Isaac you see couple people from the Carlson's group Who start to call 911 we hear from four people that were stabbed and none of them saw Nikolai with a knife they didn't notice he had a knife they didn't know they thought they were punched until they looked down and  see all the blood there's not going to be any testimony on what Isaac saw if he saw Tony get stabbed right in front of him when he went to shove Nicolai CU Isaac's not going to be here to tell what he saw we hear that some Good Samaritans who are also tubing some nurses tended to AJ and Isaac until law enforcement ofair of Medics arrived AJ as a result was disemboweled he had to have emergency surgery he was in the hospital for nearly a month and had to have numerous follow-up surgeries Riley who was in the bini in the middle  photo was stabbed in the side had sliced her diaphragm now she had to have emergency surgery Tony was stabbed twice one I'll describe how he kind of blocked it he thought it was a Punch coming in so it just kind of scratched him but the other one went into his torso Isaac was stabbed in the chest and the Torso cut clean through two ribs sliced his heart died almost immediately he was 17 years old

K102	https://youtu.be/bzZnqXvRSLE?feature=shared	this is what Thomas Jefferson saw from Monticello the view as perfect as his high ideals well I'd like to welcome you to our slavery at Monticello tour but at Monticello today it is the imperfect Jefferson we see Monticello was a plantation and must judge for ourselves Jefferson professed a hate slavery called an abominable crime but he held on to his slaves he freed only seven the author of the Declaration of Independence who wrote that all men are created equal owned six hundred slaves over his  lifetime and in addition to his legitimate children almost certainly fathered at least six other children with his slave Sally Hemings for generations descendants of Sally Hemings have been telling stories implicating Jefferson his father of her children DNA proof of a connection came in 1998 is Thomas Jefferson any less great because the understanding we have of him now is three-dimensional most human beings I know are quite capable of denial and hypocrisy and I think that Jefferson's virtues were enormous and his vices were  equally enormous Pulitzer prize-winning author Jon Meacham has just published a best-selling new biography of our third president look dad in full you find a man whose life was made possible by slavery who had misgivings who as a young man attempted however feebly to reform the institution but in the end he was ultimately someone who was trapped by allowed himself to be trapped by the economic political and cultural circumstances into which he was born Jefferson said that his earliest memory was of being handed up on a pillow as a  toddler to a slave on a horse and we know that his last words were asking burl Cobert to adjust his pillow here in this room Jefferson's but Burrell Tolbert was also a slave there would have been an intimate relationship really from from birth to death Elizabeth Chu is curator at Monticello now are there pieces of furniture in this room that were made by slaves yes in the the joinery or the furniture making woodshop in Jefferson's later years was run by a slave named John Hemings and Hemings ran the joinery and  made many pieces of furniture that are in Monticello today this is an example he was very highly skilled and he was freed by Jefferson in his will and given the tools of his trade John Hemings is remembered because of his craftsmanship unlike so many other Jefferson's slaves to be able to sort of have an image of Jefferson that we all know and behind him the names of the 600 people that he owned in his lifetime really means that we have to understand slavery in order to understand Jefferson Lonnie bunch  heads the Smithsonian's National Museum of african-american history and culture sponsor of a traveling exhibition about slavery at Monticello and what's powerful is quite candidly we only know the first things and there are some that we just have is unknown Lucy Lucy it's almost any old name that's exactly right this is Thomas Jefferson's laptop desk this is the desk upon which he wrote early drafts of the declaration independence the first of those drafts attacked Britain slave trade Jefferson  writing that King George the third has waged cruel war against human nature itself the Continental Congress took the phrase out alongside the rejected passage the financial reality next to it is his farm book and here is where he would list the births and deaths of the slaves he would list the work that they did so in some ways it really gives us a full picture of the totality of Jefferson which at times contradicts the popular image of Jefferson as a benevolent slave holder the male reoccupied one  half of this site inside there were four forges one example what went on at Jefferson's extremely profitable nail making workshop at Monticello as the young child your job was to move the nails around but by the time of year 12 13 14 your job is to make these nails the boys were routinely whipped to force them to be more productive that happened while Jefferson was on Monticello it happened when he was gone because in the 18th century you couldn't run a plantation without using violence a man of his time Jefferson thought he was  benevolent but even his plan for ending slavery would be considered racist today his view was that at best there could be an emancipation but then there would be repatriation there would be colonization African American slaves would leave the United States he did not foresee a biracial integrated Society one of the many ironies of his life because he created a biracial Society at Monticello this is an artist's imagined portrait of Sally Hemings sister of John Hemings the furniture maker she was also believed to be Thomas  Jefferson's wife Martha's half-sister the entire Hemings family ended up at Monticello but it was in Paris in the 1780s while Jefferson by then a widower was u.s. minister to France but he supposedly began a nearly 40-year sexual liaison with Sally who was there with him by law she was free in France before agreeing to return to Virginia to slavery she set conditions according to her descendants she said I will go back with you if any children we have are allowed to be free to 21 Jefferson must have been totally  flummoxed by this strong-willed I think quite courageous woman in September 1802 a Richmond Virginia newspaper outed Jefferson say by this wench Sally our president has had several children after that the Jefferson Hemings story was whispered from one generation to the next for nearly 200 years by descendants of Sally Hemings many of whom passed for white it's been an interesting journey for me because it started out when I was a kid me standing up in class and saying Thomas Jefferson is my great-great-great  great-great-great grandfather and being so happy and proud to brag about it you know when we're studying the presidents but then when the teacher says sit down and stop telling lies and all the kids laugh at you by the mid-1990s the laughing had stopped historians even at Monticello were becoming believers television reporter Shannon Lanier is a direct descendant of Sally Hemings through her son Madison Hemings before that reunion I had only known the Hemings descendants from Madison line of the family I didn't even know the  Jefferson line Shannon Lanier right in front there was 19 when he attended the controversial first ever combined Hemings Jefferson family reunion at Monticello in 1999 afterward he and Jane Feldman the photographer who took this picture traveled the country interviewing four generations of Hemings and Jefferson's for a book Jefferson's children our journey in the Jefferson's story kind of acts as a catalyst for people to be able to discuss the topic of slavery we had a family Bible a great big thick number and my mother inherited  it from an uncle and in there was an entry among others Brown Colvard in 2006 Bill Webb's wife doing some research found Brown Kolbert listed as a Monticello slave it turns out he was the brother of Jefferson's Butler Burrell Kolbert and as a boy worked at the nail making workshop which Webb decided he had to see Here I am standing on the very same land where my ancestor had worked as a young preteen and now that's heavy it was something that brought tears to my eyes to say my god my god Thomas  Jefferson is buried at Monticello inscribed on his monument the achievements he wanted to be remembered for including the Declaration of Independence but he will be remembered as well for the legacy that is not written

K130	https://youtu.be/1qUS5gdGUtE?si=JNUOznUQDR5CHzVK	Christian nationalism what does that mean to you and do you think that we should be a Christian nationalist country uh I believe that we should be protecting our freedom of religion and it seems that Christianity is under attack in this country um it's pretty evident when college campuses allow things um to be talked about everything under the Sun but when anyone tries to speak about Christianity they're pretty much shut down um you see it in protests around the country people are shut down and it's really unfortunate so it is  important to me that that's protected and do you think the Bible should be taught in public schools yeah I I mean why not we have a separation of church and state you know it might be to some people but not to me I just know that God is in charge and whatever he does is it's the only thing to be doing or that can be done so he's going to take a lot he's going to go a long ways before he destroys the evil and what's the evil as you define it now you well you know I I I can't go that far I know the evil and you know the  evil but we don't speak it that way Christians don't anyway I don't no I I I mean when you when you refer to evil cuz I don't know what you know evil to me is people who kill people well Biden's evil and that's about all I can say to that in what in what ways is he evil you know yeah I I got it all out thank you for it so the Constitution was not written for uh immoral unjust people the Constitution was written for moral spiritual people who could discern the times and the seasons through the word  of God we have um you know God God is trying to help America and the man for the mission is Trump so we need to follow Trump uh but what if Trump were to lose what would that mean that that that that didn't work out or what would it mean for the country well God has his plan and God knows everything if if that happens um it means suffering for the people and I don't think uh God wants that at this point in time I think that uh most of America is a faithful uh people America is actually following Christ more than  we think whatever and I think that God knows this do you think America should be an exclusively Christian country uh yes I think that it should be a Christian country and let's say we became a Christian country what would you say to your Jewish friends and neighbors well I think that um the base of this nation was Christianity and they know that you know just like Israel was uh the Jewish religion and we know that and we love them you know and we respect them for how their nation is and they respect us for how our nation is run and  I think that uh you know both nations are very very close Commandments wise and everything I think that uh the right path is to keep America uh a Christlike America but we have a separation of church and state in this country uh there is uh separation but not in the Constitution the Constitution uh was uh based uh on the our heavenly father I don't think they use those words though right um not those words but the men that did the job of writing the Constitution they were very faithful men and we're standing in Virginia Thomas  Jefferson wrote the articles of religious freedom that everybody here is free to worship whomever they please do you think we should teach the Bible in public school uh yes I do I do believe that um I I believe that it does brings the Spirit uh of uh of um America and that he helps the children you know Michael Flynn he said that if the country is one nation under God it should be one nation under one God do you agree with that yes I do yes so what would that do for Donald Trump's Jewish children who don't worship the same  God but don't they still I mean it's still the same God they just don't worship Christianity they don't worship Jesus right right isn't Jesus the god of Christianity he he is there three in one um so um and what about your our you know Muslim people in the country should they be made to worship Jesus as well I don't no I I guess I guess everybody we should have our how about we keep religion out of it Michael Flynn the other day said that the country is one nation under God do you believe with that I do he's saying because we're one  nation under God we should be one nation under one God do you agree with that absolutely so what what then you know like Donald Trump has children and grandchildren who are being uh raised Jewish what would happen in that case to to people like that um well the Jewish religion that they have the right to believe in in their person which is God the Jew the Jewish religion believes in God I personally am Roman Catholic I believe in God I believe in Jesus and what about a Muslim uh you know friend  or colleague uh would would they have the same protections as far as their religion goes sure so that Michael Flint in one nation under one God it's not he's saying that there's one Christian God is the way I hear it but you're saying that that shouldn't be well in in my eyes it is because I am a Christian right but should it be mandated to the country is what I'm saying should we be one nation under one God as the United States of America well that's that's what's printed on our money and that we should  we say In God We Trust right correct money right but but I'm I'm asking do you think we should all adopt one God the same God I think if whatever religion you're in you believe whatever High higher being is or you're an atheist well I'm I'm not not no no not you I'm not s and I don't like that you know Michael FN said that America is one nation under God and he says if America is one nation under God they should be one nation under one God do you agree with that I I'm an American you know one nation  under God that's how I feel but that's a little touchy you know a little touchy General Flynn recently said that America is should be one nation under God and one nation under one God how do you feel about that under one God I am a Christian myself and I do believe in God I think that there's a lot of unholiness that happens and there's more things I think it's just it's on a much deeper level when it comes to Big politicians we have care politicians nowadays we don't have anyone who is of the working  class any longer we have career politicians and I don't I don't believe that that's right so and then finally I want to ask um you were talking about being a Christian um Michael Flynn who you recall from the previous administrations he recently said that if Americas should be one nation under God they should also be one nation under one God um what do you think of that as a Christian I mean I'm a Catholic but overall I'm a Christian and I don't really agree with him on on that end I mean we all disagree on things President  Biden's a Catholic and he's an observant Catholic he goes to church every Sunday um how do you feel about not supporting someone or do you feel a bind to support someone who is cath I don't feel a bind to support him I don't think he should be receiving communion as a Catholic um to support abortion and the murdering of millions of innocent children I don't know how he can receive communion and say he's a Catholic I don't know how he can do that and it's as our faith that's why that's what we believe and we're a  pro-life church I mean all I go to church right down the road and every single Sunday that's the first thing they say is we are a pro-life church and for him to have the position he does and not support that it's pretty embarrassing to be honest there's a lot of talk about religion in this election and Christian nationalism what is that mean to you Christian nationalism well I'm a Christian so you know I believe in all of it and I believe Donald Trump is a Christian and you know it's a good Lord that put us here it's a good Lord  that wrote the Constitution that's what it's all about and you know so I'm I'm all about it you're crediting the Lord with the Constitution I'm sorry what was that you're crediting the Lord with the Constitution yes I am I credit him with everything Michael Flynn he recently said that we are one nation under God and he thinks we should be one nation under one God do you agree with that as well well yes and no that's that's a that's a it's fine line there I believe in Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior  Behavior if somebody else wants to believe something that's up to them don't push it on me just cuz I don't believe in it don't push your you know your religion your your you know your your sexuality that's fine if you want to be that way be that way don't push it on me General Flynn he recently said that America is one nation under God but he also went further and said America is one nation under one God should be do you think that should be the case this nation was founded on judeo Christian princip  so you know we we're a welcoming Nation it's just that we're a nation of laws and if they keep coming over illegally we're not you can't support it Michael Flynn who you probably know from you know Michael Flynn the other day said that uh if we are one nation under God then we should be one nation under one God do you think that's true I mean there is one God yes that's true it's one God but there there's so many different religions that have their own God I guess yeah that's what he meant he meant instead of having Allah you know  the Muslim God and and the Buddha God and yeah the Indians they didn't have a god they had what Spirits or something personally believing Christ is our savior and he's the son of God just don't force you 	Liberal			Center	119

uh actually we were  in a briefing in with him uh just about on Wednesday uh he brought up Iran himself he said that if there's any attack against Israel from Iran they will uh attack Iran directly uh there's been a lot of activity lately uh the head of sent centcom has visited here with iav Galant there's been a call from from Lloyd Austin the uh Secretary of Defense to yuav Galant saying that it's Ironclad the cooperation and the relationship between the United States and Israel also President Joe Biden has said the same thing that uh and he B  basically gave a warning to Iran basically what he said at the beginning of the war after October 7 and his word was don't so uh but a lot of people are anticipating the possibility of an attack here and there's speculation that maybe it could be uavs drones missiles even Cyber attack against Israel all because of what happened on April 1st with a reported uh Israel attack on the uh Iranian Consulate in uh Damascus that killed a major uh Islamic uh regime General as well as C several of his AIDS  so that's part of the scenario playing out right here Dan anecdotally was uh I have I go to a gym just around the corner here and uh one of the guys that I almost see almost every day there he's uh he's very concerned as as well our sums about this possible attack yeah and uh you know one thing I want to note here when you hear the Iran saying that well this you know or at least the reports or wherever they're getting this information from what's sourcing inside of Iran saying that this attack potentially imminent because of  this attack in earlier in April by Israel of course that neglects to mention Iran and their role in October 7th and the attack there right they did they conveniently sort of leave that part out as if Israel somehow provoked this attack on Iran it's just really remarkable to watch that spin happen and unfold and the understanding is that the general that was killed Muhammad zahad was part of planning October 7th so uh certainly they they're they they're complicit in in what was what happened on October 7th uh they fund they've  helped arm they've helped train uh Hamas terrorists and they have this whole plan uh in the Middle East right now to surround Israel with h proxies that can do what their goal is to destroy the Jewish State they have Hamas in the Gaza Strip they have Hezbollah in Lebanon on the northern border they have Iranian back militias in both Syria and Iraq uh and they also have the hooes down in Yemen and what we heard today as well is the threat to Jordan uh one nation that is right on the border there's almost uh  500 kilometers there'd be about I'm doing my quick math here maybe about 300 miles of border on uh Israel's eastern border that would be very dangerous if anything happened to the uh Kingdom of Jordan so their whole goal is eventually to have hman here in in the region and uh certainly to destroy the Jewish is one of their goals so I see in the by the way in the comments here we're monitoring everyone in the Stream we're thankful you're all here I see about I don't know 1,200 of you right now which is great and uh  we're glad you're here leave your questions in the chat I see one uh here I saw one Iran is seems like they're all bark no bite what do you make of of that do you do you think this is all more just chattering from Iran or how seriously are people taking it there and Israel well people are taking it seriously but it's a good comment because uh sometimes Iran does have a lot of bark uh but maybe not so much bite and uh there's two things I think to mention about that first of all their M Mo modus up arandi is to use proxies  uh they really don't necessarily want to get directly involved uh so they'll use Hezbollah the Hamas the houis uh the Iranian back militias in Syria and Iraq but not hit Israel directly and that's part of the chatter going on in the last few days is that Israel's been warning Israel's foreign minister uh yov cat said if you hit Israel directly from Iran we're going to hit you directly in Iran uh but the other thing is that uh and we heard this earlier today from yal Carmon he's the head of the uh Middle  East media Research Institute and they monitor uh all the Arabic uh farsy uh media what they're saying and his analysis is that uh they really don't necessarily need to respond directly to what happened on April 1 even though it was very painful uh in a direct attack against their major uh military leadership but they're looking at the long game they're playing a strategic game uh he says their main goal right now is to overthrow the kingdom of Jordan and which would hurt Israel far greater than perhaps a limited attack  back that would last a day or two so it's a good comment and you have to take uh you know sort of these things and see how things play out uh with where there be attack and then how Israel could or would respond and then what will happen uh you know if if they just play the long game yeah all right we're talking to cbn's Chris Mitchell live in Jerusalem and we thank you all for joining I see even more people are joining into the chat here which is into this live stream which is great and if you're just joining us there has been a  warning from the US they have warned that there could be an imminent attack with possibly within the next 24 to 48 hours on Israel is from Iran they're saying it's in retaliation for attack that Chris just mentioned uh on Iran in um earlier this month uh Chris and I got we got a question here from one tired mama in there says what I don't understand is this everyone knows the proxies are from Iran right Hezbollah Etc and they're supported by Iran if any of those proxies attack we all know it's Iran so why would Iran not be directly  attacked in other words I guess why are they surprised uh it's a good question and and it's part of I think sort of the military diplomatic uh dance that goes on here in the Middle East uh there's almost like Unwritten rules that uh you know if for example Israel would hit Iran directly that would change the whole dynamic there's something similar going up in the northern border right now we had a Israeli uh intelligence officer talked to us uh a few weeks ago and he said you know uh Israel will hit  certain targets Hezbollah will will hit certain targets but they they don't seem to go above this sort of Unwritten Line in the Sand uh to escalate the uh the conflict any bigger than it already is I mean there's been a low-scale war up on the northern border for since October 8 so but it really hasn't escalated into a major major conflict although many people are anticipating perhaps in May perhaps in June that there will be a major conflict up on the North uh between Hezbollah and Israel but it's a  very good question you know why don't they just hit Iran directly I'm not sure Israel necessarily right now as it's embroiled in the Gaza wants to get involved in a major war directly uh with Iran and I I'll add this stand as well you know I I know a lot of people here in Israel uh even in the government uh want Christians around the world to know uh what the situation is here in Israel uh and they want people to pray and they want people to intercede stand in the gap for uh the Jewish State and for the  threats that it's going uh through right now and also that the Jewish people around the world and and Israelis here would realize uh that they're not alone that many of their Christian friends uh around the world are standing with them in prayer and in support yeah most definitely praying for the people there and for you and your team there Chris as well of course and you know and I just remember uh listening to you talk about this and the threats from the north you know our own George Thomas just had a  report from up there as well talking about uh I think he talked to a Former Intelligence uh officer there who analyzes all these threats and they're saying that Hezbollah is more well uh funded and more precise than they ever have been before and so the the threat of an attack from up north is so much higher now because we saw what happened obviously on October 7th that they're willing to do it this isn't just a theory anymore that they that they threaten to invade threaten to wipe Israel off the map no they'll actually  do it and their capabilities are surprisingly High that's was that surprising to you to learn that well no we've been hearing that but there was a great report by George the other day and he talked to uh uh the head of Alma which is a research center right there on the northern border he was in Kash Monona and uh it's a great report so if anybody wants to see that go to CBN News there on YouTube or cbnnews.com and the point that the intelligence officer was making that the last war between Israel and uh and  Hezbollah was in 2006 we were there on that border uh covering that war and at the time it was estimated that Hezbollah had maybe 14 to 15,000 rockets and during that 34 day war they shot almost 4,000 Rockets uh about a million Israelis were either in bomb shelters or they fled the northern part of the country uh during that time and uh and right now you have a similar scenario you have uh towns like kirat Shimona a town of about 24,000 people nearly ghost towns right now all along the Israeli Lebanese border maybe about 880,000 uh  Israelis are uh no longer living in their homes they're living in hotels in fact right across the street there's a hotel we believe that people from the north are staying in but if you compare what happened in 2006 14,000 Rockets I would say a conservative estimate would be that it hasah now has maybe 150,000 Rockets I've heard over 300,000 Rockets many of those Rockets can reach almost anywhere in Israel they can they're Precision guided so they can hit uh military install they could hit power plants uh in fact  there's been talk here in the last several weeks even for the last few months that people want or maybe buying generators getting storing up with food and water for maybe three days or so and uh because the threat from Hezbollah is so much greater than Hamas and uh even though they've been fighting for several months now there's still much of their Arsenal is still intact you're just joining us now we're talking to CB bn's Chris Mitchell in Israel he's in Jerusalem and we are responding to this threat and the the  warning that has come from the United States about a potential imminent attack here by Iran on Israel could be in the next 24 to 48 hours Chris and we're glad that you all here and be kind I'm looking at the comments here we are monitoring these comments and when you get a stream this big we got 3,700 people on here almost and there's inevitably going to be trolls in there pray for the pray for the trolls in there that are doing and whatever it is that they'll do so be kind pray for them they're lost and uh lost souls so uh  they need Grace too so be praying for them but Chris I wanted to ask what what would an an attack look like most likely if this were to happen I'm praying it doesn't and it and it is all bark and no bite as we were talking about earlier but what what type of attack would we expect to see if if something did happen I think you go back to uh what might happen would be 2019 there was an attack by Iran against Saudi Arabia's largest oil refinery uh we were actually happen to be in Saudi Arabia at the time and uh  it really devastated that particular plant and put it out of action for you know several weeks or maybe a few months so that could be you know any major installation infrastructure here in Israel that could be one possible scenario uh I me mentioned Cyber attack that could be another uh possibility and uh you know and just as as we've talked about you know using their proxies and maybe Hezbollah would shoot some of their Precision guided missiles to hit some sort of an installation perhaps a military installation here in uh in  Israel so there's a variety of scenarios and uh so they may play out in the next 24 48 hours or we may see like yal kman said uh is Iran using what they call Strategic patience and waiting and not necessarily responding uh in kind in the next few hours or few days and uh and play play as we said the long game well I'll tell you what's not helping Chris is you're seeing a lot of language from the Biden Administration urging Israel to go into a ceasefire and so if other enemies of Israel are looking at this I would imagine correct  me if I'm wrong here Chris but I would imagine these enemies are looking at this saying oh so we can attack Israel take hostages do whatever we want and then they're going to all yell at Israel and tell them to stop fighting back great I mean it seems like you're just giving the green light to Iran to Hezbollah to to go ahead and launch an attack that's a great Point Dan because I think that's exactly how many Israelis feel is that uh you know the Biden ministration by restraining uh uh trying to restrain Israel from going into Rafa  the last major Hamas stronghold in the Gaza Strip emboldens the position of Hamas and their sense is that if if the us is going to restrain Israel then well what's our incentive to go ahead and release hostages or Surrender or but it it emboldens them that they can hold on maybe survive now you know in 2021 there was a war between Israel and Hamas it lasted about 11 days uh Hamas didn't win but they didn't lose and now if they didn't if they don't lose in many ways they consider that a victory so they  have four five battalions left in Rafa uh they believe that if Israel uh is restrained by the United uh States and by other countries they can hold on and so I think that's their strategy right now and they understand what's going on diplomatically and they they read what's going on uh and so I think many people here feel like the restraint by the US is undermining uh Israel's ability to destroy Hamas which they committed to after October 7th and you know the sense here Dan among most Israelis is that  they need to finish the job this is not um it for them it's existential it's a war for their survival some people have called it their second war of independence uh and so they feel they need to finish the job and the US restraining them they believe is uh not helping at all once again if you're just joining us uh Chris Mitchell here live from Jerusalem talking about this imminent threat potentially that has been Israel has been warned by the us that they have intelligence I I suppose on this attack  that could happen within the next 24 to 48 hours Chris I mean is this sort of thing unprecedented here for Iran I mean I guess knowing that we've seen an attack on Israel happen now physically Beyond just rocket a couple Rockets you know that you know were bad enough before uh with a full scale Invasion essentially so we with that context in our minds here um is this unprecedented territory for Iran to sort of not be hiding as much behind the proxies on this sort of a threat or has this happened before well I I think you go  back to uh I believe 2020 when the United States uh killed General sumani the head of the uh Islamic Republic military and uh actually in that and we were talking to yal kman earlier today about that uh there was actually an attack against the US base uh I believe in uh Kur the Kurdistan area of of Iraq uh that was actually coordinated with the uh the United States according to igal Kon in other words uh Iran said well this is what we're going to do we're going to send missiles against uh a US base but they warned them uh that  it was coming and so the commander of that uh that base was able to get some of their uh soldiers out of Harm's Way uh I believe there were some injuries related to that but nobody was killed in that so perhaps this is happened before and uh we'll see actually how this how this is going to play out with uh uh in the next 24 48 hours or even longer all right Chris again this is cbn's Chris Mitchell I just want to take a moment here and quick pause everyone in the chat almost 5,000 people in the chat and as Chuck always likes to say  during his live streams make sure you hit the like on this stream

Edwin hit that hit that like button we're all glad you're here and I'm looking for questions here the chats are going by very very quickly on my screen so you'll have to like write question and and big letters uh for for me to catch it so uh if you got question for Chris our CBN News Middle East bureau chief he is  there in Jerusalem and and uh can can answer that question for you hello from Texas we're glad you're here so uh Chris I'm interested in the the people asking for prayers so uh tell me more about that how what's going on there and I I think I just find it interesting that people that you know in these circles that that have connections to uh the politicians there and they're asking you for prayers tell me tell me about that a little bit you know uh Dan I think ever since October 7th happened I don't know  of anybody that I've told people that people are praying for Israel and praying for the leaders or offered to pray for them individually I don't know if anybody that wasn't comforted wasn't encouraged uh by the fact that uh you know many Christians uh pray and and ask God to protect them to give them wisdom to give them Comfort the scripture that comes to my mind is Isaiah 40:1 Comfort Comfort ye might people and I I think there's a real hunger uh put it that way uh in thirst for prayer and uh how  people can uh can just pray for them many many secular people I was in near o which was a kabot that was devastated on October 7th and there was a man who was a secular man giving us a tour and uh I I asked him at the very end can I pray for you and he said well I'm secular but I'll take all the help I can get and so I prayed briefly for him and uh and you could just tell the impact that it had on him the the the sense of Peace the sense of calm uh because so many Israelis have been traumatized by this  uh Dan by what happened on October 7th it's hard to know anybody that doesn't know somebody that was either kidnapped or murdered and uh you have to uh and so they're really traumatized and really grieving and mourning and uh and so some people have said you know I've heard a few things like this Israel is in h great need of a a a hot shower and a good night's sleep or you could say this is it's not say April 11th it's day it's October 187th or something like that it's really part of their psyche  right now and so prayer is a big part of comforting them and Dan I know we can do this on live because we're being just uh natural I've got 10% left I could always go in there and and uh yeah can go get plugged in Chris you go get plugged in because I have to respond I have to respond here Chris and you can listen to me I was going I'm I apologize I'm going to hop on my soap box here for a minute while you're while Chris is getting plugged in so he doesn't lose power uh on us he's he's doing that  right now I'm looking in the super I appreciate all those super chats that have come in Harper an one tired mama Del delita I think is how you pronounce that or Del appreciate those uh super chats we really do appreciate it Terry I see that coming in as well and there's a super chat in here from someone named ham who says look ham you know I appreciate the donation we're going to use this to keep um talking and praying and giving news from a Christian perspective he wrote wrote free Palestine stop defending the genocide  and I I just have to address this idea that somehow Israel is committing a genocide now the difference here between is it's just it's ridiculous enough to compare the two at all but you can see nobody's perfect but when Israel has something happen in the fog of War that's a mistake what is the difference between what Israel does and what Hamas does Hamas comes out and they lie they make up numbers they they do all kinds of things they're hiding behind people as human Shields they're in hospitals  they're in schools that is how they're behaving putting innocent people at risk and lying and not telling the truth and then you have Israel when something goes wrong and when those Aid workers were killed by an Israeli strike what happened they owned up to it and they said we made a mistake and they fired the people that were responsible for that mistake and so there's a level of accountability there and it just shows the difference between the two and so to call what is happening and what Israel  is doing a genocide is just I find it offensive personally and so I apologize for getting stirred up but when someone gets attacked like they got attacked on October 7th for for them to then be called a genocide when they respond is it's frustrating Chris and I can only imagine how you feel over there and so uh I'll get off my soap box now but ham I appreciate the donation we will take it and we will keep reporting news from a Christian perspective so Chris if you're able to if you're plugged back in  you can respond to that or you can leave it I'll leave it up to you no I'm plugged back in uh Dan I I would add that um John Spencer who is a military historian is saying that and who has studied War he studied the war in Iraq and Afghanistan uh has said that Israel has done more than any modern Army in order to live limit civilian casualties uh how do they do that they text people they call people they drop leaflets they basically Telegraph exactly where and uh they're going and what they'll be doing  to in order to save civilian lives uh so that's one thing uh the other thing is that uh what's been quoted in the um the media and by many politicians including uh President Biden is that you know 33,000 Palestinians have died in Gaza uh we know that um those numbers don't add add up statistically and and add that any death any um unnecessary death is a tragedy and yet Hamas often or does use uh its own civilians as uh propaganda so in many ways their deaths serve the Hamas strategy of making Hamas become the victim and  the Palestinians the victim which changes uh which gets reported in the Press which has an impact on public policy which is have has an impact on politicians it's part of their strategy that they use their own people as human shields uh it's been documented there have been times when Hamas is actually shooting or preventing their own people from getting out of Harm's Way and and so it's it's not genocide if they really wanted to have genocide Israel could do it but they don't and they because they  don't want to uh and they won't and so as you said that that uh that strike the other day was a tragic accident um in in the fog of War and the chief of staff the Prime Minister the defense minister all apologize profusely for the accident and the loss of innocent life so I guess that would be what I would say to add what you had already said yeah and to your point I mean I just my experience the I know you're over there all the time and I know you were there when uh former president Trump moved the US  Embassy there into Jerusalem we were there for that and remember there were big protests at the Gaza border at that time and there was a big day where a bunch of people that were obviously now we know likely Hamas terrorists trying to break through the fence with violent intentions and they got killed trying to do that warned about it still tried to break through the fence they were throwing these Molotov cocktail things on kites over there I saw those firsthand floating them over and they'd explode on the other side um but uh  Jonathan kriz showed us Chris this and you probably have seen these but maps that that Hamas had printed out online and they were little maps of the towns on the southern border that got probably the same towns that got attacked on October 7th and it was showing and saying we're going to kill Jews once we get through the fence and that's why they were taking it seriously but the media reported exactly as you were saying that look at how Israel is treating these people that were trying to go through the fence and literally  exactly what krias told me at that time happened on October 7th it it was exactly what they said they were going to do if they got through and it is what they did once they got through so uh it's it's frustrating to watch the media spin it the way they do and they just sort of take this stance where they just take the things that Hamas says and then they just run with them and it's it's it's frustrating to watch and it's why you frankly it's why you need places like CBN News and people like Chris  Mitchell who are out there to give you the truth on these sorts of issues so all right Chris I want to ask you another question from the comments here Royal Q writes do you think this will lead to World War I three now that's obviously extrapolating a lot of what's going on but I don't know if you've got a take on that some people think we're already in World War I right now yeah uh uh and and I you know the a war with radical Islam uh that just morph into different manifestations um it could lead to a  regional War it could uh if there's I would say that here there seems to be what a a progression that that many people think will happen the progression is that uh Israel will be able to defeat Hamas in its last stronghold in Rafa and that it will eventually then turn to Hezbollah up on the North and uh that there'll be a a war there much bigger uh maybe longer and maybe not depending on the scale of the war and how fast it goes or maybe how uh how much Firepower Israel can um Can exert on Hezbollah I  have been ever since 2006 uh I've heard personally from a general up on the border and what other military leaders have said that um uh they may bomb Lebanon into of the Stone Age uh they won't fight the next war with esbah the way they fought it in 2006 so definitely it could lead to a much bigger War now if then Hezbollah if if after that then uh some people may believe that would be the time to take out Iran's nuclear facilities something that really hasn't been reported a lot during these last  several months is the fact that isra Iran is really on the cusp of uh being a nuclear power or the threshold they almost have uh they have a lot of uh enriched uranium to almost military grade they do have ballistic missiles he could put the question is I think uh the missing link right now now is the fact of whether they could miniaturize a nuclear device and put it on a ballistic missile so that would be the the key element uh of of what Israel could do and as our friend joal wenberg says if they go nuclear they could do in six  minutes what took six years for Adolf Hitler to do to kill six million Jews yeah that's a frightening thought there um all right more questions Chris uh Rebecca asked she's from the Netherlands says why should Iran warn before attacking wouldn't a surprise attack be more logical from Iran's perspective so yeah that's a good question I mean it makes you think are they doing this just to put this out there and to frighten or is it just yeah I just I'll just throw the question to you I won't try to  speculate well I think what happened is when after the strike hit that they wanted to get out there at least verbally or rhetorically that they would hit back at Israel and uh that they at a time of their choosing I think the time frame may be coming more from uh us intelligence uh the Wall Street Journal is reporting that that this attack could be could be uh not necessarily will be but could be in the next 24 to 48 hours that certainly uh takes away the whole element of surprise if Iran will do what  they do um with the caveat that maybe they will as we mentioned uh use time and uh strategic patience and wait for another time I I think one of the things they did say they will they will react at a at a time and a place of their choosing so but certainly as soon as that attack took place I'm sorry I'm going to have to get my camera a little steadier here sorry will uh they they will certainly respond in some kind at some time all right if you're just joining us now and again appreciate you all being  here we got 6100 people on the chat on the stream right now appreciate that um and appreciate you all contributing with uh super chats that is very much appreciated and Johnny thank you for your Super Chat by the way Johnny B and he also asked monthly subscription plan is it coming here on YouTube uh that good question um be interested to hear from you all would you uh potentially subscribe to a monthly subscription to help support CBN News because I mean look we are largely viewer funded I we are we are donation  based we are a Ministry and so we rely heavily on your support so uh that would be that would be an interesting question Johnny to see how many people here would would hop on to a subscription on YouTube uh I mean I know that because YouTube provides the platform that uh you you have to essentially engage in some sort of Revenue split on things uh from that angle so that's not optimal but on the other hand it is great to be on a place like YouTube where there are millions and millions of people uh out  there that you can reach outside of your own walls when we have a stream like this and you guys like it and we're up to 1100 likes if you haven't liked the stream yet go ahead and do that by the way 6,000 of you on there 1100 likes keep doing that it helps it get out there more so it is a great tool for us to uh do these live streams so that you can talk and engage directly people like Chris Mitchell who are experts on things like the Middle East and what's happening there and doing it from a Christian perspective so uh it it's a  great tool and we are happy to use it and I we're up to almost a couple million subscribers now and so that's been fantastic it's been a great tool for us so far here on CBN so so to answer your question about a subscription it's something we've we've thought about but uh I mean I could take just a little straw poll here from all of you 6,000 people are in here would you would you go ahead and subscribe to it I and so I don't know maybe we can get a maybe we can get a uh gauge the temperature on that so all right Chris I  know it's late over there so are you good first of all I mean I should ask this before we keep going we didn't really discuss we we saw the news this this imminent threat here from Iran and we didn't really talk about a time and how long we're how long we would go so are you good to hang for a few more minutes I am good yes fine okay good so yeah all right so again if you're just joining us here this this threat from Iran um what what are what are some other thoughts you have on this Chris and you know as far as you're you're  there now so I mean you know what region it would be in are people sort of I mean I guess Israel is used to this sort of threat at this point it's always looming obviously a little more surreal now and real with what happened on October 7th so um what are people feeling over there and what else do you want to add to this well we we don't know where it you know a possible attack could happen there's a lot of possibilities uh as I said you know military installations of infrastructure like a power plant or  something like that certainly a Cyber attack uh which really you you know may not have any fingerprints on it uh one thing I would add it was what happened inside Iran Dan and I know you've covered this and we've talked about it before is there is a large revival going on inside Iran where many Iranians who after a generation uh of living under the uh the tyranny of the mules uh are turning away from Islam and many are and some are turning to Faith in Jesus Christ many times because of a a supernatural visitation uh they see a  man in white they they who they known to be Jesus uh so there is an underground Church in Iran right now and there's uh there's been you know in the last year or so uh a huge uh demonstrations against the uh regime uh tragically a lot of that has been um suppressed people arrested people executed um but still there's a ground swell of uh animosity against uh the repression of this regime and they need prayer too prayer that uh someday there'll be an overthrow of this regime that has brought so much uh Devastation and death  to the Iranian people and to the region and they do have a goal to they have a heimi in the region uh they want to uh have the other Sunni Nations Saudi Arabia the UAE Bahrain uh Jordan all of those Nations subject to their brand of Shiite uh Islam the number one goal they have here in the region is to destroy the Jewish State uh which is the main obstacle and drive the United States out of the uh middle least uh those two goals are pretty Paramount for the regime so to pray for the overthrow of this regime I  think is one thing people can pray about and uh and you know that would be a GameChanger of enormous proportion here in the in the region if that happens it certainly would be absolutely and uh you know Chris before we wrap here you mentioned that prayer point right there overthrow potentially of the of the regime um how about how about we how about we wrap this up here with just a little bit of prayer um are there any other prayer points you want to put in there before we go and take it before  the Lord and before we sign off here for the for the stream well pray for the Peace of Jerusalem uh pray for the wisdom for the leaders here politically and Military pray for you know a visitation in Gaza for many of these people we've heard anecdotal uh reports of some people having dreams and as well but pray that what they had lived under this uh repression uh by Hamas for 17 years um pray for protection for the Innocents there pray for the release of the hostages uh you know Dan if you were  here you can't go very far without seeing some sort of a poster uh you know at a bus stop a small poster a large poster um where you know one or more of the hostages pictures are are up there with their name and their age and um and there's saying bring them home now or let the let them go uh but that the release of the hostages and I think I would pray for the um Israeli people they they've gone through quite a trauma and obviously the people in um um Gaza have as well and I I just add one point to your friend earlier that you  talked about genocide you know the pictures come out you know quite uh Stark con yunus uh has been destroyed in many ways or parts of Gaza have been destroyed part of the reason and and I was able to go there about two months ago inside Gaza got to go into one of the territ tunnels uh you know there were about almost 500 miles of tunnels under Gaza City conun certainly in Rafa uh it was a military base a ter base that was had people living in it and almost every home uh had weapons uh whether it was a karten or a mosque or a  school even a supermarket had uh tunnels in them and weapons uh and so to go in to uh eliminate Hamas uh was the goal of the IDF to destroy this infrastructure but also try to protect the uh civilians I heard a story about two weeks ago Dan where there was a meeting and I I reached out to unra to see about them they haven't contacted me back again but the the story was this that about a week after the war about a week after October 7th the IDF met with unra and other uh Nos and asked if they could establish a  human humanitarian zone so people could go and find shelter and safety and un refused uh the this is a report I had and the report said that uh they felt like unra did it under duress because Hamas was uh calling some of the shots and we know more after the IDF went in that they found uh how complicit unra and Hamas or how uh incestuous HRA and Hamas were so uh it it the pictures look awful but um but Israel has done what it tried to do to eliminate what was an existential threat on their southern border and  while trying to protect civilian lives and yeah yeah and your report by the way when you went into those tunnels was was fantastic and eye openening really and I remember in the early days after October 7th when Israel finally went in and they were trying trying to spin again the mainstream media trying to spin that oh Israel's just putting all these things there they're setting up a staged video for you to see and you just they just keep finding more tunnels and more tunnels I mean that would be quite an  operation for them to just make all these tunnels and make it a movie set or whatever it was that they were trying to say and so those reports you don't see that anymore they kind of abandoned that after that first one because it's so obvious and plain when you see what people like yourself saw with your own eyes going down there and seeing this stuff it's it's absolutely crazy and horrific um but I appreciate you for going in there and doing that it was really compelling uh stuff to watch and and um and sad at the same time to see  how Hamas is uh using its citizens as human Shields we've long suspected that and known that and then to actually see it the proof of it is is a whole another thing so all right let's pray here Chris to close it up I know it's late over there and I've appreciated all the time that you've spent with us here and and sharing your knowledge on what's going on there and uh I'll kick it off and then if you want to close it up that'd be great all right and you all pray along with us there at home on the  stream so all right heavenly father thank you so much for this day for the air in our lungs for the life that you give us uh I'm thankful for Chris and his team in Israel reporting and bringing the news that they are bringing to us and we do lift up these prayer requests that Chris mentioned the uh the safety of the Israeli people we pray for the people caught in the middle of all this in Gaza as well and um and for the loss of life that has happened and what happens in war war is horrible nobody  wants war and so uh we lift up all of uh the the lives that are caught in the middle of this and we just pray that your loving hands are are in this situation that that people's eyes are open to you Lord ultimately that's what we want to see is your name glorified uh in the midst of all this so um that's my prayer for the people there for Chris and his team for the reporting that we do that it would be an honor and a glory to you ultimately uh and lift up your name amen father we pray right now for  the hostages that are in uh maybe a tunnel maybe a uh a home but but deprived of food and water many times uh we pray for the female hostages the women who may have been raped or sexually abused Lord we pray that you would comfort them in the midst of their this horrible uh six months and more that they've gone through we pray for the families uh of these hostages that are in anguish uh because their loved ones aren't with them and they don't know exactly what kind of condition they're in some of them they found out that they  they're um they have died or been killed or been executed um so we pray that you'd comfort them as well we pray father for wisdom for the Israeli political leadership for the military leadership that they would know what to do and that they would um have your wisdom from above both to protect lives and to eliminate what is a direct threat to uh to the state of Israel and the Jewish people we pray for comfort for the Jewish people who are experiencing a ground swell an unprecedented ground swell or perhaps perhaps since the  Holocaust of anti-Semitism and hatred of Jews and we pray that Lord that you would protect them and watch over them and keep them safe and father we pray for the Peace of Jerusalem we pray that you would watch over this city in this region father we pray that you would thwart the plans of the enemy the plans of Iran uh from trying to hit or harm and uh and Lord we pray in the midst of all this that they would be Revival whether it's in inside Iran or inside Gaza or Lebanon Lord that your name as Dan prayed would be  glorified that you would be exalted and that people could come and find true peace with the prince of peace and with you Jesus and we ask that in your name amen amen all right Chris thanks so much for

K202	https://youtu.be/8X6p81siw64?si=df6I7BHMbtsmAsxE	some major breaking news here that will have massive implications on the 2024 election the Nevada Supreme Court has just ruled that an abortion measure is allowed to appear on the ballot this November which if passed would enshrine the right to abortion in the state constitution the implications of such a decision are massive considering Nevada is one of the closest swing states in the 2024 election cycle and also a state where Democrats are defending a must-win US senate seat all of which is to say  all our eyes are on Nevada as we head toward November and abortion being on the the ballot instantly becomes the number one issue for nevadans casting their ballots the development puts particular focus on the US Senate race where Democratic senator Jackie Rosen is a champion for Reproductive Rights a valuable position in a state where a staggering 69% of people support abortion rights contrast that with her opponent Republican Sam Brown who called the issue of entrenching existing abortion banss quote non-negotiable  which you can see in this ad um and and so I would just say that on issues of life that is a non-negotiable for me we've got to do everything we can to empower our state to make sure that it stays on the [Music] books I would have supported the legislation that passed this last special session I think that it's a shame that here in Texas which is being lotted as such a conservative state with regard to the issue of life half of Europe has stricter laws than we do here I think that we can't just let  the issue lie where at in Texas appears to be on the way to having some of the strictest abortion regulation in the country a sweeping new round of abortion restrictions are becoming law in Texas that law was designed to shut down abortion clinics across the state of Texas in a state that has already seen dozens of Women's Health Providers closed down this new law was set to close down at least a third of all the clinics in the state in one Fell Swoop when it went into effect the reality is that before the law some  women were able to obtain abortions and now many women are not and and so I would just say that on issues of life that is a non-negotiable for me [Music] yeah um not great if you're calling support for abortion bans quote non-negotiable in a state where again 69% of people support reproductive Freedom Sam Brown might have the state of Nevada confused for his church Nevada now joins a long list of other crucial swing states where abortion will appear on the ballot the Florida Supreme Court and the Arizona Supreme Court just  handed down identical rulings but only after both of those State Supreme Courts also allowed existing abortion bans to stand in Florida Ronda sanz's six-week abortion ban will take effect and in Arizona an even more Draconian total abortion ban first put in place in 1864 is in effect in fact Arizona state legislators had the opportunity to repeal the law and this is what they did [Applause] instead the applauding you see there are State Republicans celebrating the fact that they blocked any effort to repeal  the law meaning this 160 year old Ban is now officially the law of the land at least until voters have the chance to have their voices heard on the topic and to that point Republicans are already panicking and flip-flopping their positions ahead of the November elections for example Arizona's own carry Lake released to statement saying quote I oppose today's ruling and I am calling on ktie Hobbs and the state legislature to come up with an immediate Common Sense solution that arizonans can support which doesn't exactly comport  with this clip of car Lake from the 2022 gorial debate which shows her actual views on the issue of abortion Carrie we'll start with you on this one uh the new law Banning abortion well the new law Banning abortion in Arizona after 15 weeks there's that law and there's a territorial era law which bans all abortion Zippo over which law do you think should take effect my personal belief is that all life matters all life counts and all life is precious and I don't believe in abortion I think the older law is going to take take and is  going to go into effect that's what I believe will happen Okay but and but you approve of that what at conception I believe life begins at conception okay what do we do about abortion pills what do we do about I don't think abortion pills should be legal that's a very not in Arizona I believe life begins a conception in other words she agrees with the substance of this ban so either Carrie Lake's supposed deeply held principles completely flipped in the span of less than 2 years or she's seen what happens to Republicans who support  the Draconian bands and so she's just saying whatever she needs to say to get elected take all the time you need with that one and let's be clear Carri lake is only echoing what Trump is hoping to accomplish on the national stage the guy spent the last few years bragging about how it was his Supreme Court that overturned row especially since I was proudly the person responsible for the ending of something that all legal Scholars both sides wanted and in fact demanded be ended row v Wade they wanted  it ended and yet now recognizing the extent to which this is going to hurt him he's trying to claim that he's some moderating Force looking for compromise between the left and right he's not and he's trying his hardest to make sure his supporters know that he will say whatever he needs to say to get elected by winking at them with statements like this you must follow your heart of this issue but remember you must also win elections to restore our culture and in fact to save our country which is  currently and very sadly a nation in Decline our nation needs help it needs Unity it needs us all to work closely together Democrat Republican liberal conservative everyone we have to work together we have to bring our nation back from the brink and that's where it is it's at the brink and we will we will do it I promise you we will do it always go by your heart but we must win we have to win and the reason reason for his obvious Panic is this since dos was first handed down voters in Six States  California Kansas Kentucky Michigan Vermont and Ohio have been able to vote on Constitutional Amendments protecting abortion rights and every single time they won that is why Republicans are panicking because they know the Fate that awaits them so I want to be perfectly clear here if Republicans take control in 2024 at any level of government they will 100% try to pass a nationwide abortion ban and not just in red States in all states that means that people in California in New York in Vermont will all be subject to the same  Draconian ban that is what this election's about the Republicans will try to spin it they'll release slick talking points they'll change their positions they'll disavow what they said only months or a couple of years ago they'll try to make the Democrats seem like the extreme ones it is all noise the American people have made abundantly clear where they stand on this issue and it is as far away from Trump and his magga acolytes like Sam Brown and Carrie Lake and Ron understand this as possible and in the same way that we all made our  voices heard in 2022 on the back of dobs and in 2023 on the back of dobs and even earlier this year on the back of dobs we're going to do it again in November because as much as Republicans want to remake this country in the mold of their cristof fascias fever dreams the American people are awake they are paying attention and they're voting before you go I need some help please subscribe to the

K222	https://youtu.be/-kM5PVxHCEM?si=cEUA0rMoip6AVRLO	well howdy there internet people it's Bo again so today we are going to talk about the Biden Administration a new rule privacy and limitations and this is important um because I feel like I feel like the limitations of this may not be properly discussed so if you have missed the news the Biden Administration has put out a new Federal Regulation this new rule and it's through Hippa and basically what it does is it provides some Shield if somebody was to leave one state and go to another state to get  reproductive health care so if you lived in a state where something was illegal and you went to another state where it was legal it would provide sum Shield the sum is important here um the White House statement on it no one should have their medical records used against them their doctor or their loved one just because they sought or received lawful reproductive Health Care okay so as it's written as it as it exists there are limitations um like it would it appears that it would cover somebody who left a  state and went to another state to get reproductive Health Care performed it would not cover that person if say they had something mailed to them from a different state it wouldn't even apply that it also doesn't appear to be a total Shield um um it looks like it would still be accessible to anybody who was investigating they just have to go through some more steps to get there um now one of the things that is worth noting is that when this rule was proposed I want to say it was almost 20 Attorneys General from Republican states  basically urged against adopting this rule my guess is that a large number of them are going to challenge this and try to take it to court try to get it thrown out try to get it limited um the short version here is that when you see the headlines on this I would not rely on this this without talking to an attorney this does not seem as all encompassing as some of the coverage may make it out to be talk to an attorney about this um if this is something that matters to you and understand that as it is  written that may change because the Republican party for whatever reason they're still chasing the car they caught and they very well may challenge this and if they do we don't know how it would play out in court so I would just be very cautious before you go and you know stick your tongue out at the local state laws I I would I would be aware that there are limitations to this and the level of shielding might change as time goes on anyway it's just a thought y'all have a good day 	Liberal			Liberal	126
K224	https://youtu.be/Qx6BzqjTwA4?si=kUVMX0hjGwtAdMSF	[Music] hi we're the psychic twins I'm Terry and I'm Linda and we did change places so this is not Mandela Victor fine a mess with you the Illuminati is a secret organization or society that is made up of powerful elite wealthy groups that control media banking corporations politics and entertainment David Icke is a conspiracy theorist and a new-age philosopher who says the world's richest and most powerful families and bloodlines and political leaders they're really reptilian aliens he insists the  royal family is a race of extraterrestrial lizard humanoids that are ruling the earth there's like 13 bloodlines that are part of the reptilians the Illuminati an alien race supposedly according to and others an alien race called the Anunnaki or lizards lizard people have controlled humankind since ancient times but are the richest most powerful families and political leaders really reptilian aliens it it sort of gives you pause it makes you go oh maybe that's a little far-fetched it's a little crazy but they  say they include Queen Elizabeth George W Bush Henry Kissinger Bill and Hillary Clinton and the trunks and many others they can apparently yes many others and they can shape-shift to appear human I claims the lizards are behind secret societies like the Freemasons the Shriners the Illuminati for many many centuries yeah David Icke explains that this group of reptilians supposedly set up all the organized religions and monarchies school systems science and all the media to control the masses of humanity over thousands of years these  groups manipulate humanity through fear and by preying on their darkest instincts the origins of Illuminati control am a date back as far as the time of Atlantis and some had said at least as far back as the time of Christ the first group named alumini with the actual name was in Bavaria in the late 18th century it was founded by a philosopher and law professor named Adam Weiss helped and that organization called the Illuminati opposed the Roman Catholic Church's power and they wanted to free themselves from the church and  government restrictions which you can hardly blame them it really had the very first organization that was named Illuminati but it actually went back many thousands of years before that there are so many conspiracy theories flying around the internet you've probably seen lots of YouTube videos about no conspiracy theories of the Illuminati as you state all of these things but is it real does it still exist well we're just gonna give an overview but we actually feel a lot of interest according to theorists the Illuminati  have been conspiring for centuries to establish what's called a new world order that would set up a single government in power to control the planet the Illuminati supposedly has agents who control the movie industry by television music industry banking systems governments and many other powerful institutions even drug cartels and their influence will ultimately result in this totalitarian planetary one-world government one world power or even worse outcome but you kind of feel its heading in that direction right now  especially with our new administration and the threats of war and from other dictators Korea that most dictators are Illuminati I believe millions of people do believe in this and polls shows I think half of all people polled believe in the Illuminati yeah especially younger generations older generations tend to be yeah the jury's out but they're not as open and they haven't been raised with this kind of thought in the music industry legend has it that it's based on gaining power through satanic symbols lyrics  music to mind-control people and even plant subliminally plant messages and ideas into the subconscious through videos and music it is believed that some entertainers are to sell their soul for power fame and fortune and to become you know really really rich but they've become puppets in so doing they become puppets of the Illuminati and they pay a heavy price in in many different ways sometimes that price is death so this year as you know we've seen dozens of celebrities and politicians exposed for  sexual abuse harassment and even trade just today Matt Lauer the biggest guy and TV news was fired from NBC The Today Show fired him because of sexual misconduct and so that's a shocker although we did predict the huge Hollywood scandals that would break this year this is probably the biggest year for Hollywood scandals ever you know we did see it coming now in producer Harvey Weinstein he has 86 women she's now coming out against him and accusing him of assault and actor Kevin Spacey now he's abused  young men for many many years and he got away with it CBS host and legendary journalist Charlie Rose has been fired by CBS NPVs so this goes on a dr. Luke just to name a few we actually see a lot more people being exposed as women come forward and step into their power and really speak truth to power I really think that if it's happened to you come forward tell your story the time has never been better to be honest about this because we have to change the abuse of women and it's a long long history that dates back you  know we have to end it absolutely in fact I just heard there were like 16,000 women in the military that filed sexual assault claims in 2016 alone yeah and it was covered up it was suppressed and they were either I don't think they were paid off but they were completely dismissed and this has to change women in the military been abused for many many years we're gonna shift this subject now to numerology and the significance of symbols and numbers in the Illuminati the Illuminati is and has been obsessed with symbols and numbers  and even astrology numbers create a vibrational frequency and there are tools used like sacred geometry and numerology to create very powerful energy vortices vortexes of energy there are certain cities around the world like Paris and and the tunnel where Lady Diana was killed that have very powerful vortex of psychic energy and supposedly she was killed by the Illuminati we're not gonna disagree with that we think it wasn't an accident but there were a lot of forces that came into play too and  lady died on his life because at that point she was a threat to the monarchy we've written about that in our books the Illuminati frequency use of frequency it can shift the magnetic field people's magnetic energy their consciousness and affect them on a very deep level and that's why they love to use numbers 13 as a popular number the number 666 which symbolizes the devil is commonly seen in your video just on numerology I think we should yeah what about the symbols that the Illuminati oh there's so many symbols  I'll just name a few because there's so many that it's it's fascinating because once you're aware of the symbols you're gonna start seeing them in logos and advertising everywhere you go the Chevron or square over a square you've seen the Chevron gas logo it's that where there's a square directly on top of the square and that basically means according to eye it means we control everything we control everything which is the Illuminati goal and Creed there's the red roads which is very symbolic of purity tarot cards were used  to pass on esoteric or secret knowledge terrors were the precursor to the actual playing card the new union regular playing card deck and but they use symbols a lot of symbology and it was mystical and it was esoteric known only to a few that's why the church condemned a tarot cards because then I was like evil or bad in and of themselves but the church wanted you to think that they were so that's why they kind of get a bad rap yeah the church was very threatened by people the people having too much power in the Middle Ages and  the Renaissance times so they they suppress the power of psychics Chandler's seers visionaries and an astrology knows people like that and they kill them and torture the women so that they could secretly use that power it's very deep it gets extremely involved and layered but we're just gonna cover the CliffsNotes there are a lot of symbols that are used by singers and musicians triangles pentagrams the eye of the Horus which is the all-seeing eye is he that a lot Egyptian symbols and occult symbols have been connected  with the Illuminati forever like the okay hand symbol that's covering the eye that symbolizes 666 the symbol of the beast and then there's the diamond hand symbol you see a lot of musicians or rappers throw in the diamond you see jay-z you know with the hand symbol the triangle the triangle an awful lot a lot of singers and pop singers will use that and also the triangle or the pyramid signifies wealth and enlightenment and the supreme hierarchy in society we actually believe that good always conquers evil so we want to encourage  you to not be discouraged or too scared by this information because we believe that if you practice very powerful good it will override anything that lately the Eye of Horus or the third eye is an ancient Egyptian symbol of protection royal power and good health as Karen mentioned it's it's called the all-seeing eye and it has been used by many music stars especially pop stars rappers hip-hop people have worn the eye of horus you can see Kanye wearing giant images of the Eye of Horus beyonce is  well known to have a character that she sort of morphs into on stage called Sasha Fierce she calls her Sasha Fierce and it's kind of her alter ego but a lot of people think that it's the Illuminati kind of taking over her persona or her body her mind it's like a demon spirit I've seen people say that they think it's like a demon spirit that overtakes Beyonce on stage and some people even think that jay-z indoctrinated Beyonce to believe in the Illuminati to behave in a certain way she her videos have  changed her music has changed over the years and so is Rihanna and noticed they become darker in subject matter I'm not judging that I like a lot of it but I noticed that there is an energy that has changed in both of those performers and I think it's interesting to think of the influences that might be there to hate somebody that was kind of an innocent girl and transformer into this powerful symbol that uses Egyptian symbology now and really almost dark energies in a lot of her work and a lot of her videos  Baphomet is a demon LOD it's the goat that many worship to get more money power and fame you're gonna see this goat like image Allah in the videos and clothing they're gonna notice it whenever you see a lot of hip-hop music now Baphomet you see or hear lyrics a lot of Rain Man many rappers have some Rainman songs or lyrics about Rain Man now that refers to the devil supposedly according to conspiracists Eminem and many other artists have mentioned Rain Man in their lyrics in the end some artists like  Eminem regret joining and signing the contract with the Illuminati but once you're in you can't there ain't no leaving so yeah just be careful what you're signing yes general I mean go in with your eyes wide open not eyes wide shut be cautious when you're a young music star or film actor or whatever make sure you know what you're getting into because the Illuminati uses occult rituals they use initiation rituals that are very heavy very dark and mind-control experiments like the MKULTRA program it was actually a real  program started by the CIA in the 1950s and many people think it still is continuing today and that they're using this it's also called monarch mind-control the monarch program I think that it used to control celebrities young celebrities especially when their their most vulnerable and they can do whatever they want with them a lot of this does involve some sex abuse and drug use and so that's why we want to caution people don't go into this naively and make sure you have adults that are supervising you all the time  kind of like what Kesha did with dr. Lewis and she ended up in court Kesha accused her producer dr. Luke of drugging and abusing her for a long time and she came back with some amazing music so good for you kasher pedophilia is part of ritual abuse to mind-control children particularly in entertainment Corey Feldman was a child star he's been talking about the pedophilia rings in Hollywood for many years in recent they just exposed a few of his abusers publicly takes a lot of courage to do that because they get shut down Corey  Feldman was very shut down on when he went on the view about 15 years ago and tried to talk about it earlier this year Elijah Wood who was the young star in Lord of the Rings I didn't remember he had these gigantic blue eyes he's a little tiny elf like sort of actor just adorable and he did come out spoke out this year against child ritual abuse the child abuse cult in Hollywood I'm not sure exactly what his experience was I just know that he was very outspoken about it unfortunately he had a mother  that cared enough to keep him away from the Hollywood parties where you know the executives tend to prey on young young kids that are getting into the industry so he was one that came out had the nerve to speak out about it there is an agenda by the Illuminati powers that as we mentioned to suppress the power of women and girls going back many thousands of years we wanted to mention who are some of the rich elite Illuminati and their associates while Disney is another example of an elite Illuminati member and you you hear a lot  of the rumors and the symbology and some of the dark stuff that happens some of the subliminal stuff you've seen in Disney cartoons over many decades lots of simpleness it's true there it's a change there's a lot of exactly there's a lot of messages and symbols that you a child wouldn't notice but somebody who knows what to look for can see most of the American presidents and vice presidents senators congressmen governors are believed to have some link to the Illuminati at these days I'm not questioning that some believe they were  placed into a position by the Illuminati to advance the group's goals of making money and consolidating their power again we said the Queen of England the Royal House of Windsor the hierarchy on the board of directors of the Vatican the Pope has been accused of having links to the Illuminati you know the Rothschilds the Rockefellers the most wealthy families bushes and clintons oleg to the Illuminati over the years that's fine and Donald Trump Trump himself you know 17 women have accused him of his salt and molestation and you  know he's the president so go figure I don't know this I think this is just shiny more of a light on what needs to change in our culture our society that will take orders in lockstep from somebody that has a no regard for women whatsoever so at any rate what do you think do you think the Illuminati is real do you think it's a bunch of hooey do you think it's just something conspiracy theory people deciding to hype to get more views on YouTube we happen to think that a lot there's a lot of truth in it if you care to look deep  enough and scratch the surface it's quite fascinating and it's those things where you don't really you you may never know it's sort of like god you're never gonna really know if there's a god but it with the Illuminati it may never be revealed the real truth may never ye reveal you have to sort of feel it and see it and experience it to know because it's an energy you definitely feel it if your intuitive you will feel it here in Halle you're in Hollywood you feel it and so go in with your eyes closed don't  miss part two next week we're going to talk more about celebrities that are thought to be members of the Illuminati group like Katy Perry Madonna Taylor Swift Michael Jackson and Prince so look forward to that hit like and subscribe and we'll see you in [Music] 	Center			Conservative	127
K247	https://youtu.be/hGqqwoFbG7M?si=LJoI4ooaLi4Y0Kki	At noon. A 38 year old man is dead after an alleged home invasion in Muskegon County early this morning. It happened just before two o'clock on Chatterson Road north of Apple and Eagleton Township. Deputies say they were called to a report of the man pounding on an apartment window before illegally entering the apartment. They say the man assaulted the tenant then tried to break into the connected home. That's when the homeowner shot the man who died from his injuries. Muskegon County deputies say they are still investigating that shooting  for the second. 	Leaning Conservative			Center	128

K278	https://youtu.be/ZJRNtiZqLaM?si=O1KLEC0R5DW5bw1D	all righty everyone so I think it's pretty Apparent at this point that the acolyte series is probably the worst Star Wars project in history given that the overall backlash is seemingly larger than the Last Jedi by Ryan Johnson back in 2016 or 17 I should say when you look at this actual series there's been a lot of problems happening with the production with the marketing with how Kathleen Kennedy and Leslie hedin have been promoting this thing as a 100% Dei focused SL agenda driven project that's  only driving fans away further however when it comes to Disney's financial situation and how this actually now involves Leslie hedin there's a lot to discuss here so stay tuned and let's discuss this is Mike zero subscribe if you're new and like this video to see future updates you can also follow me at Mike 01 I thank you also very much for the great and kind support So Kathleen Kennedy is definitely one of the worst producers in the entire Hollywood bubble not just because of how ignorant she is and how  self-absorbed she truly is when it comes to all of the movies and the TV shows that she spews out over at lucasfilm that just completely tarnishes what Star Wars once was and look at the same exact time we know that Kevin feige is equally doing the same to the Marvel Cinematic Universe that's exactly why Kevin feige was offered a job to become a part of a Star Wars movie which ultimately by the way never ended up happening all right that actually fell apart even as well the typical vicious cycle over at Lucas  film but what's interesting about this further has a lot to do with Leslie hedin's current impact at the Walt Disney Company and Lucas film specifically so let's let's go into exactly what's going on here now with both divisions at the Walt Disney Company like Marvel Studios and lucasfilm already beginning to fall apart due to Bob iger's poor decisions one major development has to do with showrunner and director of the acolyte series Leslie hedin and how she recently just cost Disney billions of dollars  across the board now one significant update to this situation involves how recently Kathleen Kennedy has been pressuring the Disney board of directors to allow Leslie hin to become the new vice president of lucasfilm in the near future as well as becoming a part of the lucasfilm story Group which means that she is able to gain creative power over all projects movies or TV shows however one thing that Leslie recently accomplished that cost Disney billions of dollars in Revenue was that she recently pushed Kathleen Kennedy to  reason with Bob AER and the rest of the board to officially cancel all Star Wars films and TV shows that were either in limbo from 2016 that were still in either development without a proper script that were going to hold No Agenda or ideology in those Star Wars projects that Disney analysts projected years ago would Garner billions of dollars in Revenue with the five films alone and the two TV shows that Leslie hedin recently got Bob Iger to cancel a recent emergency meeting did take place one  week ago in which Kathleen Kennedy aiger and the board discussed the new direction of Star Wars this is where Kennedy reflected Leslie's proposal for the change and the massive shift in Star Wars formats to cancel those Star Wars films and TV shows that held yes zero agenda the films that were recently cancelled due to Leslie hedin's proposal that was provided by Kathleen Kennedy vocally to the Disney heads included an entire Star Wars Trilogy focused and dedicated to the Old Republic era as well as two other films that were  planned to take place thousands of years after the events of the rise of Skywalker completely detaching from the sequel Trilogy films now the two TV shows that were also cancelled was George lucas' Star Wars underworld that was going to be resurrected from 2007 that never actually got finished this was going to be Star Wars meets Blade Runner essentially focusing on hidden Dark Side users and crime syndicates the other show that was cancelled was going to focus on the Mandalorian and Jedi Wars years before the traditional Star  Wars films all of these were recently asked since Leslie hedin found they held no representation of diversity equity and inclusion and these arguments were discussed with Kathleen Kennedy and she agreed that we're in turn address the bager and the board now reportedly it was clear from Kennedy that this was Leslie's proposal and Disney was fully on board with cancelling those Star Wars projects that were going to clearly focus on proper storytelling and character development and the true philosophy of star Wars and what George  had created the plan associated with this projects was to hire very famous and well-known writers and directors as well now guys let me stop here for one moment so not only were they going to focus on pretty and seemingly good stories I mean they sound amazing but they wanted to also get famous and well-known directors and writers to handle them now look I'm not saying that we're going to get someone like James Cameron per se maybe but someone on that here would have been involved in those Star Wars films sltv shows and that I  believe would have definitely created a shift or at least a slow you know fix to where Star Wars could possibly go and all of that is no longer on board it's no longer happening it was just vanished into the wind all because of Leslie hedin you know pretty much spewing all that nonsense to Kathleen Kennedy to bounce it back over to the Disney Board of director and Bob Iger and it seems like that they are all obsessed with any project that was either on the current slate or that was in limbo that held no  Disney agenda at all and they just want to ax all of it all right and they did this similar uh tactic with past Marvel films past Marvel TV showsmovies if you guys don't remember one year ago typical scenario now this is exactly why Kathleen Kennedy is reading Leslie hedin almost like her you know partner to a degree high up in the ranks over Lucas film she wants her to eventually become the vice president we talked about this a month ago however on top of this Leslie however is actively moving up in  the ranks at lucasfilm since Kennedy believes like I said hedin is the right director and schor to push and provide their agenda to new Star Wars fans that will accept whatever comes out and their first step with this was the acolyte series however some board members are already calling for acolyte season 2 to be canceled altogether after the ongoing backlash so again I mean if you think skeleton crew yet another Star Wars TV show that was delayed from 2023 until later this year that's also going to be  another agenda driven Star Wars TV show just as bad as the acolyte it may not be 100% female focused like that but it is going to be within that Dei range so again the fact fact that you know we've had these opportunities that were just there on the current slate not really moving forward but in the current slate that were going to eventually happen are no longer happening and completely axed by Bob AER all because Leslie hedin really just feeling like she's so important within the ranks over Lucas  film right and look we've never seen a series by her before so it's quite egotistical to actually do something like this to really kind of have that meeting with Kathleen Kennedy to convince the Disney board of directors to ask anything George Lucas focused or anything that George had endorsed years ago or anything that would actually have traditional zero agenda driven plot lines and story developments so overall I would love to hear what you all have to say about this ongoing situation related to what's been going on over at  lucasfilm and the Walt Disney Company etc etc and if you guys did enjoy the content for today make

K280	https://youtu.be/rXepkIWPhFQ?si=_HC0Wh7Iyqodtkp8	Good morning everybody. I'd like to talk about a couple of things today. The first thing is water. Now I see you've all been enjoying the water that's been provided for you here at the conference, over the past couple of days. And I'm sure you'll feel that it's from a safe source. But what if it wasn't? What if it was from a source like this? Then statistics would actually say that half of you would now be suffering with diarrhea. I talked a lot in the past about statistics, and the provision of safe drinking water for all.  But they just don't seem to get through. And I think I've worked out why. It's because, using current thinking, the scale of the problem just seems too huge to contemplate solving. So we just switch off: us, governments and aid agencies. Well, today, I'd like to show you that through thinking differently, the problem has been solved. By the way, since I've been speaking, another 13,000 people around the world are suffering now with diarrhea. And four children have just died. I invented Lifesaver bottle  because I got angry. I, like most of you, was sitting down, the day after Christmas in 2004, when I was watching the devastating news of the Asian tsunami as it rolled in, playing out on TV. The days and weeks that followed, people fleeing to the hills, being forced to drink contaminated water or face death. That really stuck with me. Then, a few months later, Hurricane Katrina slammed into the side of America. "Okay," I thought, "here's a First World country, let's see what they can do." Day one: nothing.  Day two: nothing. Do you know it took five days to get water to the Superdome? People were shooting each other on the streets for TV sets and water. That's when I decided I had to do something. Now I spent a lot of time in my garage, over the next weeks and months, and also in my kitchen -- much to the dismay of my wife. (Laughter) However, after a few failed prototypes, I finally came up with this, the Lifesaver bottle. Okay, now for the science bit. Before Lifesaver, the best hand filters were only capable  of filtering down to about 200 nanometers. The smallest bacteria is about 200 nanometers. So a 200-nanometer bacteria is going to get through a 200-nanometer hole. The smallest virus, on the other hand, is about 25 nanometers. So that's definitely going to get through those 200 nanometer holes. Lifesaver pores are 15 nanometers. So nothing is getting through. Okay, I'm going to give you a bit of a demonstration. Would you like to see that? I spent all the time setting this up, so I guess I should.  We're in the fine city of Oxford. So -- someone's done that up. Fine city of Oxford, so what I've done is I've gone and got some water from the River Cherwell, and the River Thames, that flow through here. And this is the water. But I got to thinking, you know, if we were in the middle of a flood zone in Bangladesh, the water wouldn't look like this. So I've gone and got some stuff to add into it. And this is from my pond. (Sniffs) (Coughs) Have a smell of that, mister cameraman. Okay. (Laughs) Right.  We're just going to pour that in there. Audience: Ugh! Michael Pritchard: Okay. We've got some runoff from a sewage plant farm. So I'm just going to put that in there. (Laughter) Put that in there. There we go. (Laughter) And some other bits and pieces, chuck that in there. And I've got a gift here from a friend of mine's rabbit. So we're just going to put that in there as well. (Laughter) Okay. (Laughter) Now. The Lifesaver bottle works really simply. You just scoop the water up. Today I'm going to use a jug  just to show you all. Let's get a bit of that poo in there. That's not dirty enough. Let's just stir that up a little bit. Okay, so I'm going to take this really filthy water, and put it in here. Do you want a drink yet? (Laughter) Okay. There we go. Replace the top. Give it a few pumps. Okay? That's all that's necessary. Now as soon as I pop the teat, sterile drinking water is going to come out. I've got to be quick. Okay, ready? There we go. Mind the electrics. That is safe, sterile drinking water.  (Applause) Cheers. (Applause) There you go Chris. (Applause) What's it taste of? Chris Anderson: Delicious. Michael Pritchard: Okay. Let's see Chris's program throughout the rest of the show. Okay? (Laughter) Okay. Lifesaver bottle is used by thousands of people around the world. It'll last for 6,000 liters. And when it's expired, using failsafe technology, the system will shut off, protecting the user. Pop the cartridge out. Pop a new one in. It's good for another 6,000 liters. So let's look at the applications.  Traditionally, in a crisis, what do we do? We ship water. Then, after a few weeks, we set up camps. And people are forced to come into the camps to get their safe drinking water. What happens when 20,000 people congregate in a camp? Diseases spread. More resources are required. The problem just becomes self-perpetuating. But by thinking differently, and shipping these, people can stay put. They can make their own sterile drinking water, and start to get on with rebuilding their homes and their lives.  Now, it doesn't require a natural disaster for this to work. Using the old thinking, of national infrastructure and pipe work, is too expensive. When you run the numbers on a calculator, you run out of noughts. So here is the "thinking different" bit. Instead of shipping water, and using man-made processes to do it, let's use Mother Nature. She's got a fantastic system. She picks the water up from there, desalinates it, for free, transports it over there, and dumps it onto the mountains, rivers, and streams.  And where do people live? Near water. All we've go to do is make it sterile. How do we do that? Well, we could use the Lifesaver bottle. Or we could use one of these. The same technology, in a jerry can. This will process 25,000 liters of water; that's good enough for a family of four, for three years. And how much does it cost? About half a cent a day to run. Thank you. (Applause) So, by thinking differently, and processing water at the point of use, mothers and children no longer have to walk four hours a day  to collect their water. They can get it from a source nearby. So with just eight billion dollars, we can hit the millennium goal's target of halving the number of people without access to safe drinking water. To put that into context, The U.K. government spends about 12 billion pounds a year on foreign aid. But why stop there? With 20 billion dollars, everyone can have access to safe drinking water. So the three-and-a-half billion people that suffer every year as a result, and the two million kids that die every year,  will live. Thank you. (Applause) 	Leaning Conservative			Center	131

K301	https://youtu.be/DvySPjX0F6w?si=1N4UOkNVW3B6kz-l	Discord doesn't want me to say this but when you sign up for Discord and agree to their terms of service you signed away your rights you agreed to not take Discord to court now I'm nowhere close to a lawyer but I'm going to explain what's going on why this is bad and how to opt out of this now to explain what's going on you might have seen in the news that a lot of people are talking about how Discord wants to void your right to sue them in court and all of these articles are popping up because recently  Discord updated their terms of service you know the thing that nobody reads and the most important part about discord's terms of service is this point here agreement to arbitrate so everything I'm going to talk about is for us residents but even as a non- US resident I find this stuff pretty interesting if you are a US resident you agree to the following mandatory arbitration provision oh we're getting Fancy with the words here gez basically if you want to sue Discord for whatever reason you can't just go to the  normal courts instead you have to do something called arbitration now I already know what you're thinking I'm not going to sue Discord I don't think I'm going to be suing Discord either but this agreement to arbitrate really cripples you because now instead of doing like class action lawsuits normal legal stuff you are forced to arbitrate and to explain how big of an issue this could potentially be let me show you how this arbitration would work if Discord did a little bit of a whoopsy Fu YY so  let's say Discord does what they do best make poor decisions and somehow and some point in the future Discord has a big data breach or maybe there's this massive cyber criminal group that use Discord to scam millions of people for billions of dollars and we figured out through a little bit of investigation that Discord did nothing to stop it or maybe it turns out that Discord was training your message messages on AI even though they said they wouldn't now let me be super clear I made these up these are hypothetical situations that  could happen in the future in reality Discord actually has been sued parents sued Discord because their children were experiencing what happens a lot on Discord unfortunately so this real life example plus all of those fake potential scenarios would be perfect for a class action lawsuit now do you see that handsome man on the screen yeah that's me and I definitely know what a class action lawsuit is and I didn't have to go on Wikipedia to figure it out but basically a class action lawsuit is where a whole bunch of people were  affected by something that Discord might have done let's say there was a data breach well all of those people will group up and they will be represented collectively by a couple of lawyers and they will sue Discord for buckets of money man it'd be nice to have some of that money right well you can't because you agreed to arbitrate you cannot be part of the class action lawsuits that means if Discord did anything stupid and you want to sue Discord you literally need to One V one discord's legal team  through arbitration and it's not just Discord arbitration process but you also agreed to discord's dispute process and again you agreed to this because you agreed to the terms of service now it's never a good idea to trust a Discord YouTuber about legal stuff but I took a look around the internet and there are articles where it talks about people opposing forced arbitration and the reasons why they oppose arbitration is first that individuals are often unaware that they agreed to force arbitration  let's be honest before this video even started did you have any clue that this existed media did a pretty good job with all their news articles but you probably had had no idea which is a bad thing because the second issue with forced arbitration is that it limits what you can do for resolving a dispute you don't have the public courts anymore you have to go through discord's process of arbitration and how does that look like well if you want to settle a dispute between you and Discord welcome to  discord's Legal Gauntlet of Doom so let's say Discord did the most heinous crime on the planet they stole my copy of Luigi's Mansion on the GameCube well since I agreed to discord's terms of service I also agreed to reaching out to Discord before initiating a lawsuit or arbitration and to do that I need to email Discord with my information and a detailed description of the issue and how I'd like them to resolve it now this is where things get interesting because Discord for the next 60 days are going  to try and Gaslight me into thinking that this is not a big deal you didn't need Luigi's Mansion it was actually ours in the first place I realize this example isn't making a whole lot of sense but Within These 60 days Discord and their legal team in my opinion are going to try and Gaslight you into thinking it's not a big deal you shouldn't try to sue us or take us to arbitration that's expensive just take $20 and be on your way but if you see through their shadiness and you decide to take them to court well you can't  because you agreed to arbitration so now it's time to go to arbitration now what is arbitration well Discord outlines what it is but holy it is dense and boring and it really doesn't matter about the details because you're going to be opting out which I'll show you how to do later and you should do that but arbitration is kind of this informal Court you have Discord in their lawyer you and hopefully your lawyer and then you have an arbitrator in the middle who is usually an ex judge who will hear  both sides of the stories what damages you want Etc all the details so the arbitrator will use all that information and the Tonk of gears in their brain to make a decision and this is where things start to get bad and why this whole arbitration Clause is bad because here's the thing discord's arbitration is binding on both you and Discord so what that means is once the arbitrator comes to a conclusion you have to do what they say you can't appeal it and remember that website made by people who knew  what they were talking about well they also pointed out the same issue arbitration is a private system without a judge jury or a right to appeal so we know that once the arbitrator makes their decision you can't appeal it that's just how it is but things are even worse because arbitrators aren't required to take the law and legal president into account in making their decisions so any passed legal case they're not going to think about that and the thing that really ticks me off the most is the fact that there is no  appeal or public review of any of the decisions all of this is private if this isn't public then people don't know what bad stuff Discord has done because it's all settled private behind closed doors no one can know about it and do you want to know the best part about Discord forcing you to arbitrate it's the fact that you've been forced to arbitrate since 2018 back on October 16th of 2018 Discord made a blog post talking about the terms of service feedback and changes and during this time they  introduced their new arbitration and class action waiver clause and the thing about this article is that it actually peels back the curtain a little bit because Discord explains why they changed it this is what Discord wants you to think when in reality it's a little bit different Discord says that the current legal landscape in the United States of America is such that class action lawsuits can be abused we at Discord are just trying to protect ourselves from the evil people it seems rational but let's actually see what the  reality is Discord doesn't want any class action lawsuit against them even if Discord makes a royal up if they leak all of your data they don't want to be involved in a class action lawsuit this is solely used to reduce discord's liability most people aren't going to solo 1 V one monway mono discord's legal team because they are corporate lawyers those people aren't human they're aliens but class action lawsuit lawyers are a whole different breed of monster and with a class action lawsuit it's just a  lot easier to sue Discord because they do all the work for you but if you agree to arbitrate you can't be in a class action lawsuit because you didn't opt out and if you're not part of the class action lawsuit then Discord doesn't have to pay as much money which explains why they force you to arbitrate but the thing is is that not everything is black and white because class lawsuits have a lot of cons and a lot of Pros for example there was a class action lawsuit against Facebook in Canada where they  used a whole bunch of people's faces for sponsored stories and they sued them for a whopping 51 million Canadian dollars and what do you get for being in Facebook's ad without your consent $200 $51 million and you get $200 so uh where did the $51 million go well it goes to those good old class action lawyers who probably use it to like I don't know buy anothering yacht or something for legal reasons this is my opinion please do not sue me but the benefits of class action lawsuits is that it punishes Discord a  lot if Discord had to pay $51 million for their big Royal up that is a good punishment and Discord wants to avoid being punished so they're going to be a good company and discord's going to be more inclined to do that if everyone opts out of the arbitration Clause now just like class action lawsuits arbitration is a mix of both good and bad it's not just 100% evil or 100% positive it's confusing as all heck because arbitration itself is really expensive but if you look through discord's arbitration agreement they  actually do something pretty good you're going to be responsible for the first $100 towards the filing fee and if you're seeking less than $75,000 Discord will pay the remainder of the filing fee and both parties administrative fees unless of course the arbitrator finds that you're making a completely bogus legal statement or it's frivolous but Discord will cover your costs assuming you're not trying to seek more than $75,000 so that is a benefit but if you take a step back back and think about it  for a second Discord would much rather pay $75,000 than you know $51 million so uh business-wise it makes a whole bunch of sense for Discord to do this and for the rest of the pros and cons about arbitration funny enough Discord actually put them in their terms of service blog post because if you scroll down they have a whole bunch of resources but they have this article here pointing out how someone can abuse class action lawsuits and if we open it up it talks about how Netflix class action lawsuit shows that class action  lawsuits are mostly about making lawyers Rich which I can agree with this however they also made a blog post as a Counterpoint here's another article by the same dude detailing how arbitration is not much better and if we open it up it says that the system may be bad but arbitration is worse and the thing about this article that I really want to point out is that they say in cases between businesses and individuals which most likely will happen if you go to arbitration with Discord businesses win  nearly 97% of the time 97 % and it's not hard to see why because arbitrators are usually chosen jointly by both parties but the companies are the ones that are going to be back for more and more arbitration and if an arbitrator rules against the company then they won't be on the future list at all like these people say it doesn't take a genius in Game Theory to recognize that the arbitrator will be under tremendous pressure to side with a company so that they can you know keep their job everyone is about self-preservation and  the companies exploit it so that they win 97% % of the time all right I'm going to stop role playing AA Goodman and I'm just going to hit it with you straight if this arbitration agreement was meant to protect you only Discord wouldn't force you to arbitrate this arbitration agreement is only to protect discord's best interests so instead of losing 97% of the time let's figure out how to opt out of this agreement you can actually opt out of arbitration by emailing an opt out notice to Discord which I'll show you how to do but the  main thing I want to point out is that if you opt out of arbitration nothing will happen to your Discord account you won't be punished nothing now the super important thing is that you have a time limit when you can opt out and right now you need to opt out within 30 days of April 15th 2024 so that means that you need to opt out by May 15th which is pretty soon so get on it right now and just as a side note if you register your Discord account you can opt out within 30 days of making it but you're a  Discord degenerate you've been on Discord for multiple years I know you but like I said at the beginning this only applies to people in the United States if you ain't part of America you don't need to worry about any of this and you can click off the video now bye-bye I love you m all right my freedom people let's do this opou so what you need to do is you need to send an email to arbitration optout discord.com again this will be in the description just copy and paste it so you don't mess anything up for the  subject line we're going to do arbitration opt out- user ID we're going to fill out the user ID a little bit later and then copy and paste the body of the email now we need to replace this user ID email and name with actual information so I filled out both the email and the name because that's obvious but now we need to find our user ID which you might have not done before but what you need to do is you need to go into Discord go to your user settings scroll down to Advanced then you need to enable developer mode once you do that  go into any one of your Discord servers send a message then right click your name and click copy user ID this is a unique number that identifies your Discord account and we need to include this because if you change your account's email you you kind of just want a paper trail okay this is just covering your apps so we got this big number we're going to go into Discord and we are going to replace user ID with that number both in the subject line and also in the body where it says user ID now at this point if you're American  click on that big send button baby you want to send this email to Discord and also make sure to save this email keep this for your records in case you ever do need to sue Discord which hopefully you don't have to but again I'm surprised every day by what happens on Discord because every day you just you just get your brain rotted even more that's all I got Gamers uh hopefully the legal argon that I was explaining was actually tolerable and chances are while I'm editing this thing I'm going to try  my best to make it somehow enjoyable if I did it good job me I'm giving myself a pat on the back anyways that's enough inflating my ego I'm going to call it quits I love you gamer m 	Leaning Liberal			Conservative	133
K332	https://youtu.be/huvStjScFvM?si=0igfmxqDcCjIHox9	well hey B it's Jamie D me here welcome back to the channel honey listen I want to get into some things and what I want to talk about is this teacher over on Tik Tok who has his students taking down his braids I guess he has a hair appointment of some sort and I want to get into it um I've been saying it swarm all around social media but I have not actually gotten a chance to really check it out wholeheartedly so we're about to do that together okay make sure that you guys are indeed coming into the video  you are liking up the channel okay subscribing to the channel as well if you're not subscribed and make sure that you're cutting on your notification Bells okay so without further Ado let us go ahead and hop into this video to see exactly what uh this teacher has to say about this um let's check it out stream my students helping me take my hair out there was quite the discourse in the chat which had people saying this was inappropriate and other people saying this was completely fine there was nothing wrong with what I was doing and  people were just making it weird so of course I had to bring this issue to the big stage I would like to represent myself in this case your honor if I may number one for little context I had a hair appointment immediately after school and I needed my hair taken out beforehand I would have taken it out the night before but that Friday we had a camera crew coming in to shoot a promotional video and I was one of the ones being interviewed so I had to look presentable so I didn't take my hair out I didn't have the time to do it  all myself cuz it would have taken me forever so naturally I asked about four or five of my over over a 100 best friends to assist me in taking my hair out and they all agreed number two this was at the end of class this week we were doing stem fair presentations since it was Friday and all of my students did an excellent job on their stem fair projects and presentations I told them if we get one solid presentation in this class I'll end class a little early and they can have fun and play basketball  darts or be on their phones or whatever and during that time my team would help me take my hair out a couple of these were students from my class but others were students from other classes I would all of them a pass at the beginning of the class period requesting their assistance 10 minutes before dismissal I told the teachers only send them if all of their work was completed and they had good behavior they all met the criteria so 10 minutes before dismissal they showed up for their job my next point I  like to make is if I was a female teacher those people wouldn't be in the comments saying oh this is weird this is inappropriate cuz me personally I don't think there's anything weird about this people are saying oh that's too intimate to me it's literally just hair it doesn't have to be weird some people have never had cool teachers in the shows I personally believe that building authentic relationships with students is Paramount in being an Effective Teacher I make sure my students know and can  feel that I care about them beyond the schoolwork and all the stuff that I have to make them do I take the time to get to know my students outside of academics because caring for the whole child is what's important some of these students have been with me since I was was a substitute 4 years ago they see me as a big brother or a father figure as some of them say and me I don't want kids of my own so all of these kids are literally my children and in case you're wondering about their parents most of  them follow me on social media and always talk about my videos with their kids they always tell me that they're so grateful that their kids have someone like me in their life and my admin they're well aware of my social media presence and they love my videos to me this is just another wholesome moment that I'm having with my kids that I was fortunate enough to catch on film since I'm a science teacher one thing that I teach my students about is symbiosis symbiosis deals with the relationships between organisms the type of  relationship that I like to Foster in my class is mutualism or mutualistic relationship which means both organisms benefit from The Exchange so when my students have good behavior complete all their assignments and do everything that a scholar is supposed to do I reward them with downtime and just time to just be a kid be on their phones play games gossip so on and so forth my students and I work hard and we play harder I'm fortunate enough to have students that feel safe and comfortable around me safe  to come to me with their problems their frustrations they come to me seeking guidance and wisdom or come to me simply to chill and hang out because they know that they have a safe space to be themselves around me what I strive to do as an educator is be the teacher I wish I had grown up I strive to be the teacher that makes my inner child happy someone that my inner child would be proud of I want to be the teacher that my students reflect back on 20 30 years down the line and think like dang that  teacher I had in middle school he was the no further questions your honor so let me know your thoughts in the comments you think this was inappropriate or people are making something out of nothing and although you are entitled to your opinion all I ask is that you be resp respectful thank you all right so y'all just got a chance to check out that video and you know when I first saw it um my initial thought was like oh this is so inappropriate like what the hell does he think he doing and you know after I  listened to this video just now um nothing has changed I still feel the same goddamn way I felt the first time you could play however much classical music you want to play and talk as soft as you want to talk but in my personal this is uh inappropriate um I feel like everything that he said he was on point with um you know the relationships between students and teachers but then also when you allow students to get this comfortable in spaces it could lead to inappropriate behavior or misunderstandings of some sort um in my  personal and you know he talks about you know I feel like a lot of you people may have never had a cool teacher and I understand that but then at the same time a lot of people have had cool teachers in the school and a lot of times not all but quite a bit of the times those cool teachers have been caught up in rumors of them doing inappropriate things with students so why would you want to put yourself in a position for that to possibly happen where somebody could put these allegations out there on you and then  some of the videos like this they use against you in court at some point you know what I'm saying um and you know how one would set it up you know in court or whatever they can all easily turn a simple video as a lot of people may view it like this one into something that's extremely like salacious or whatever we see it all the time with media but um yeah I I I'm just I understood what he was saying and it was really the soft classical music and you listening and it's like okay I see what you're saying but no my dog  like that's still inappropriate um to me I just can't and I'm not going to let my child take nobody hair down especially a stranger if you ain't going to pay like run my kid their coins what this supposed to be for extra credit or some something or something like what is we why what was the purpose of even filming this and putting this off on social media and see the other thing for me is it's the students identity what if I'm a parent who don't post my child on social media and what if I'm trying to you know  conceal the school that my child goes to and you're over here putting them on display on social media like I kind of feel way about that you know even though he tried to you know answer that too and say most of my students or some of my students parents know that I put them on social media yeah I hear you say that but do we know that those children's parents know that you put them on social media you see what I'm saying um I probably would have felt the way if I would have saw that video and that was  my child in the video like what the like explain this situ why you got my child taking your hair down like what is that about you ain't give me no call ahead of time I understand it was like at the last few minutes of class and these are some of the good students some of my best students are the ones that I had come and they were so great in school they were so fantastic that I chose them to take my hair down like m I feel like that's still giving a bit of tacky in my personal I do feel like um  in my personal it was just it was inappropriate I understand that you're on crunch time and I understand that you have a hair appointment and things that you need to get done but I also feel like you should have did it yourself okay I hate to say it like I mean or just pay a five pay the five if you can afford to pay the five pay the five and just have somebody just had a person take your hair down on you get there to get your hair done you know um it did you know as I I mean to me it did kind of look a bit innocent as  I'm watching and I'm listening to him talk you know um but at the same time as innocent as it may have seem with the young ladies taking the hair down it still seemed a bit inappropriate especially for you to want to film it for social media and put them on display like that's my biggest thing like what if somebody's trying not to let everybody know what school they child attends and you got they ass all on social media like did you get clearance for that was there a letter that sent that was sent home for the parents that  was an approval of oh hey um can we get your permission you know sometimes what we like to do is we like to film um you know Tik toks and just want to get your approval that it's okay for your child to be filmed on Tik Tok like I ain't like that um and then another thing he said that a lot of my students see me as a big brother this that that and the other um that's a lot that's not all you don't know how those kids may see you you know a lot of times I do feel like you have older people teachers and stuff  who are just trying to be kind to you know the students or whatnot and they may take that kindness in a different type of way it's been plenty of times I know when I was in school around their age I would hear some of my friends and others have a crush on one of the handsome teachers in school or whatever not that the teacher will ever cross the line with them but you know doing little stuff like this make them feel like oh I probably got a chance or whatever ain't no telling what's going on with these  people heads so in these in these kids heads I just feel like when it's a situation like this in my personal I just um let's lower these type of conversations from happening by not engaging in this type of stuff I mean you know that's just like I just I don't know y'all I I mean I understand how people want to water it down and say oh you know it's just hair it's really not that big of a deal like it's not that deep but as soon as y'all come out with something soon as something happen or pop off y'all will be using this very  video as a reference to explain said person's poor Behavior you know what I'm saying like y'all should have known when y'all saw this D if this man got caught up in some stuff in the past or anything in the future this is going to be a video used to reference any allegations like you know and then I feel like I know you're trying to be you know a great person to these students a teacher that cares about them outside of school and all of that and I get that and I do think we need teachers like that but at  the same time I feel like if you're if you got them taking your hair down in class what other things do you have them doing that makes them feel a bit too comfortable to where if it came down to a situation of getting themselves or or you out of trouble they'll like they may just throw some allegations out there on you and then now you're having to defend yourself like I just yeah I can't let it fly for me you know I mean but if that's what everybody else feels and that's how y'all Rock like it's not that deep it's just hair  and if you people that are saying it's just hair have children and you feel like you'll be okay with then cool um if you're a person that probably don't have no kids and you looking at it like hey you know um I think nothing's wrong with that well then maybe when you have your child you might feel the same or you might feel differently I know me as a parent I don't want no like that okay I don't want my child taking your hair down okay I feel like you can be a friend to a student and also have clear  clear lines for them to know that I'm your teacher okay don't get too friendly with me think you going to come over here and take my hair down or none of that like it's a way to be cool and then it's also a way to you know draw the line just like you know as being a parent knowing that you are you know in a position of authority but also at the same time like not being too um I guess uh I don't want to say harsh but harsh of a lack of lack of better word not being too distant with your kid that  they can't have honest conversations with you and all of that so it's just like really I I just I for me as a parent I would not want my child taking down a teacher's hair uh male or female okay um son or daughter meaning teacher meaning whether the teacher is a woman whether the teacher is a man whether my child is a girl but what I don't want them participating in that and I damn sure don't want nobody putting my child on social media as you're sitting there what it looks like your School logo on  it so people know like I mean I think that's my biggest issue and that's crazy because it's really bigger than them taking down the hair in a sense it's like like how you know these parents really want their child on camera and then it being on display where they child go to school at like I don't know I don't really like this but I'm going let y'all do what y'all want to do cuz y'all going to do it do that anyway cuz how y'all is hello but y'all leave y thoughts in comments down below and let me know whether you felt like it was  that big of a deal whether you felt like it wasn't a big that big of a deal and keep in mind this my personal my personal ain't your personal okay and that's okay don't be trying to attack me girl for my personal cuz I don't see stuff the way that you do understand and I'm probably never going to see it the same way but that's just where we at all right so you guys leave your thoughts and comments down below I'm Jamie that's me uh follow me on Instagram and Twitter at Jamie that's me and I will catch you  guys in the next one bye-bye my city

M8	https://youtu.be/hHoGDXj0xPc?si=ETX0B6i7x8bB7k7Y	[Music] [Music] all right hey welcome folks milspec Ops here it's going to be your sitre it's 44 2024 we're coming to you live here from the Monkey Lounge in the great state of Texas as we get into the Deets we're going to talk about a lot of different things we're talking about this high alert that has been issued uh you've got uh Iran basically making uh a lot of bold statements that they're going to come after not only Israel for the consulant bom bombing but they're also coming after the United States um the  irony in that is uh it just can't make this stuff up it's absolutely crazy because the sheer fact of the matter is we are the ones that have enabled all of their military uh nuclear um missile program operations right we've we've we've given them $400 million uh through the Obama Administration flying c130s in with pallets and pallets of unmarked cash uh all kinds of different things which we know they have used to fund terrorist operations and we continue to unravel and unlock all of the sanctions  that were put on against them to enable that missile program and yet they turn right back around and tell us hey we're coming after you just because we don't like you uh you are the Infidel right and so anyway Let's uh we're going to talk about that we're going talk about some of this craziness as it relates to this this solar eclipse coming up it makes zero sense we're going to talk about uh some biomics things because it's a it's humorous but it's in a bad way um because uh as we laugh we almost  go into a hysterical cry because um we are basically I you it just doesn't make any sense we we're going to talk spr we're going to talk about uh just the multitude of things that this Administration is doing um that shows you that we are not prepared for War uh that we are uh just at a very frail and fragile state that um our enemies have a very short window to react assuming Trump gets in now if Trump doesn't get in because of some other Shenanigans at play that prevent him from coming in um then uh it's probably still going to be  game on because uh this Administration is extremely weak and um of course we know who is really calling the shots which would be uh ideally that's going to be our deep State okay that shadow government that we all hear about so let me do this I'm going to jump over here real quickly I do want to point out the fact that um if if you have haven't been on this quilt this is an amazing handmade quilt my wife made it I will tell you uh the quality of this thing it's heavyweight it's um uh it's just it's art it really is it's absolutely  amazing it's an 80 by 80 inch quilt Uh current bid this is uh we're raising money for warrior tradition fund which is a 503c

monkeyy tag on here and it is like I said you're going to love it you will be blessed by this I promise you it's an amazing amazing quilt all right let's do this let's jump over here to uh Sky glass as we start off in Europe which is a little bit unusual for us we're just going to get  kind of a bottom up uh count uh 136 uh aircraft currently up across Europe now if I take it over to the conus uh you're going to see we're sitting at uh roughly 221 now I've stripped out 112 text twos 35 t38 and 44 ec45 trainers those things are no longer on the screen you can't see them but all you do see are military aircraft including these mil Intel balloons that are over the United States and we're going to talk a little bit more about some others that are also up that uh aren't showing on this so let's  do this jump over into our watch list real fast and you will see there's one we'll talk more about that that's another hubal just just got airborne and um and then everything else looks to be kind of the norm the ones that catch my I got a couple that catch my one is this gray bird this is uh Phoenix air right uh those are agency Birds they look to be coming into Texas very close to Houston and then if we go up a little further you see a lot of air refuelers a lot of Navy p8s that's kind of usual uh  that right there that's uh that's not the right picture for some reason it uh just wants to give me something other than what is really in that box but that's going to be your doomsday bird and then that is the accurate picture that is Air Force 2 so Bob Marley looks to be airborne and on the move and then as we get over here to Europe just you'll see a lot of e3 centuries um what you don't see are the German Intel balloons they don't uh seem to be showing right now that I don't believe is an accurate picture that's  the Swedish and I think that's an Intel bird and then this E3 Century we go down a little further that uh again if I click on the picture it gives me an awax not accurate um but that is uh one of those Italian Intel aircraft and then this another E3 Century over over kind of the Mediterranean there towards Cyprus all right let's go to Intel and just notice big transitions I see some broken traces off towards Hawaii um and then of course I am looking at uh some stuff down to uh looks like Port St Lucy  Florida that uh keep in mind there is a nuclear reactor down there that is always a concern very close to Trump all right um other than that it looked like the normal uh and then let's go over here to the awak side of the house and um the interesting piece of this when we talk about tempos there are a lot of uh the same like every this is a 3-day cycle give you an example uh let's see E3 centuries 22 of them all right here we are again 22 uh that looks to be kind of the standard right now we've established from a baseline  perspective and just notice the locations look to be kind of in the same general area they always are uh doing a lot of the man- INE middle stuff United States a little bit different I do see one that headed uh over towards Reno uh we've been talking a lot about Reno one up to Alaska right over Texas and uh that kind of covers it so that is going to be awax now let's talk agency boys this is uh uh your gray Birds right and just notice uh the flurry of activity down towards the southern side of the um California notice the broken  traces as always that we've seen uh notice this one it goes into Montana all right uh that's important when we look at the r135 you'll see uh very similar flights uh flight patterns all right and nothing I got nothing over Europe or Africa all right now let's go here let's talk uh let's talk R1 35s for a minute start off in Europe exact same locations they've always been we just see them kind of in and out of Sweden across up to Finland this right here tells me they're looking very closely at at the Russians in that that area right  remember these are sidel looking aircraft and so um and then of course uh around Taiwan remember Taiwan just had a .5 earthquake that took place or 7.4 um but uh then notice that again we just saw the agency aircraft going into uh Montana then I see the side looking as they always are in that same general area just pay attention if you're up into in that region okay all right c17s now notice the traces to Hawaii are significantly less that tells me that everything that was coming out of Hawaii headed over to Europe getting deployed  um is uh is already there right probably f-22s if I had to guess East Coast pretty busy but our actual number of c17s for a three-day count is only at 216 um versus 371 now the big thing notice the big traces going into uh Ramstein look how thick the traces are from Ramstein into the Middle East and then it was a pretty thick Trace that dropped into jalter area there near Portugal and Spain uh right at that little pinch Point going into the med that looks like they're still doing a lot of air drops into Gaza right uh I  see high altitude c17s there and then of course I see little thick traces going into uh Bahrain and um and then we get over here to Asia and you again will see that uh okanawa up to Japan and then Australia has got their normal normal stuff as well all right so now let's talk a 60s the number last time we got together 610 3 days right uh well actually 5 days was 1,025 3 days was 610 3 days yet again today is 610 so uh like I said that uh that whole Tempo and Rhythm uh that happens when it comes to the Military  and Commercial very similar in nature lot of the same patterns a lot of the same locations that they look and um you can see United States is very very very active and busy Europe not so much now if you were having a very large exercise going on as they have told us they were uh you would see a lot more and we're not seeing that okay uh which tells me that that exercise is uh that's a front for something else which is probably a spring offensive uh against Russia right in Ukraine uh try and push them back and  so you can see a little bit of stuff there in Asia a little bit of stuff there in Australia but really nothing major to speak of so okay back to our main uh one thing I did want to point out let's look at the air refuelers and you will see here domestically in the United States that the KC 135 22 and the b76 uh 7200 Pegasus are seven um just note the locations uh Florida very heavy uh in terms of Florida air traffic what I don't see are the normal we would see uh out here to this Texas border okay  and um uh but looks like they're just getting up and getting active so all right let me hide those and we'll get rid of those traces um all right now let's get into the news piece of this uh going to talk specifically about this eclipse coming on Monday now if you're in the area of this path and you see red or yellow that means that you are not going to see an eclipse that means the cloud cover that's what this is the cloud cover is going to be so thick that the only thing you will see is it go dark for about  four minutes and then go away now why are people freaking out over this particular Eclipse I have no idea I've never in a million years seen well I haven't been around a million years but you get my point it's it's just absurd and it makes zero sense unless the mainstream media the mocking bird media has been told to put a fear into people for some crazy reason it's the only thing you would think after they saw the fact that this is all going to be covered in clouds almost the entire path from the Texas border probably even in  Mexico all the way up until you get to the very tip up here where it is green if you're in this green area you'll be able to see the eclipse you won't be able to see the totality of the eclipse you'll be able to see some of it um because you won't be covered by clouds everybody else you ain't seeing any of it in fact like I said it'll go dark for about four minutes and that's it so why tell people continue to tell people oh you need to have food supply and water and uh you know all of this other crazy  stuff that they're issuing These Warnings and alerts for states of emergency for an eclipse you think it's the only one that has come across uh uh the the the world um in in probably you know our lifetime it's just it's absolutely nuts so uh check this out speaking of nuts Texas do basically telling truckers Hey listen we're having a standown you're not allowed to be on the road during this time from Midnight to midnight the following uh counties and you can see it right here just the County strip where  the total eclipse is going to be uh you're not supposed to have any trucks on the road let's see how many people adhere to that probably not and I doubt it will be en fored but uh they're putting that out there and uh it just goes to show you how stupid this is right okay moving on from that now this is absolutely amazing to me uh that we continue to allow this and this just goes to show you how how much power people can have right in terms of masses and the fact that they continue to breach the El Paso border barriers uh  this is after the one in March where they just all stormed it and rushed it and then the judge let them all go because there are no repercussions because they didn't get incarcerated because he didn't get kicked out of the country they're going to continue to do it and so um and this is a small amount of people imagine what a very large amount of people can do all right go to Sri Lanka and watch them take over the consulate there or the presidential house and everything else that happened when that became a failed State uh yeah  you start putting people in numbers and uh there isn't a lot uh the military can do about it all right other than try to contain it so all right we're moving on um but a little breath of fresh air this is going to be uh Swift air again this is a huge migrant moving machine uh just FYI they are going out of business in about two days um I think it is April 6th is their due date it may be today but I think it's April 6th uh that they will no longer be they filed bankruptcy and they will no longer be in operation  that means we're going to lose sight of the people coming into our country at least being able to track it monitor it what will end up happening is they will get uh vouchers and they'll put them on commercial airlines like American and Delta United uh Southwest everybody in their brother Spirit whoever they can get them on and they'll just start flying them in and then at that point we have we won't be able to see him other than somebody sitting next to a guy with a packet in his hand all right  okay this uh this is the uh the main story here uh as Israel beefs up air defenses they call up troops and basically Iran is saying it's going to be payback for the Syrian strike at the consulant general location and um yeah this is a pretty big deal uh so Israel is kind of on the edge of their seat waiting for some type of a response this could actually escalate very quickly this could actually what bring about brings about um Isaiah 17 where Damascus is no more if Israel pushes in uh a nuke into Damascus and they uh they decide to  pop something off into Israel uh Israel is going to take out Damascus it'll be gone uh Isaiah 17 says we'll wake up and it will be no more so uh there won't be no any fuzz on it where people are like um I wonder if that's Isaiah 17 no you will know 100% all right okay now this uh coming from our deep State Authority this is going to be the CIA actually warns that Iran will attack Israel within 48 Hours uh we're down to I guess the this about 24 hours left of that warning now keep in mind that they are also saying that uh Iran  is saying that uh they got a beef with us as well so uh stay frosty uh have a plan because if this thing goes south uh it's going to be complete chaos people are going to be really uh very confused and dazed if it happens domestically now I do want to point out something when we start talking about these guys we start talking about the Deep state if you go back to uh a Blog that I wrote in uh just the last month uh it's called operation Northwood uh Northwoods if you're not familiar with that go read  that blog it's at Monkey Works us.com uh under my blogs operation Northwoods that is when the United States government decided um that they were going to bait the American people and fake an attack uh it would have been a real Attack been a false flag uh event on us soil of a major terrorist attack they were going to have uh everything from airplanes hit and buildings to um you know people just getting shot up all over the place kind of crazy to think that our government could do something like that huh well not really actually  the more we learn about a government I think the more we realize that they're very capable of this uh and it kind of makes question 911 because this is along the same lines but their whole premise behind that was to spark a war to take out Fidel Castro right again um this was back during the the Cold War this was uh just after the Bay of Pigs incident happened that got Alan doues the director of the CIA the longest standing director removed from power and we believe that is why the motive behind  Alan doues and his intelligence Community to take out JFK all right now we'll move on from that but uh it's uh don't think for a second that they're not capable of doing something along those lines and blaming it on somebody else I.E Iran okay okay here we go this is Thursday the 4th and it looks like he's putting on his jams yeah questionable uh we have had her reports that he walks around U buck naked in the white house at night that uh he just uh going out around 2: a.m. looking for some ice cream I guess  but um anyway he does put on his jams I suppose maybe little onesie um but uh you know it looks like he's starting at 10 wrapping up at 5 and he's going to have a celebration of Greek Independence Day maybe he'll declare that a day of uh I don't know whatever he'll he'll declare it for something because the guy's just and then he'll forget it declared it so all right Biden loses swing state uh in the latest poll he loses most swing states in the latest poll as disapproval grows yeah I don't think he's got any real  approval I think uh they're trying to bake in some some fake approval so that uh if they do something else like they did last time uh we will all uh well at least we won't but there'll be many people that believe that he actually uh got the majority vote so um that is if we even have an election but uh anyway you can see uh Larry Mo and early up here on the stage um yeah let's just move on uh this like a wave of nausea hits you when you see those three their faces just it's disgusting okay this this ought to tell you just  how um incompetent the current Administration is so they say that they're nixing the plan to refill strategic petroleum Reserve because it's too expensive right remember he said well if it gets down below $72 a barrel we're going to refill it all um well yeah that didn't happen in fact it didn't get down to that low started 1975 it's at its lowest level it's ever been let's go take a look at the graph let's just um just throw that out there this is a a kind of an interesting deal uh but this is uh  let me turn off the dot this shows you where we are 17 days of strategic petroleum Reserve right there okay look at the bleed off think about when uh that bleed started was uh he came into office he sold a bunch of it to China of all people and then uh instead now keep in mind we are the biggest exporter of of petroleum in the United States why do we not take uh some of that export and refill this right just take it uh you know ban export for 30 days replenish this because what this does is uh if for  some reason we go to war uh and the military needs to be able to keep things going there you go right there again you're basically taking away uh capability uh which is a national security threat to our US military by doing that right there all right intentional folks that's not an accident all right okay let's go back over here so we get into the next piece the Navy reveals they have a major ship building delay as global war risk elevates yeah they're saying hey you know what we cannot uh we can't make what we need  can't get it out in the field uh everything is backed up we don't have the parts we don't have the labor we don't have anything to do exactly what it is we need to do to go fight a war now we've heard this on a multitude of other things right artillery 155 mm uh artillery shells we we just can't make enough of it we've given Ukraine everything they had and they've already blown through it all and now we are short uh Stinger missiles oh hey by the way they don't make those anymore so everything you just gave to  Ukraine uh guess what yeah it'll come back online about two years when Ron re uh Wickers the entire program because it's all been mothball all the tools everything's been sheld scrapped whatever it may be and oh by the way it's outdated techn ology so we have to update it to current standards so that uh you know we can actually put something in the field that'll work so that's that aspect now you go back and you look at Afghanistan and the fact that we left 12 billion worth of equipment out in the desert that is  still good and still usable and uh and then you basically watch that stuff just kind of disappear into the cracks and it starts showing up in random weird places yeah right this is intent like I said all right you know what I love this right here election day will be Christian visibility day uh yeah just leaving I'm just going to park that right there for you uh remember what uh flashbang just came out and said uh that Easter the day that our Lord and savior was crucified uh For All Mankind that redeemed you and enabled  you to go to heaven uh because otherwise you're not going right there's only one path and that's through Jesus Christ all right his blood on the cross paid for your sins past present and future in full Right comes out on that day and says hey this is uh National transgender visibility day give me a break right and uh here you go and then he comes back in and says oh I never said that I don't know what you're talking about yeah well we kind of got you on video doing it but uh n not a shocker all right hey let's  get into the notams I don't see uh I see a lot of stuff going on I do look like uh look like I see flashbang on the Move uh looks like he's going home here uh that starts here I think in two days uh and it goes until let me just click on it um April 5th to the 8th all right so that it goes all the way to that's kind of interesting to Monday the eclipse day hm all right well there you have it that is where we are this is all turbulence and slop headed across the drink and then uh I don't you know I'm not seeing anything  else we did have a a Chinese rocket that just broke up over California I don't know what happened to it but uh there was film of it coming in and breaking up across uh California high altitude as it reentered the atmosphere but uh didn't see any boxes for that maybe that was a short live thing so okay Cyber attack we get over to Bit Defender at the threat map at you can see we are being lit up like a Christmas tree today um yeah this is uh we're getting we're actually getting pounded today so uh if you're having some weird  fluky stuff happening that's probably why all right okay bigs Army Airfield as we get into the Deets on what's going on at our at our military installations I'm just looking for big things moving in and out um that right there is American Airlines showing up uh from Philadelphia uh looks like a um 787 n uh 900 Dreamliner that's interesting brand making new National cargo showing up from Homestead Florida two very unusual locations we don't see those coming in from that spot to bigs ever all right so  I don't know what's going on behind that my guess I'm just going to float this out here National cargo out a out a homestead down in Florida yeah it's probably got a bunch of Haitians on that plane I'm just putting that out there my guess and then it looks like from there uh this National cargo is going to fly over to Jackson Mississippi and then this one looks like got a Delta Airlines in there too that is also going to Jackson Mississippi all right so I don't know that I mean maybe some troops but  I'm I'm really thinking immigrants all right all right again you see American Airlines Delta Airlines that will uptick all right because uh Swift air isn't going to have they won't be in business running operations so okay do the big thing here just big 747s and then just notice where they're headed R Ze Poland all right so again moving moving big big pieces troops I like I said I think uh that's your for operating base uh in uh Poland just right off the border of Ukraine all right then this Keta coming in from CBG  747 that's all I see are very widebody large aircraft coming in and out of do headed over to uh Europe all right okay this is Ramstein again look at this camber flight going to Kuwait from there uh don't see it inbound I see some smaller 737 800 from Kuwait uh that that's that's got a military uh no bad Aviation uh actually that's not military that one is C130 uh that's probably if I had to guess taken some uh probably taken some of the Crim to LM out of uh that's been uh pulled out of Gaza sent to Kuwait we put them  on airplanes they go to Ramstein and then we either send them back to the United States via Charter or via uh commercial flight and then look at this one you got a 747 coming that's a camber flight out of Kuwait City so um all right well let's watch it Middle East seems to be really really up ticking right now okay this is going to be rze Poland again this is this is Ukraine right here this is the forward most forward operating base from the United States um in in the region of course it is a commercial Aviation um uh airport  as well but you can see all the military coming in German air force the Brits um let me go down we got camber flight look at that 747 747 those two we just saw leaving or departing go down a little further let me see how many others we have uh Duke that's going to be a base commander Atlas Air coming in from Hong Kong actually sorry leaving to Hong Kong from there German air force pretty active folks pretty active that's the Brits right there all military um everything I pointed out now check this  out NATO to plan a long-term Ukraine Aid they mole 100 billion Euro fund watch for the United States to re wicker money instead of having it air marked for for Ukraine Aid uh they will probably pump it into NATO which NATO will then launder it and send it to Ukraine which then it will get laundered again and um but that's their plan uh I got to tell you certainly feels like war is in the air okay now speaking of that that's the ruskis right there Russia has almost completely rebuilt its military this is  coming from a Us official yeah so so while all of us are looking at delayed lead times for manufacturing equipment uh not going to make it in time two years out for uh Stinger missiles Etc Russia has managed to completely get their uh military back up to the level they need in order to go to war so it is almost completely rebuilt that's incredible all right well listen there's a reason why I'm just going to point this out why why Russia is still in the Bible when you get to Ezekiel 38 Gog Magog Russia  Iran turkey three of the primaries there is a reason they are in there and we are not when you see that news I just showed you that their their military is 100% back up ready to roll okay um and then you hear about us and uh we're we're our spr is at uh the uh 17-day level um you know we don't have uh our Navy ships we can't get them made and pushed out fast enough because we're having uh material shortages and worker shortages and everything else uh that's the riding on the wall folks telling you it's coming  and we are our days are numbered okay here we go this is going to be the Brits uh just notice they're coming out of the United States headed back to the UK and then this one looks to be coming out of uh Nova Scotia and Marsailles so Mara is uh that's out of France that's that one right here all right moving on camber flights holy smokes what uh what we got 10 10 10 camber flights and look where they're all going that's Middle East these two are in Europe and these probably are pretty much one in the same all headed  same directions but uh uh look at this look at the amount of flights in the air uh very active across Europe very active here uh headed down to uh the Middle East and then it looks like we got some uh popping in and out of Ford hood um that one's going to be Alliance uh in Fort Worth and then this one uh looks to be East Coast all right okay Omni same thing right headed uh out of the um out of the us over to Shannon that's that's going to be troop related then this one coming from okona to Seattle that could  be a troop rotation Maybe and then looks like another one rolling out of Anchorage down to uh that looks towards okona let me just double check that yakota Seattle Baltimore Anchorage to kadina yeah it's okona all right okay now let's talk here this is uh this is going to be Doha all right um if you're if you're not familiar let me back up the location so you can kind of see exactly where this is a sorry I said Doha this is not Doha Doha is over here this is jaib boti all right uh so we're just going to take a gander at jaib boti  and see what we got uh uh this is a lot of commercial flights is what I see I don't see any military that one right there looks uh that's Atlas Air 767 out of Kuwait all right so we do have some troops that have been moved down to this location out of this location so here down to here all right on the board and I'm just going to see I that's it so other than that jaib boti is clean but it looks like uh that is going to be uh the latest movements all right now check this out I think Iraq is getting  ready to start Staffing up because of Syria because Russia Iran turkey very heavy presence inside Syria given the state of what's going on around there I would imagine um this you think about this military seal of command or or MSC uh basically uh the ship loaded equipment Bound for Iraq and uh says that um a privately owned us Flagship under long-term Charter to the MSC is currently using three shipboard cranes to load 550 pieces of caro cargo consisting mostly of 20 foot sea containers all right uh interesting so  it looks like we are using thirdparty stuff to move um move our equipment maybe it's because the fact that we have several of them stuck in the Port of Baltimore now I think four of them this is what we read so it doesn't end there though check it out us could revoke the hooti terrorist label if the group halts attacks on ships this is absolutely the the dumbest thing I've ever heard in my life um that we would actually go to this terrorist organization and say listen um if you will stop attacking our ships  going into the Red Sea will take off your terrorist label and um this is right up there along the lines of uh listen we'll pass this bill if you'll stop Flying the Gay Pride Flags over all of our embassies around the world um yeah how much you going to pass uh 7.2 billion or trillion sorry $ 7.2 trillion dollar spending bill um if you'll stop Flying the flag over the embassies absolutely crazy and people take the bait and they go oh yeah let's do it sounds good all right this is Doha all right if you're  not familiar with that that's this comes in and out of bahin it's in that general area the longest ever Runway you can imagine uh you could land space shuttles on this Runway they're just absolutely so long um and uh anyway uh looks like got an atlas there in and out that's cool wait now what I am seeing are a lot more military flights than we normally see in and out of Doha I haven't seen this in a while uh moose 77 that's going to probably be a c17 C130 Atlas Air coming in from Kuwait and then of course  that going back to Kuwait 747 that's probably moving equipment uh around from up north or moving it up north okay they came in maybe to the port there or something okay there you have it and a camber flight coming in from Frankfurt again that's Doha all right El Gora okay this the the only Point behind this one is just to show you that the flights are existing they are coming down this is a day ago and um you can see landed down here towards the South um if you kind of get into it this is the Red Sea right here all right Egypt  over here Israel right here West Bank right there Jordan here Saudi Arabia here so they kind of bring them right down to this little pinpoint out of el Gora all right let's talk these mil inel balloons because if you don't think they're up there I track about 45 46 of them now to date um this is the one that left near cydney Ohio ventured out off the east coast and dropped down this is where we lost track of it but it's out here um last check it was about 65,000 ft well above commercial commercial  Aviation but uh definitely something to keep your eye on uh that's one and then this one 682 just getting Airborne that uh looked like it took off out of Hurley s uh sorry South Dakota and it's currently in root and uh the tail number on that thing is n251 th and um yeah you can see it's sitting at 64,500 FT that's a shadow by the way it's right here moving I think about 15 knots 15 miles per hour sorry 6435 mil hour just keep an eye on it if you're in this neck of the woods you got a balloon over your head all right all  right listen that is going to do it for our sitre today I hope you guys have a fantastic rest of your day and weekend um if you're over on patreon don't forget we've got two things we're coming at you here over the weekend uh we'll talk more about uh some under the radar stuff things we didn't get a chance to cover in our

M26	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p26dUrf9Zso	Brit's foreign secretary David Cameron says that you should vote through funding for Ukraine what do you say to that I think he tried to compare us to Hitler also and if that's the kind of language he wants to use I really have nothing to say to him well he likened you to an appeaser to Hitler in not voting through funding for Ukraine are you an appeaser for Putin I I think that um I really don't care what David Cameron has to say I think that's rude name calling um and I don't appreciate that type of language and David Cameron  needs to worry about his own country and frankly he can kiss my ass but do you think Putin's the good guy in all this 	Center			Liberal	138
M44	https://youtu.be/5DPNo97OkDY?si=Pr71M6CIpSvtCVkI	I'm ready when you are all right um I grew up in a really tiny town in white s in Washington um it's got a population of probably like 1,200 people if it hasn't gone up since I left um I was raised by a single mom and have two older brothers and um once I was about 20 years old I started thinking about joining the military um I left for Fort Sill in 2013 and did my basic training there and it was awesome I loved every part of it and then uh AIT I trained to be an Intel analyst and then I spent eight years  doing that in Colorado and um once I got out then I went to Hawaii to spend some time with my dad um he's getting hospice care and my brother's also over there and his new baby um um so that's kind of an overview but um to fill some gaps uh our mom was a very sick individual uh very um combative really aggressive a lot of anger problems uh and then in her 40s she was diagnosed with um like dementia early dementia and so that made more sense but um basically my childhood was like drastically different than my brothers  uh they're five and six years older than me all three of us have different dads and my oldest brother and I um we had no relationship with our biological fathers uh I was about 9 years old when I decided to try to find mine in a phone book and call him up and I was able to get a hold of him and um throughout my childhood because of what my mom had put us through I had this fantasy that my biological father would find out that I existed when I was nine and then maybe come and rescue me from that um and then  I met him and he was a total uh he made me feel really stupid um he was like commenting on my eye color and I'm like nine so I don't know anything about anything and he said that um my eyes were Hazel and I said uh I think they're like kind of a greenish color and he was like yeah that's like Hazel and that's all that sticks out from my relationship or interaction with him um and the reason why I was so fixated on finding him and being rescued by him is because uh being that I was much younger than my  brothers and um my mom herself had grown up in like foster care cuz her mom had her when she was 15 and then uh she was raised by her grandma for a little bit and then her grandma passed away when my mom was 16 and then she decided to run away then she ended up in juvie for that and then eventually she found a good foster mom who ended up being like a grandma to me and my brothers and being really good to us we went to Christmas at her house every year um and got the full like Grandma experience she's a great cook  and like so loving um super Christian so that kind of changed like my perception of different things growing up um but to get a little bit deeper into some of my mom's issues with me uh I feel as though even though I I'll never know because she didn't talk to me about it um I feel like something pretty terrible must have been happening to her when she was a kid in going through foster care maybe or in juvie or out on the streets and it seems like it took such a toll that instead of her viewing me as like her daughter and her  child it seems like she saw me as like a reflection of herself and just kind of like poured all that shame and hatred into me um and that looked a lot like deliberately leaving me with people who were going to do bad things to me um some of like the earliest memories that I have are sorry it's okay take your time do you look like your mom no not at all I'm glad but uh um some of my earliest memories of some of the things that happened to me with a lot of people throughout my childhood was um like smells and feelings and  sights of like blood like not full memories right but there will be like little things that trigger like a little bit of a like a shred of a memory but um as I got older it became a lot more clear to me like what I was going to be expected to do with these people and as I became more aware of it I would push back because there's certain people um certain like uh I don't know how to describe them like pedophiles um that are good at making it seem like a treat they're good at like giving money or candy or food or clothes or toys and  like making you excited to be there and then shifting it and then some people are just like like awful right off the get-go um and it led to a lot of confusion of like why am I being left here like because my understanding is like they're babysitters or they're friends of mom or like there's she trusts me with these people and uh sorry let me just collect my thoughts so as I got older and more aware and more experienced with certain people because I'd see the same people again and again and um as I got older that was  an indicator to me that she was like this was a choice that she was making to take me to these people um so as that realization started to set in as I got older and this is before I met my dad so between like birth and nine um I would push back a little bit more I'd threaten to run away say I don't want to go I don't want to like don't leave me here I don't want to stay here and each time that would happen I'd be stuck in my room and she'd like literally nail the Windows shut and then lock my door and uh and leave me like  for a long time like not long in like the grand scope of things but like a day or two as a kid just being locked in a box like no bathroom or anything like that that uh [Applause] it really uh changed I think what I could have been growing up and um so yeah that really fed into this desire for somebody to come and scoop me up and take me away from it that being said though as clear as I made it that I hated certain things certain ones weren't that bad right so that's where it kind of goes from like  um like I don't want to do this into shame because it started to feel like with certain people it wasn't being done to me it was something I was doing and I was so afraid that people were going to find out and uh I didn't it's like so hard to explain like a child's uh like mindset about things like this because as a kid like I wasn't thinking like oh people are going to call me like a and think I'm promiscuous as a child I'm thinking I don't know what this is but it feels gross it feels wrong I know at least my friends like  don't want to be naked around other people and so like given that comparison um it just felt like I was like really up and being gross and it was my choice and uh that like over time once these things stopped uh that just kind of became like my understanding of how to interact with men um so around the age of 14 uh it was beginning to taper off and got my first period that year and my mom actually um purchased like cemetery plots at Lyle cemeteries it's like 20 minutes away from my hometown and she like walked me up into  the cemetery and showed me my plot and said like this is where you're going to be cuz you're done I'm done like she was I think she was trying to get across that like my my purpose my what I was meant to do for her I didn't have that job anymore because I'm not like right for it anymore I you're too old I exactly I felt like I was being like like fired like terminated basically this is rural Washington yeah very rural rural and that uh that really feeds into it too because in a town that small everyone  knows everyone perception is reality and my mom was perceived as this like beacon in the community um she had a daycare when I was a kid and then around the time that I went to middle school she finished up her master's degree in like sociology or something and she got a job with the Head Start in town the only Head Start in town as like the center coordinator so kind of like a principal and so like everyone in the community especially in our church just thought she was like the best thing ever  and I could never relate to that because she was like such a monster at home like she was psychotic like was doing this for money I don't know what it was for because we really struggled with money like I know I talk about her having a master's degree but like the way I describe my home growing up is it's literally a single wide trailer they took half of the trailer off and built onto it to turn it into a house so like we had like this like Shack of a house with a trailer hitch still attached did she have a drug problem no  not that I know of and then it was just last year in Hawaii with our dad who's getting hospice care because he's on like such heavy medications he had like he had substance abuse use issues so now he's got cancer and they're trying to treat pain and he's got such a like high threshold for pain medications and things like that so in that delirium he's admitted a few things that I didn't know about my mom like that they dealt cocaine before the boys were born that would have been in like the early to mid  80s but after that my experience with her growing up was like very Christian no drinking except maybe a glass of wine anytime I would cry as a kid she thought I was on drugs she'd accuse me of being on drugs if I was breaking down because she was being like crazy and throwing or slamming things and it was too much as soon as I'd start to break down she couldn't see it for like the reaction that it was but she treated it more like it's just coming out of the blue and like why are you why are you  acting so crazy you must be on something and like again I kind of like absorbed all of that and uh I got really heavy into drinking after I turned 14 but I never touched drugs because I was so afraid of any like weird Behavior I had being tied to that and uh it helped me though because when I did decide to enlist and go for like a TS clearance my back background check was pristine because I'd never been busted for anything or been on anything I was giving them honest answers in the interrogation  but um so between 14 and 16 um she was done with me and made it very clear she wanted me out but it's not the same as living in like a bigger city because you can't just like walk out on the street and find a stranger to crash with or whatever like I said like everyone knew me everyone knew my mom so when I did get out of the house I had to just like go back there and um so I started partying a lot when I was 14 that was like freshman year of high school I got my first boyfriend um and uh between 14 and 15 with him  especially everything that had kind of like Ed up when I was little started to like cause problems with that relationship because like teenagers are kind of thinking similarly like when they get into relationships right start thinking about like sex and things like that kissing everything and it was like so weird for me because I had such an aversion to him kissing me so we put that off for almost like the whole first year of our relationship we didn't kiss which I know seems ironic but then he  started to like want us to lose our virginities to each other and it like destroyed me because uh I wasn't thinking about it that way like by that age I'd come to terms with certain things I'd heard enough about the things that people were doing to know like more about like what I'd been partaking in when I was a kid and so for me like he's thinking we're going to lose our virginity to each other and I'm thinking like I lost it like when I was probably like four like and so and it just it made me hate him so  much he was so nice to me he was like the best high school boyfriend you could possibly have sorry it's so weird cuz I don't know you but you but um he would like take me out on nice dates and buy me things and uh he got his like license and he wanted to drive me everywhere and he was like he was like obsessed with me he was so good to me and I was so nasty to him because I like couldn't really I felt like I hated him so much and I couldn't make sense of it but I just started acting on it and uh and at these like parties that I was  going to when I was that age um I would just like Get Wrecked and then just like act like a like as soon as I was drunk I wanted to take my clothes off and I wanted people touching me and talking to me and taking me places like I wanted it I felt like that was like what I was supposed to do and um and like obviously he couldn't take that like he wanted to stay together too and he wanted to stay friends and everything and then I'd like give him a hug and it's trying to turn into more and I like couldn't handle that and uh  eventually we fully broke it off this is like before I even turned 16 and um shortly thereafter I had my 16th birthday drunk on like the floor of someone's trailer watching fireworks on TV and um it was about a week after that I went to another party in town at this place called The Grange hall it's like a barn basically where people have like bigger parties in town and so I went there to see um like friends of a friend who were playing in a band there and after they finished playing I went outside to see like what's happening  afterward and there was one guy who was like I think he was probably like 19 or 20 at the time and I'd seen him at a few different parties he and his girlfriend were like known to like kind of coordinate a lot of this stuff so I went up to him I was like what's going on tonight where's the party and he said oh yeah like we're going to go with my friend Jeremy we're going to drive up to Trout Lake there's going to be a ton of people there and so I got in the car with those two and his friend Jeremy and  we went up to Trout Lake which is an even smaller town that's like 20 minutes like up into the woods they have one gas station in like a little like corner store and we get to Jeremy's house and it's just this guy and his girlfriend and Jeremy and Jeremy on the way up there was talking about like he just got divorced so I'm thinking like he's like old as and so we get up there and we're like sitting around and kind of drinking and I'm just thinking as time goes on I'm like when is everyone going to get  here like there's like nobody here this is lame and so I told the guy the one that I knew I was like I'm just really tired I just want to sleep and then maybe you can like drive me back down the hill in the morning and that guy Jeremy was like here you can take my room I'll sleep on the couch and so I went and I passed out in his room and then hours after that I wake up to him like crawling into bed and reaching under my shirt and like I didn't I just went with it right and um but it felt like it just felt so awful because I'd had a  little break from that and like every interaction I'd had after that was like fully like my Pursuit and something that I thought like I was into and that felt like what I was used to which is like I'm just here and like you're going to do what you need to do and I need to just like like wait until it's over and then we're good and it's fine and so that happened but at night Corey and his girlfriend left and went back to their house so they left me alone in this guy at Jeremy's house and he didn't take me  home for like two days and like it just kind of like At first I felt like really like disgusted and like shut down because it took me back to that but shortly after that I started looking around and I'm like this is like somewhere that I can stay though and not go back to Mom and I hated my mom at that point and she hated me she was like so volatile all the time and like school was like a dumpster fire for me every year I'd like start strong and then I just quit turning in my work and sleeping in class  and dressing like and acting out and so by that time I had like given up on school and so I was thinking like I'm just going to drop out and I'm just going to stay here and so I did that and uh after some time had gone by with this guy Jeremy my brothers caught on to what was happening because like I said everyone knows everyone and people knew Jeremy and those same people knew my brothers and word got to my brothers that this like 30-year-old man was like in a relationship with me and I I had just turned  16 and my brothers at that point in my life it was so weird because like it felt we never really like bonded that well cuz there's such a huge age Gap and our experiences at home were so different and as soon as they could move out they did which was when I was like 11 and 12 and um so I wasn't like close with them in that way but when they heard about this they went and found Jeremy at work and they like cornered him and beat him up and I guess like well I don't want to say something like incriminating  but they like really him up and then he stopped talking to me for a couple days and I know this sounds weird right but like I couldn't handle it I couldn't handle being like left by him like after I like decided that that's where I wanted to be um I was just like so upset that I would have to like go back and so I would not leave him alone and basically we had this Arrangement where like he would come into my hometown and then have me like hide in the back seat of his car so he could take me back to  his house and things went like that for a little bit and then um my mom was aware of the situation after that too and told me that I like could not come home after that and uh so I stayed with Jeremy and then when I was 17 I got pregnant and um at the time I was trying so hard to act like him and like emulate that age and that like maturity level and like life experience and stuff I was like yeah I'm ready to start a family like this is what I want too and so I got pregnant and then we got engaged and we had a son  together and and um I really really tried to like fit that fit that mold and like be a good mom because like I knew that even at that age like I really wanted to be the complete opposite of her like I've spent probably my whole adult life trying to identify an opposition with my mom but um I just like I felt like I was suffocating because like once I had our son I looked at myself differently I felt like like more important because I'd made somebody I was in charge of somebody like and that made it like so  much harder to be around Jeremy or like act like a partner to him because I didn't see it that way anymore I felt like I was more like a possession to him or like someone just kind of coexisting with him and because like the attraction was starting to Wayne then he just wait until I fell asleep and do it then and so like I just after I think maybe like a year of that I couldn't do that anymore I got a job at Big Five Sporting Goods and I started to think like I can find a way out of this I can like work really hard and get my  own money and get out of this and it was actually while I was at big five I met my recruiter's wife and was training her there and she started to tell me about like the military and what it could do for my life like school being paid for and medical benefits and maybe even a signing bonus depending on what kind of job you get and if you get the Intel Analyst job you'll have a clearance to fall back on and this is like embarrassing to admit now with um kind of like the culture of everything but I really wanted to be a cop when I  was that age and so I'd gone on a few ride alongs and tried to get an idea of like what I would need to have to go and apply for a job like that and a lot of them had military experience but specifically they said don't be an MP be an Intel analyst because so many people fall off this job after like a year and you'll want like a clearance to fall back on to get your foot in the door for like high paying entry level jobs so that's uh when I started to kind of like think about starting over and like  making something out of my life and getting away from my hometown and getting away from Jeremy but unfortunately what ended up happening is as I was approaching my ship date for basic training he like preemptively filed for divorce and I was like not to make excuses but I was a dumbass kid and I asked somebody else to read the court paperwork for me and be like what am I about to sign can you explain to me like what this says what is this and they said like oh it's like nothing is going to change everything's going to stay the  same it's there's no changes you're just going to be divorced and I was like yeah that's exactly what I want and it turns out that I was like agreeing to not have custody of our child anymore and also agreeing that I owed him back child support for months and I signed it like happily willingly signed that and uh right before I shipped out it's finalized I get my paperwork I give it to my recruiter so that he can start figuring out like how many dependents do I have what kind of pay am I going to  get when I'm at basic training and I'm thinking like hell yeah like I'm going to get BAH because I have my son as a dependent I'm going to put a bunch of money away I'm going to come out with a fat savings account for us and we can start fresh instead I showed up to basic training owing back child support and then something that a lot of people don't realize is it takes a minute for your pay to catch up in basic training and so i' had only earned like one month worth of pay before it was Christmas block leave and our drill  sergeants had told us like um you can stay here for Christmas block leave and just clean and get smoked the whole time like have to do like push-ups basically or you can buy yourself a ticket and fly back home and go have Christmas and like who's that lucky who gets to do that in the midst of basic training and so I was thinking like I don't have for money right now but like I'm going to use this paycheck to fly back home and like see our son and spend time with my brother and um and I had a car leas at  the time and I've like never told anybody this cuz I'm like embarrassed about it but basically I didn't have money to make that payment I skipped the car payment and bought a plane ticket instead so I could go back home so what ended up happening is my car was taken away right um and then with the back child support like my credit was destroyed and so I graduated AIT and luckily a lot of people got like interim clearances in AIT because their investigations were still going but like my clearance came through licky split  because there was nothing to it and so instead of having an interim clearance I had a full-on like TS clearance when I graduated which was blessing because my credit got ruined at the same time and that's a huge part of maintaining your clearance is having like good finances good credit so that people can't use like your financial instability as leverage over you I think that's basically what they're worried about um and so once I had my job I was just like riddled with anxiety that I was going to  lose it in any time because you lose your clearance over like this all the time I had to take people to go and like get flagged for having up finances so I had that hanging over my head and then the custody of course and in the midst of that as sloppy and stressful as everything was while I was at AIT I met my second husband and he was my age like couple years older than me like the most like physically fit like normal looking guy guy probably in our class and so when he started giving me attention at AIT I was thinking like one  I didn't think I had it like this and two like this will really be my new life like I'll have a spouse that's my age that I'm really happy with and really attracted to and then like we can be together and that can make it even easier for me to get my son back but um once I graduated and moved to Colorado with my second husband he was crazy too which it took me a long time to realize that you kind of repeat those patterns throughout your life until you deal with it um again just really volatile serious anger  issues and then like a ton of cheating through out like right off the bat and uh when I had to go back home after AIT to get my things and moved on to Colorado and in that time I met up with my like childhood best friend and uh I told her a little bit about like what it already happens and she was like you need to get this anold like this is not a good guy this is up like you need to get out of this and then just like come back home and I was like that's not an option anymore like I have to go to Colorado I have to be married  I'm not going to leave this person this is my chance like no matter how like up and crazy he's thing I really wanted my life to look better and like different and have a chance to turn this around I still felt like I could undo the damage that had been done but it just got like too much to handle like we're calling the cops on each other like he would break and hurt me and I would call the cops and then he'd go and call the cops to make it look like he hadn't done anything and it was such a mess there too um that  like just a couple years after that I flew back home for a little bit and stayed with Gabby again and um in that time though I went back home and I was like starting from scratch or trying to and uh I I got like all of my military moved up to Washington I got like everything done that I needed to have done and then I even started working like side jobs and stuff and then I was borrowing this couple from Church's car until I could buy my own and over time though I'm like so shitty about communication or I was that I was  like blowing Gabby off and not talking to her when I was having worse days and then Ryan was reaching out my husband and I wanted to like I really wanted to make that work I wanted to go back to that and I had hope that maybe maybe like if he got like anger management or something like he said he did maybe it would be like totally different if I just gave it another shot and like as I'm blowing Gabby off she's being hurt by that because she worked so hard to get me set up there and take care of me and give me a soft place to  land and then I just wasn't even talking to her um and so she got pissed and she texted me while I was at work one day and she was like um these people my my friends from church they want car back if you don't give it back today they're going to report it stolen and um and I no longer had a place to stay because I was also like rooming with another couple from church who had like a renovated garage or whatever so in one day in one Fell Swoop no car no place to stay and like Ryan in my ear so for me it was like such a  clear choice I was I have to just go back there at least there I have my own apartment with my husband we have a car I have a life there I'm like somebody there I'm not just this like free floating thing back home surrounded by all my peers who are like flourishing in their lives right now and that was like the added thing I know that seems Petty but it like it just felt awful to work that hard to change things and then be surrounded by all these people that didn't have to work that hard and their  lives are taking off and yours is tanking and uh so I made the choice to return to Colorado and it was about a year after I came back to Colorado that uh Ryan and I had our son together um and I have him he is the light of my life I felt a lot more ready for him and able to take on mothering um in the midst of all this instability though I really came to terms with the fact that like if I were to read enter my first son's life that would be such a detriment to him because as gross as Jeremy had to be to be a  30-year-old man pursuing a 16-year-old child he had like remarried already and to somebody his age and our son was like settled into life with them and calling that lady mom at that point and I started to feel like I wasn't ready for that I don't know that I could ever like move far enough away from my experience with his dad to not have that effect how I treated him or raised him I knew how my mom treated me based on things that she'd experienced or things that I'd feel like she probably experienced and I made the decision over  time that I'm not going to pursue that I'm hoping that he'll do what I did when I was a kid and he'll wonder about me and want to be rescued and maybe like find me and reach out to me because he still lives so close to my brother who still lives there and that like I I feel like it would just be so easy for him to find me if he wanted to I feel like I want to leave it his choice to like try to search for me rather than like try to like infiltrate his life in that way because there's just so much that would  come along with that so much explanation like you know as he gets older I'm sure he can factor in the age difference and understand what that means but at the age that he is now which um he's like still a kid for sure but uh I think that it would just be like so damaging and so disorienting to a child at that age like he's going to be coming up on like puberty soon and things like that and I feel like that would just decimate a kid at that age to like have their their absentee mom like reenter the picture  and explain why they left in the first place and have to Grapple with the idea that like their dad played into that somehow the person who is raising them so my choice now is to leave it and uh raise my other son and um uh while I was in the military um it got like like trickier and trickier to balance things out with my second son's dad my second husband and um eventually I mean I would have to so we're dual military or we were he had the same job as me obviously we went to AIT together and uh but he  worked at division so he was like a desk jockey and then I worked in first brigade so I was actually doing like field training pretty often um because we're supposed to be like the first to deploy if something happens so I was in the field constantly and uh in that time he was very clearly like not honoring our relationship and it just making it like obvious to me um and a big part of that that like really uh wasn't something that I was like willing to deal with anymore as the thought that like our kid was in the  house when he was like having different people around and uh so our son wasn't even a year old when we divorced or we split up and then we filed for divorce but that court case got dropped so many times CU I wasn't around to even go to the first hearing the initial status conference um and a couple years after we divorced is when I shipped to Afghanistan for my first and only deployment um and I was very very excited about that I didn't want to leave our son but I was so excited for the chance to have that experience  because it's like kind of a rarity these days for like regular military people to deploy like SF is a totally different ball game but like just regular like combat support Moss's that you don't really expect to like get to deploy unless you're staying in for like 20 years and so the fact that I had that opportunity was so exciting to me and again thinking about all the money I'd saved not paying rent not paying a car payment and just stacking like combat pay on top of that and it was also really nice and really  fulfilling for me because I trained so hard on that job and then I finally actually got to use those skills in like real life scenarios so again I felt like very purposeful very important and like motivated about my future but um about halfway through uh I was working coops so that's current operations ENT op open source intelligence analysis um ISR so uh that's Intel surveillance and reconnaissance uh basically you tell like the drones where to go and what to look for and they give you like counts  of like Personnel at different compounds and things like that so we can decide if we're going to send anything that way right um so in the mix of all that right as fighting season was ramping up in the summertime we heard over like the speakers on the fob um like the base uh that somebody was shooting at the base and so everyone's freaking out and thinking it's like very very serious right because we get reporting all the time that I'm looking at myself saying like these are people that were targeting this the place that we're  targeting in the time and everything so I'm looking at reports that back this up as a possibility and uh once I heard that over the speaker and everyone's talking about it in the jock so the joint Operation Center um it was my job to kind of brief everyone on what was happening and then help make a decision about what qrf was going to do about it now um I had like two sets of orders for this deployment and one was from NATO and that was advise and assist so what people imagined we were doing in Afghanistan  like training their own military and police then I had a second set of orders from 4id which basically said that it was going to possibly be more of an offensive Mission with some like support for like Parliament elections but um basically uh when this person was shooting at the base we called in the Afghan police to deal with it first but they didn't want to approach the persons this person stand stand in like really tall grass right outside the fob near like the vehicle entry point I think and  um it was hard to make out like what they looked like or what their age might be or anything like that but the Afghan police wouldn't even approach this person they're standing like a field away and won't come any closer and this person's just like unloading rounds at the fob with a pistol granted but um he duck down into the grass when he noticed the Afghan police were in the area and when he came back up we had such like uh blurry footage from the drones basically that when he stood back up everyone around me was so  convinced he had a beard right that's what we look for too to determine is this someone who's like a like military AED male right and so I was like I'm thinking like yes let's like put this to a stop let's end this like qrf is on the way they'll deal with it do what you need to do and um so they arrived right on the other side of the fence and they got their 50 cal ready we waited and then they shot the guy down and it was like completely excessive right it's a 50 cal for like a human being that's not  that far away I don't know if you've ever seen a 50 cal firing but it's like insane and um and then after that all happened and the guy was clearly like dead in the field um I I had to like keep eyes on this person right so I'm like watching the footage of this person like convulsing on the ground eventually they stop and he was left there for like the whole day and as time is going by and we're using like different tools to get footage of this we looked at the Peds footage and it turned out that this was  like a little boy who had ducked into the grass when he saw the police coming and he tried to kill himself he shot himself like in the mouth but it didn't kill him so when he stood back up he was very disoriented and had blood like running down his cheek and chin and neck and it looked like a beard with like really poor footage but once we looked at the Peds footage which is what I used to get clearer images to build a story board which is basically like images from start to end and explanations  analysis and any reporting that might go along with it and like I said like I even I had reporting talking about hakani Network patrolling that specific Village that was in that area and I had to explain that um once once we did find out that it was a child once some people had come to like gather the body later in the day um um then I had to explain that hakani networks been going to these Villages it's a normal thing for them to like give weapons to kids and send them outside of the fob because it will set  off this type of chain of events and it's easy to like build propaganda off of that and say like hey look they're just like killing the kids in the village for no good reason like don't trust them don't talk to them because that's what we count on right we count on people all around the fob in these villages to give us like reporting about threats and things coming down the line right so that's like a great way to get people to not want to talk to you if they think you're a monster that just kills kids for no reason and so it  worked out exactly the way that I think that they wanted it to um but once that happened and I had to like watch that whole thing play out realize that it was a kid and then use images of this dead kid just laying out and stiffening in the sun while nobody's coming to collect his body and that's uh that's like that's the hardest part for me is that like nobody was coming to collect him up and um I don't like it felt different if it had been a man I was like it like he's doing some bad like whatever he can lay out  there and then I found out that he was like 12 years old and I was like like where are his parents why didn't they come and get him he's like turning yellow and like when they they put him in the back of a truck to take him away and they just like picked him up and like tossed him down in the back of the truck and drove off and I could just see his like stiff body like rattling in the back of the truck and I couldn't believe it because I was like it just like like that's a kid like and I think that I had spent enough  time in a different kind of life and far away from my mom and not talking to her to be so far away from my experience of like feeling and I know there's no comparison right but I felt like so far away from being a kid that wasn't like cared about I felt like that could have happened to me when I was a kid and nobody would have really noticed that's how I felt when I was a child and that got kind of reactivated when I watched this um happened with this kid in Afghanistan and so that being said I  came back home from that I felt so differently and uh so like careless like I felt like very indifferent like I didn't give a about my job anymore and I didn't like the people I was around and I just didn't see the point of any of it and you've like you can't be that way and like do your job in the military right and um and then I started having like sleep issues and panic attacks and like anger issues and uh finally I took myself to behavioral health and I found a psychiatrist there and just started  telling him like I don't I can't function like I want to be dead so bad I want to be gone so bad like it's so uncomfortable to just exist because you know I worked so hard to get away from one thing and then it's on to the next thing I work so hard to get away from that thing and fix it and then it's on to the next thing and then I and then I'm like back through the with my second husband and I've got to work hard and get through that and then deployment again it felt like a huge opportunity and something that was  really going to like 180 things for me but um it just seemed to dig me deeper and deeper and keep pushing me back so um so I started talking to the psychiatrist and uh he explained to me he's like you we can manage this we can get you on medications you can do this or you can be medically discharged because you have PTSD they will discharge you for that and so I just took him up on that and uh I was like let me let me get the out of here because I can't do this anymore as badly as I wanted this as badly as I wanted to  like complete a career and like do good and be worth something and make all this money um I just like I couldn't do it and I didn't care anymore and uh it started to become like really hard to like find a way to put anything into my son right cuz I was just like you know he's a child I love him so much I would never do anything bad to my son right but like it was it that you know mothering should come fairly naturally right and I felt like I had to like force myself to take care of him and like that was making me hate myself even  more because uh I was like this isn't coming that naturally and and it's like so much work to just give him the bare minimum and he deserves so much more than that and uh so once I got out um was crazy as I was getting out Co hit and uh it was actually I was at a voluntary 30-day inpatient program called stron hope in Utah it's an excellent program um but while I was there and getting a lot of help from my problems and getting on anti-depressants and everything um we started seeing like news on the TV in  our little like Clinic area talking about this new virus from you know and uh and everyone's freaking out and thinking like what is this should we take it seriously and lo and behold I get back from this 30-day program and like all hell is breaking loose there's like the quarantines and everything like m panic and like everyone misunderstanding what's going on and having no trust and businesses shutting down and my plan had been like okay I I'm going to tackle these like mental issues that I'm having right now and  then I'm going to go back to school I'm going to finish school there's still a chance right and uh I get enrolled in school and with covid happening all the classes changed to like an online format and I was going to a community college at the time and their online format was garbage it was so hard and so I ended up just giving up on that and uh just kind of like coasting along for a little bit until um until uh my second husband he had been in Korea for like a little over a year and he was anticipating coming back to the  states he was supposed to finish out his contract there get out of the military and come back to Colorado to help me co-parent so we could do 50/50 and he met a woman over there and they got serious very quickly and he decided to move to California with her instead of coming back to Colorado and when that happened I was like I don't know what the I'm doing here like I want to go I want to go back to Washington or somewhere and I knew that my oldest brother was on the big island in Hawaii we spent some time  there when I was little and so I reached out to him and he had just had a baby he was telling me that our dad was over there getting hospice care and I decided that like I just wanted to be close to like the little bit of family that I like felt good about and wanted to be close to I wanted my son to like get that experience too cuz he'd never met any of my family um and it was there that like kind of uh the type of person that I had tried so hard to be in my adult life I stopped caring about it and I wanted to do  something easy and so with Co with you know everything else that's happening right now and only fans being such a huge thing I decided to get into that a little bit for easy money somehow I had like I mean not like a lot of people following me on social media and stuff but enough that like immediately I was raking in like so much money doing that and uh I started to feel like you know I don't really give a like what this looks like to anybody anymore I just want to like make my money and like and  just enjoy my life for once I was in Hawaii and making easy money I had like I had to spend 10 minutes a day to make like 30 Grand in a month you know like it was a no-brainer for me for a long time but um I also like started to feel kind of burned out on just doing the same all the time and having to talk to these people cuz that's another part of that you don't get to just like post pictures and videos you need to like respond to people and send out more for them to pay for and I just didn't want to  keep talking to these people because they've got all these expectations and uh and I was just I don't I don't care about those people you know like I was like just look at me that's it and then give me your money and that's all I want like but um one person that was uh subscribed to my only fans found after he found my only fans he found my Instagram and uh he messaged me a few times saying like I'm on the big island too can I like take you out to coffee can I take you to dinner whatever and I'm thinking like this another person  that thinks I'm going to be like a prostitute and they can meet up for a dat and then like pay and have me for like the whole night or whatever and I don't want to deal with that and so I put it off and put it off and then eventually he like started saying some like genuinely nice things to me like hey like it seems like you're not having a very good day are you doing okay or like I'd post something about like how I was feeling or whatever and you be like really nice and supportive about it so eventually I was just like yeah like  let's go get coffee at like my favorite place and in my mind I'm thinking like this guy's going to be weird as hell but I'm going to have my coffee and dip but um he ended up being great and that's my boyfriend now um and he's got like an awesome job in Virginia and so my son and I after a while of course um but not long enough by most people's standards uh we ended up moving with him to Virginia he had to leave and it was um kind of this decision of like if he leaves and we stay then that's it and I  felt like he was so different than like anything I'd experienced before um even though it's like not the most kosher way to meet somebody like it felt so like good and so like not necessarily safe but very comfortable right away and that was something that I like was not used to experiencing my life like feeling care and support and like consideration about things that were important to me and like he took a little bit of my background information and it seemed like he took it upon himself to kind of  like help me figure myself out and get better and um and so that's where we're at now we're in Virginia and I'm like much happier much more stable um I'm sure I'm still going to need years of therapy like effective therapy to really work through this stuff but I'm like feeling more optimistic about my future and more sure of it than I have in a very long time because finally I feel like all these things that I've really struggled with and been hurt by have like turned into tools for me an experience that I can look back on to  like level myself out because when so many like intense things have happened you start to feel feel like there's just it's always going to happen you're always on like high alert for the next that's going to fall apart as good as everything might look and that's obviously taken a toll on us a few times but another thing that stuck out to me is like he's so like gentle about it and understanding about like why I'm acting the way I'm acting and he like really wants to learn about like why certain things that would be so  normal other people like really affect me and send me spiraling and it's like it's so cool to have someone like passionate about learning about another person so um and like my son is doing amazing uh his dad's parents live like 20 minutes away from us so now he gets to see his like really wholesome put together grandparents all the time it's obviously had like such a great influence on it and um it seems like things might really turn around for us now and I feel like so driven now um and I just feel like  it's I feel like it's important for like someone who's in the midst of a lot of that might be similar to what I've felt I feel like it's important for them to see that that's not the end state that pit is not the end State and like healing is not linear and like character development is not linear you can be like a great person for months and be a person the next Second and that also doesn't have to be the end state so as like cheesy as it may seem like I just I feel like it's important for people to see that you can no matter  what the circumstances are of course I don't know what everyone's been through but like you can dig yourself out of it if you want it badly enough if you want to be you have to want to be a good person not just like be success UC F and Achieve what you want but like I really want to be like a good person and and you know as badly as you want it sometimes you can be like really up still and so it's like um yeah I just I feel like that's that's pretty much it that's one hell of a story was a lot you've been through so  much it's nice to see you getting some good luck finally yeah yeah I feel very very lucky and plus um my boyfriend's mom has like she like has me call her umy uh they're Pakistani and so that means like Mom and so like she texts me all the time to see how I'm doing and we have like dinners at her house and like when when it was Eid she like dressed me up and like it it it's feels wildly uncomfortable in the moment with things like that that are like so foreign but um after the fact like it's pretty amazing to like  have a chance at that um and so yeah I'm like very fortunate and very thankful I know not everyone is going to like luck out the way that I have but yeah it's worked out for us for sure it's great all right thank you so much Victoria thank you thank you very much 	Center			Center	139
M78	https://youtu.be/Qvl6vwyezLw?si=ABrpAq_edOsESf3z	ya dábamos un breve avance de lo que fue el debate presidencial el primero de anoche excelcior lo titula entre propuestas y ataques primer encuentro de los tres presidenciables la jornada fuego cruzado entre candidatas ofrecen escasas propuestas El Universal cruzan acusaciones de corrupción en debate Claudia shb candidata de morena enfatiza supuestos negocios turbios del Cártel inmobiliario sochil Gálvez de la alianza opositora hizo referencias al colegio repsamen y a la línea 12 del metro Jorge  Alvarez maes en repetidas ocas señaló a ambas candidatas como parte de la vieja política en Milenio golpes bromas y fallas del reloj se imponen en el primero de tres rounds en la línea sochil Gálvez a quien le agradezco mucho que me tome la comunicación cómo estás ochil Buenos días a Susana buenos días Qué gusto saludarte a ti y a todo el auditorio Gracias ochil ya una vez pues pasadas algunas horas con la adrenalina controlada con los nervios también cómo evalúas tu participación en el debate de  anoche mira lo que sí fue un hecho fue el cambio de formato sin que nos avisaran eh Se supone que iba a haber una pregunta y luego venían una bolsa de 5 minutos libre donde nosotros íbamos a poder plantear las propuestas y su ataques contraataques tú administraban de 5 minutos no estaba previsto que los moderadores te hicieran preguntas entonces pues tiene razón ahí uno de los encabezados que dijiste que faltaron propuestas el tema es que nunca hubo un espacio ni siquiera para presentar y ni siquiera para plantear el tema por  ejemplo en el tema de salud Pues a lo mejor 2 minutos para plantear el tema de salud y educación Cuál eran tus propuestas y luego entrar al debate eso impidió pues que la gente pudiera conocer completa las propuestas y por eso pues cada uno nos comíamos un poco del tiempo de la pregunta para medio subir cosas como lo que subí respondía la pregunta y te quedaba poquito tiempo para la propuesta y ese fue un cambio que al que no les avisaron so no les avisó avisar no no nos avisaron ustedes van a interponer algún tipo de recurso  por esto o qué van a hacer yo yo yo yo creo que lo que hubiera valido la pena Es que nos avisaran para entonces poder replantear tu formato Yo me sorprendí y obviamente yo lleva un orden mental de cómo hacer las cosas soy como muy ingeniera no y ya tenía prácticamente mi mente que que iba a decir en el primer minuto en el segundo minuto en el tercer minuto iba a administrar mi bolsa lo traté de hacer de una manera pues creo que en el primer bloque Pues fue la que le quedó tiempo este los demás pues se  fueron con la finta y Perdieron su tiempo pero a mí Lo importante es en este país una mujer que es responsable de alguna manera de 52 muertes Se presenta como candidata a la República sin rendir cuentas lavándose las manos evadiendo la realidad no hay duda con el documento que subí el día de ayer a mis redes que en el 2016 Claudia le negó el programa de protección civil al colegio repsamen por escrito y no clausuró el colegio o sea ese colegio se vol a quedar otro año sin protección civil en el 2017 meten otra vez el  documento y la pregunta es por qué no lo clausuró si tenía riesgos de todo tipo si no tenía programa de protección civil y dos no hay duda que en el metro la causa de la caída del metro fue el mantenimiento Ese es el reporte de una empresa y ella evade ataques juego eh eh lucrar con la tragedia imagínate se le cae el metro se le cae el repsamen se le cae el segundo eh del del interurbano el elevado aú se le caería el país aún con todos estos señalamientos que hiciste sobre el repsamen sobre la línea 12  sobre la casa gris sobre la corrupción la ivermectin etcétera no lograste noquear la sochit Pues porque ella iba eso ella iba ahora en el Pos debate los ciudadanos tendrán que analizar estaban ahí conmigo cuatro de las víctimas una una víctima de repsamen una de la línea 12 una del cáncer o sea todavía asegurando que hay medicamentos eh de una insensibilidad por eso pues ahí me salió el Mote de dama de hielo ni siquiera sin muta ni le preocupa ni le importa ni le duele lo que le pasa a las mujeres por ejemplo cuando  Denise le pide que pregunte que le conteste el tema de mujeres di ya ese ya le dediqué mucho tiempo no O sea eh para ella estas causas y la mentira más grande que yo invito al público es el famoso portal digital no existe no tiene información es pura paja leyó sus 20 premios no hay manera de saber sus contratos abiertos y el caso de corrupción de deuro pesa trabajaba en grupo indi cuando recibió millonarios contratos de su gobierno de la Ciudad de México se fue a trabajar al tren Maya y luego se vino ella lo nombró  subsecretario de obras para supervisar las obras que le asignó cuando era contratista en grupo indie eso eso es terrible lo escuchamos anoche eh sochil cuál era tu objetivo en el debate es decir hacer propuestas noquear a Claudia shown desenmascarar a tus opositores cuál era tu objetivo en realidad y dime si crees que lo lograste Pues mira hay dos objetivos el círculo rojo que solamente quiere una cosa y el círculo verde que quiere otra cosa al final de cuentas yo creo que en redes gano el debate pero por mucho en todas las  encuestas en todas yo gané el debate en los intelectuales pues ellos hubieran querido ver un debate de puras propuestas Pero eso hubiera hecho que se apagara la tele y no había manera porque el formato no lo permitía no lo permitía ni siquiera o sea había había preguntas un tanto eh Pues un poco ambiguas algunas demasiado extensas que en un minuto es muy difícil contestar entonces sí siento que ese formato fue diseñado para beneficiar a shen porque ella le convenía un debate acartonado nos debería de dar la chance de poder  cuestionarnos entre nosotros y exigirle que conteste ahora participaron todos los partidos en acordar el el formato no lo que dices es que al final hubo una sorpresa un cambio sin avisar Así es al final al final esta bolsa de 5 minutos no se respetó para beneficiar a Shan y Shan bown dice que te beneficiaban a ti con el reloj porque qué desastre del reloj también y de la producción muchas fallas Pero mira ahí está la Shan bown que conocemos la culpa seguramente va a ser de Calderón de lo del reloj no O sea  siempre le echa la culpa a otro o sea yo qué tengo que ver con el reloj O sea yo yo yo ni tengo eh V en el entierro y creo que ahí las consejeras la consejera tade la consejera hf se disculparon con ustedes por estos errores sochit No nad nadie Se disculpó y a mí también me cambiaban el rel de una manera tremenda o sea fue a todos no no fue solo a ella fue fue fue a todos no mencionar al presidente Andrés Manuel López Obrador que muchos apostaban que iba a ser el protagonista del debate no mencionarlo prácticamente  fue una estrategia tuya así lo decidiste Mira finalmente era un debate Entre ella y yo yo yo sí esperaba tenerla eh Y no era un debate con el presidente y pues ella se ex culpó todo el tiempo y se escondió detrás del presidente por eso le tuve que decir que pues ni que no es amo que ni tiene su liderazgo ni ni mucho menos Su carisma o sea realmente el tema era Pues que ella contestara por ejemplo algo que no contestó y no dijo sí o no Yo le dije di sí o no tu familia tiene negocios en los Panama papers O  sea no dijo No tú decidiste que ese debate iba a ser con ella y no mencion a López Obrador por estrategia Pues yo quería tener un debate con ella o sea porque pues finalmente era ella la que tenía enfrente no iba a hablarle del presidente Pero obviamente seguramente en el tema de seguridad pues va a ser imposible no hablar de los resultados del presidente ahora otra cosa déjame me voy al final esto de la bandera fue a propósito fue un error que luego quisieron Es que qué pasó seguramente la gran mayoría de la gente que nos está  escuchando y viendo vio el debate Pero al final das un mensaje colocas la bandera de México al revés y esto se leyó como un error que le habías puesto de cabeza y luego después en un tweet tú dices que así está México por eso la pusiste de cabeza puo primero de cabeza y luego vertical y ya no lo puse vertical porque se acabó el tiempo Ah bien Esa era la idea y no terminaste no terminé porque el tiempo se me cerró la verdad de las cosas entonces este abrazar y luego y ponerla de pie pero pues ya ahí fue cuando me  sonó el rojo te sientes satisfecha tienes algo de frustración cómo te sientes Sí sí siento un poco de frustración eh con el formato o sea es un formato Que obviamente beneficia la zona de Confort de Claudia shena o sea y además pues el que Denis no le dijera Pues a ver Contéstale a sochil si sí o no este tienes que ver con los Panama papers o contesta Yo yo al menos sí le contesté que mi casa Es legal o sea sientes que hubo más cuestionamientos hacia ti cont no sino nadie la cuestionó ella de que no contestara nada O sea no  pudo contestar que le dio a los capitalinos un medicamento para piojos eso fue realidad fue realidad ella se dice científica y hizo experimento con las personas de la Ciudad de México como si fueran animales de laboratorio eso es bien grave Denis y se dice científica y y y y aunque lo niegue lo de invermectina fue un escándalo científico a nivel mundial y este reciente estudio que le dije la ciudad que peor manejó la pandemia es la ciudad de México en la Ciudad de México perdimos 9 años de esperanza de vida 9 años en el país 4.5  años imagínate el desastre del manejo de la pandemia en la Ciudad de México y ella presumiendo sus premios ve el estudio reciente que acaban de sacar los científicos mexicanos donde al menos 240,000 personas pudieron haberse evitado que murieran en la Ciudad de México pero pues no pasó nada no pasó nada sochil ahí tú se lo dij dijiste no respondía la estrategia era muy clara no Claudia sh mantenerse tú tratar de moverla y Álvarez maes que lo conocieran eso es lo que dicen los expertos Que supongo que ya te pasaron algún reporte  a ti anoche de las mesas de análisis en donde Pues dicen que perdiste una oportunidad sochil que se esperaba más de ti que no pudiste ganar el debate etcétera Supongo que ya escuchaste algo pues sí escuché eso pero realmente que me digan los expertos cómo lo logras con ese formato de debate mm O sea que te digan cómo logras posicionar tus ideas contra atacar contraatacar Si tú no eres dueña de tu reloj si el dueño de tu reloj es el moderador pues así ha pasado en todos los debates hay un reloj una  cuenta de mucho más libres en el 2018 creo que fue un ejercicio más fluido No más fluido aquí era muy poco tiempo muchos temas temas muy importantes sí se veía muy complicado entenderlo y seguirle la narrativa pero Bueno pues eh No se logró posicionar ninguna idea Yo creo que en el Pos debate estamos logrando posicionar las cosas en el Pos debate estamos logrando posicionar que Claudia no contesta eh Y yo lo que quiero decirte es solo en México una mujer que es responsable de 26 personas muertas en un evento y otras 26 en otra  Hoy está de candidata a la presidencia con la absoluta impunidad de que ni siquiera se haya investigado su directora eh del metro ni siquiera fue llamada y ella como alcaldesa siempre se lavó las manos diciendo que no era responsable de la caída del colegio repsamen sí efectivamente no se construyó durante su gestión pero sí podía haber clausurado ese colegio porque el inba había iniciado procedimientos Pero alguien que no le sabe pues se lo cuenta pero yo soy fui delegada yo sí le entiendo a Cómo se  debe de resolver un tema de una clausura y las delegaciones el único tema que teníamos En ese entonces para clausurar una obra era por protección civil sí no hizo uso porque no le importó porque no gobernó y se murieron 26 personas teó de verdad te costó mucho trabajo sochil mantenerte lejos deslindar de los partidos políticos es tu flanco más vulnerable porque ahí se concentró también mucho Claudia Shan bound Pues mira es que ellos están llenos de existas llenos de expan istas y se atreven a decir el pri o sea ellos son  resultado de la suma del PRD del pan del Pri o sea tienen personajes impresentables como ble a a al que era de segalmex este y y escupen no Entonces cuando me tratan a mí de endosar yo qué culpa tengo que este gobierno no investigue los actos de corrupción si tú le pudieras decir a sochil Gálvez en el cuarto de guerra en qué falló y en qué tiene que mejorar como candidata en el próximo debate qué le dirías cre que Pues a lo mejor no pelar a los moderadores y llevar yo mi debate no este y decir Bueno pues si te  hacen preguntas no contestarlas y decir lo que tú quieres decir a lo mejor esa debía haber sido mi estrategia Quizá no para para poder eh ejecutar el debate pero de todas maneras pues no había un mecanismo para que se obligara a Claudia a contestar y además dijo una cantidad de mentiras pero una cantidad de mentiras o sea habla de que tiene el mejor sistema de salud o sea qué cinismo de de mentir O sea si algo le ha aprendido al presidente es a mentir o sea da datos que son absolutamente falsos como el de la aldea digital Yo te  invito que haas el ejercicio Métete ahorita y Trata de ver los contratos por adjudicación directa invitación de restringida O sea no encuentras absolutamente nada pura paja Bueno pues ochi le vamos a Ojalá que se mejore el formato del siguiente debate entiendo que también ya lo amarraron ya hay moderadora y moderador Pero supongo que a partir de esta experiencia tendrán que reunirse otra vez a reevaluar no y que nos digan si sí vamos a tener al menos imagínate no hubo ni siquiera la posibilidad de presentarte en el debate  ni siquiera Sí sí sí Exacto sí Exacto o sea soy fulana de tal Esta es mi visión no O sea Cómo Entras a un debate sin ni siquiera plantear lo que está en juego en el país Cuáles son tus puntos de vista y en cada tema eh Pues cómo ves la salud Cómo ves la educación Qué está pasando con la corrupción Yo no digo que nos dieran 20 minutos 2 minutos dirías que tu falta de contundencia déjame ponerlo así fue por el formato del debate por las fallas en el formato totalmente o sea había que contestar la  pregunta en lugar de entrar a los temas que yo había preparado pues suerte dejé varios en la mesa suerte en el segundo debate so chili Muchas gracias por est por esta conversación gracias Buenos días Eh so chil Gálvez candidata de la coalición fuerza y corazón por México ahora regresamos con más del debate presidencial

M102	https://youtu.be/Khn1qOfUeyY?feature=shared	the rumors persist was the president actually born in the US and if he wasn't what does that say about president Chester Allen Arthur who did you think I was talking about our 21st president Chester Allen Arthur is remembered as much for his outlandish facial hair as he is for his outlandish facial hair it's it's really awful I would have been cutting those off in his sleep yeah no it's a little much but when Arthur became president in 1881 The Whispers surrounding him were about more than his whiskers Democrats claimed that Arthur a  republican wasn't born in Vermont as he maintained but in Canada which according to the Constitution made him ineligible for the Oval Office the charge was ever proven but even today there are those who say it's true so this is the birthplace of Chester A Arthur 1829 Heather Dar says that Arthur was born in this modest house in the town of Bedford in frenchspeaking Canada just 15 miles north of the US border it's not often that a presidential birth place comes up for sale I know I think Americans could come  up here and own a piece of Americana very easily and you are fairly convinced that he was born here yeah I am actually I really do believe that Chester A Arthur was America's first Canadian president okay this is basically the research room just down the road in the village of stanbridge East darch and Judy antel oversee the Region's archives if we're investigating the question of where Chester Arthur was actually born this is a good place to come this would be the place to come yes this much we know Chester's Father  William Arthur was an itinerant Minister and teacher who traveled back and forth across the very poorest border and when his son the future president was born this was a Schoolhouse right where Chester Allen Arthur's father was teaching in 1829 right exactly the year that he was born right right here in Canada exactly our records indicate that this house has always been known as the White House ironic yeah very what's more the family of Chester's mother Malvina was living nearby in Canada at the time  of his birth Melina we know already had children so she would have needed someone to look after the children while she was uh nursing a new baby so very likely that she went to her mother for help and assistance so yes it's very likely that Chester was born here and then there's this Chester Allen Arthur lied about the year of his birth till the day he died and he refused to answer questions raised by the birthers of his time if he was born in the states why was it such a big cover up why didn't things just come  out into the open why is it still an issue right now and why is it still a mystery not surprisingly 30 Mi South in Fairfield Vermont the locals at Chester's Bakery stand by their namesake as made in America now the people over in Quebec that we've spoken to the Canadians say that they know that he was born over there Fairfield people know that he was born here we have a pamphlet right in the window said born in Fairfield well they've got pamphlets in Canada they must have lied granted the pamphlets are in French  so I couldn't so you couldn't read it right ours are in English and it says born here in Fairfield we travel down Chester Arthur Road to the Chester Arthur Historic Site which used to be called the birthplace to investigate do you think there's at least a chance that he was born in Canada no well yes there is a chance but I doubt it John dumville is in charge of Vermont's historic sites is it possible that Chester Allen Arthur was born in Kenya no come on fairfield's town clerk Amanda Forbes showed us this record  indicating that Chester's father Father William was elected to a local school board months before his son's birth in 1829 this is sort of As Good As It Gets In terms of evidence right we don't have any concrete birth certificate I wish we did but we don't the truth may be lost to time and to the fact that Chester Allen Arthur burned all of his papers right before he died what would the average Canadian say if he or she found out that Chester Arthur was actually Canadian I think they you first have to  tell them who he was he was they probably don't have any idea and then they might be pretty thrilled I think they be pleased 	Leaning Liberal			Conservative	142
M108	https://youtu.be/NBh7So-c3As?si=Q-aXAjrbhZDIExIU	it's baffling how common it is for people to live stream their most embarrassing moments on purpose they're filming their own low lights Their Own Worst ofs for the Montage of Shame things most people would want buried forever they are proudly with a smile on their face broadcasting to Their audience for content today an extremely trashy stream clip has gone viral with a streamer named Alisa Jordana firing up a live stream after learning that her boyfriend has been cheating on her I'm going to go through most of what happens  in the Stream but the clip everyone's seen which we'll get to towards the end is at the very end of the stream it's about 2 hours and 20 minutes she gets her boyfriend in the car and then she starts attacking him while she's driving so she starts physically hitting him and then she hits him very hard in the nose like a full-blown strike to the nose like a Monk's Palm strike to his nose it was quite a wallup like if she was playing that boxing bag game that you see at bars where it measures your  punch and it like grades your Force up to 9999 she probably would have scored like a 700 with that strike so it definitely could have caused some damage she threatens to kill him and then she continues to escalate it she grabs on his ear and starts pulling on it and then he starts fighting back so he starts fighting her he starts yanking on her hair telling her to stop the car and she does stop the car he continues yanking and pulling on her she gets out of the car he gets out of the car chases  her down and then he gets back in the car and turns the stream off without a doubt one of the worst live streams I can think of in recent memory it's hard to watch it's awful it's it's crimes like you're you you're watching crimes unfold he lied so much to me he lied so much to me and he lied and he told her like he told her I'm just like a streamer and I'm just an investment and like the whole time he was talking to me he was talking to her the whole time Gad zuk what in the would possibly possess you to want to start a live  stream after learning something so heavy that makes no sense how poisoned must your brain be to possibly come up with an idea like this learning that your boyfriend has been cheating on you and then immediately turning it into a stream for Content that's incomprehensible I don't understand why people want to broadcast every single waking moment of their lives to a bunch of strangers online a ton of goobers who are just going to sit back tossing popcorn down their G it because it's just entertainment to them even though  it's your life that's being ruined in real time why do that Jack Bower couldn't torture me enough to force me to go live after learning something like this he could put all the jumper cables he wants on my nipples and scrotum I still wouldn't do it because it's it's a horrible thing to want to put out there I couldn't even imagine just firing up the stream hey guys this one's going to be a little bit different than usual turns out she's getting piped by another man right now they's steaming hand ham  as we speak oh thanks for the $6 Charlie's girl is slobbering on my meat ha haa and sending her money on venmo yeah but why are you surprised I'm not surprised Brandon I'm not surprised actually I'll go to Tanger Outlets right here I just don't get why you would cry over him dude like you already got money you already supposedly got money from him I did but he still was very bad Brandon yeah so what do you think would happen if you're going to marry him this and that I'm not marrying him Brandon  I'm obviously not Maring him yeah but I'm saying if you she then goes for this joy ride or black there of joy and it's the most distracted driving I've ever seen no exaggeration she doesn't even pretend to be paying attention to the road she is glued to her phone or reading the chat I believe cuz she does get donations she has text to speech enabled so she is getting donations throughout this stream and she is always looking at something other than the road that is extremely dangerous not only to  herself but all of the people on the road around her and you can see that she busts out that crazy uturn and gets honked at because that came out of nowhere like a jump scare to all the other drivers like this is just it's unhinged this is again unacceptable it's illegal you can't be driving like this I understand she's upset after finding out her partner's been unfaithful anyone in the world would feel the same way but not many people in the world would handle it the way she is by starting up a live stream for people to be  tuned in on with everything not only is she very dangerously behaving here on the road but then she then starts just dropping all kinds of personal information publicly just publicly revealing a lot of things that 100% should stay private why is adanel I'm going to go to Tanger Outlet actually with his card right now all right let's do that Tanger Outlet let's let's go in a shopping spring hope you find your way home 48 jsk not that much money left should I spend this money sparrows for everyone another Lord dump for you  for why she drove to the mall here it's because she had his wallet and and stated she wanted to go on a bit of a shopping spree with his cards and then on stream she actually opens his wallet and shows his driver's license and says should I should I drop his cards in the Discord so threatening to also just show his cards to her community she then takes money out of his wallet and says should I buy food for everyone those are all crimes again you're you're compiling evidence against yourself you're doing the police's job  for them you are actually showcasing criminal activity now unless I miss something she doesn't actually spend any of his money she doesn't actually use any of his cards there she just makes the threats that she could and would do so she does however actually open his wallet and you can see his driver's license clearly cuz she's bouncing it around like something out of the Disney Channel so you can see that but I don't think you can make out any of his other cards but regardless this whole thing  should have never been put online I don't know why she made the decision to start streaming this again she does have text to speech donations enabled so it's possible that this is all just to get some like money from people that are sympathizing with her because she's she's going through something horrible getting cheated on sucks but the way she's handling it is awful she's distracted driving dangerously putting other people's lives at risk on the road threatening to commit some criminal actions live and then it ends with her  assaulting him physically assaulting him live like this is a horrible streams and he thought oh discord's stupid a lot of people say that right so um all of scor's private information as as long uh Sarah's phone number Sarah's address her full name her VMO account transactions J donated $5 is your Mexican girl hot it sounds as though Alisa has fully doxed the guy and the girl here posting all of their private information in her Discord which is illegal you can't do that I also think it's worth mentioning since you  caught a glimpse of it there anytime that girl Sarah is brought up during this stream both Alisa and the community of pay Piggies that's donating to her always make sure to mention that she's Mexican and they make statements in the chat about that as well throughout the stream reading the chat there were so many moments of genuine racism it was sickening FYI February I called Sarah I'm want kill you kill sorry sorry sorry you had hit him in my presence okay I'm I'm not going to talk about the bad uh  topic I talk about it no I I said I'm going to stop talking about it okay good no it's not okay you've ever been cheated on for two years with a 20-year-old Mexican I doubt it getting into my bus okay well I'm just telling you that's my business I really don't want to talk to you this happened shortly before the viral clip from this stream where she starts hitting him in the car so prior to them getting in the V she pushed him outside and it was actually observed by someone who confronted her about it because in this  instance her violent Outburst was in broad daylight in view of public and bystandard so someone came up to her I believe it was an officer and talk to her about it and even during this talk Alisa still finds a way to mention that the other girl is Mexican hello hi hi Sarah how are you how are you Sarah I got hi can you thanks so much for calling I'm just going to send to you like six months of texts of uh your nudes and you know different sentences that he Sarah I'm sorry about this don't talk don't  talk idiot uh yes Sarah we're really sorry about this and sending him your way today uh yeah yeah yeah so so baram baram how do you pronounce it you know I don't know shut the up what's up she's half she's half your delete the number pleas I cut out the ending here because it it it's a lot like even this much I don't even know if YouTube will allow me to show I'm really not sure it's legitimate assault so she hits him a couple of times the nose hit by far being the biggest blow and then after where I cut it off he grabs her  hair and starts yanking and pulling on her and she starts talking about how he's killing her and the car stops and then eventually she gets out of the car he chases her down I think she gets in another vehicle in the background and then he comes back back into the car and turns the stream off it's it's a horrifying thing to watch to be honest as of right now Alisa has been arrested her mug shot and booking information is all out there for this incident there's no update on the guy or what's going on  with that part of all of this but what a awful live stream now on Twitter there's been a lot of debate about this video on whether or not the man's actions were justified in this situation and most people are saying that they were claiming that he was acting in self-defense and it seems like the law would agree with them on that take because from everything I can find he hasn't been booked or charged with anything now I think it's important we remember that the guy in this video is no saint he cheated on a significant  other that is the behavior of a piece of but under no circumstances does anyone deserve to be beaten like this he's not a good guy but he is still the victim of an assault and I think all of the video evidence suggests that this was a case of self-defense he didn't lash out at or strike at her until she went in again for like the third or fourth time assaulting him and then he did fight back now I do think there is a case to be made that he may have taken it too far because he does yank and pull  on her for quite some time even once the car comes to a complete stop so I think he probably could have gotten out of the car at that point and just left it entirely left the situation entirely but I also don't know the entire situation on where it was stopped if it may have been dangerous to do so I don't know but overall I do agree that this does seem to be him defending himself like from getting attacked in this vehicle overall this was a awful live stream and I really don't think this is going to be  the last of its kind that we see because it feels like it's getting more and more common with people wanting to live stream every moment of their lives even the worst parts of it so there'll probably be more things like this in the future which sucks that's I I think it's just an awful Direction but just wanted to talk about this that's about it see y 	Leaning Liberal			Center	143
M115	https://youtu.be/JOk4qVx_FN8?si=4YI4hFP2ByPQAyiA	Iran's First Direct attack on Israel was full of Sound and Fury by Israel's count 150 ballistic and cruise missiles bringing the Middle East to the moment of Maximum danger many predicted though Iran insists this was not intended to start a war the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem is perhaps the most hotly disputed territory on Earth and last night the sky above it was [Music] two this was the moment operation true promise was launched by Iran's revolutionary guard these generals settling a very personal Vendetta after  seven of their colleagues were killed in an Israeli air strike in the first wave were some 140 kamikazi drones they're known as flying lawnmowers because of their noise but by daylight it was clear the damage was minimal Israel's air defenses intercepted most of the weapons though a seven-year-old girl was injured this missile landed in a Northern Iraqi V Village British and American war planes shot many of them down though from Israel no talk of Victory the campaign is not over yet we need to remain prepared and attentive at  the same time we blocked the first wave and we did it with great success this was a dangerous and unnecessary escalation which I've condemned in the strongest terms I can confirm that our planes did shoot down a number of Iranian attack drones I don't want to pay tribute to the bravery and professionalism of our pilots flying into the face of danger to protect civilians early this morning prime minister Netanyahu spoke to President Biden who reportedly urged him from the White House to accept that Israel had  won adding that the US would not participate in a Counterattack but it took 6 months before Mr Biden criticized Israel's leader over the ruinous war in Gaza and who knows if America can head off a wider War now some Iranians celebrated after being told by their media that the operation was a great success with 50% of missiles hitting Israeli military targets one revolutionary guard Commander talked ominously about more such attacks if provoked by Israel though the official line remains we had to respond and we  told you we would we announced to the White House in a message this morning that our operations will be limited and minimal the aim is our legitimate defense and the punishment of the Israeli regime from our point of view this operation is over and there is no intention of continuing it but if the Zionist regime takes any action against the Islamic Republic our next operation will be much larger Israel may have made a serious mistake with this unacknowledged air strike in Damascus a fortnight ago in thinking  that Iran would not dare retaliate directly but Iran's mistake may be even bigger the next slap will be harder reads this anti-israeli Banner in Teran though Iranian weakness was exposed last night so Israel's war cabinet has been weighing up whether to deliver a crushing blow to the only Nations still prepared to fight them though talk of a regional Coalition seems farfetched for now in the face of the Iranian threat we will build a regional Coalition and exact the price from Iran in a way and  at a time that is right for us faced with our enemy desire to hurt us we will continue to unite and become stronger this afternoon President Biden spoke with his fellow G7 leaders hoping diplomacy would head off further escalation Israel seems emboldened by its military success and by the help given by America Britain and even its Arab Neighbors in Jordan where this missile was shot down the risk now is that those Partners find themselves drawn in further by whatever Israel does next so this moment  of Maximum danger has not yet passed well joining me live from Tel Aviv is leftenant Colonel Peter Lerner who's a spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces thanks very much for joining us I mean an attack like this some form of retaliation was surely inevitable after the air strike against the Consulate in Damascus uh good evening Jackie thank you for having me I think what's more important is how we see what a group of likeminded decent Nations that come together in the name of defense and in and despite the Diabolical intentions of  Iran we prove together that we can defend lives and save lives and that is precisely what we did with over 300 um explosive drones uh cruise missiles ballistic missiles that were fired at Israel over the course of the night but the attack itself was retaliation it was expected it was well telegraphed wasn't it Israel has not been had conf confrontation with Iran since the 1st of April Israel and as we've seen throughout the course of the last 6 months but also for many years Iran is the source of everything bad in this  region they are the destabilizer of everything they have empowered um Hamas they have um financed they have trained they have equipped healah they have instructed the hooes to conduct attacks on the maritime cargo uh routes so everything that is happening in this region is to do with Iran they have been up until now behind the scenes um and yesterday they came to the front of the stage and I think what the Coalition proved in the course of the defense of Israel is that their aggression their hostility their attacks cannot be um  will will not be successful and will not be tolerated well well I hopefully we'll get to come onto that Coalition in a moment but Iran has said this was in retaliation for the airri on the consulate they said it was always going to be a limited operation there is no intention of continuing it now so can this end here um and at the same time in the early hours of this morning Iran's proxy Hezbollah launched more rocket attacks against Israel so I don't trust Iran I I don't see why anybody should they are  the source of everything bad in this region so what is your assessment of what happens next then what is your assessment of what happens next the IDF has presented a a spectrum of options um to the government the government as you you rightly pointed out in the report um are currently con convened And discussing those options um once they come out they will give their instructions to the IDF and we will act accordingly I don't think it's appropriate for me to delve into the specific details of course there is a  price for action and a price for inaction so so so is there is no question of no retaliation from Israel I don't know we'll have to wait and see what the government decides after some weeks of tension between Israel and your key Ally um the Americans um you know the attack has seen President Biden come and reaffirm what he says is his Ironclad commitment to Israel but he's also reported to have said the US won't get involved in any any military campaign against Iran they don't want you to do anything more do  they they want this to stop here to not escalate this situation which would be very damaging for a very wide region potentially we have to also ask ourselves that if we don't do anything and if Iran can be allowed to get away with launching this most extensive missile rocket and drone attack against Israel um and if they think that this is the new Norm of the relationship um what price would it be will we wake up again once more to a reality of the 7th of October that instead of ham terrorists it will be Iranian uh activist Fighters  Warriors in our houses so I think there's a a strong case for action but they're also absolutely I would agree with the the concerns of of of the Safety and Security of the region we live here we are it is at the top of our concern but we're not willing to live under the cons persistent threat that the Iranian regime um is conducting against us either directly or through it very briefly on the issue of Coalition which you raised know British planes were involved we heard the Prime Minister talking about British planes  shooting down some of the drones I mean how would you assess the risk in countries like Britain being involved in this again I think that there is more ample reason for being involved in a coalition against a tyranny uh regime like Iran the way that they've conducted themselves how they are conducting their aggression against Israel but not only against Israel you know Iran and the ircj g are hostile across the world they are conducting malicious activities against civilians against people around  the world so it's the right thing and that's why I precisely said a group of decent nations came together to defend against Israel not only from Europe and not only America also from the region because it everybody understands that that's the reality Peter larner liutenant colon Peter Lerner got to leave it there but thank you very much for talking to us good evening Jackie now Israel and Iran have been on a collision course since Hamas attacked Israel on October the 7th with Iran's proxies attacking Israel from Lebanon  Syria and Yemen the tensions between the two countries have been growing for years with Benjamin Netanyahu warning that Iran's nuclear facilities pose an existential threat to Israel our International editor Lindsay Hilson looks at how we got here the coffins of the seven revolutionary guard officers killed in Damascus were paraded through the streets of tan on April the 5th it was Al's day Iran's official day of hatred for Israel and its Ally America the leadership of the Islamic Republic said that this time it would  retaliate directly rather than via one of its proxy forces heralding a new stage in a two decades long Shadow War tension between Iran and Israel has been growing since 2005 when Iran's then president Mahmud ahmeda Jad made a series of remarks predicting the collapse of the Jewish State while building up Iran's nuclear program in 2006 Israel invaded Lebanon to fight Iran's proxy hisbah and since 2010 Iranian nuclear scientists have been killed and nuclear facilities attacked reportedly by Israel  in 2011 Israel seized one of several ships taking Iranian weapons to Hamas in Gaza in 2012 hisbah operatives blew up a busload of Israeli tourists in Bulgaria and since 2013 several Iranian revolutionary guard officers have been assassinated in Syria again reportedly by Israel a red line should be drawn right here the Israeli Prime Minister opposed all negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program he railed against the deal that was eventually agreed and celebrated when President Trump reneged on the  agreement in 2018 fast forward to a military graduation ceremony in tan 6 months agoe the supreme leader denied that Iran was behind hamas's October the 7th attack on Israel but praise those who carried it out we are proud of them he said Hamas leaders held meetings with Iranian officials who declared an axis of resistance to Israel hisbah Rockets are fired into Israel from Lebanon daily although the hisbah leader has suggested that they don't want a fullscale war Israeli forces fire at hisb trying to push them  back further from the border the houthis in Yemen also backed by Iran have attacked ships in the Gulf of Aiden prompting the US and the UK to send warships to the region this is a battle against the Iranian axis Iranian axis of Terror which is now threatening to close the maritime straight of Babel mandb without admitting it Israel has been stepping up assassinations of Iranian Revolution AR guard commanders in Syria and Iraq Iranian leaders have been getting increasingly agitated we have said many times that we  will not initiate War but if anyone bullies us then Iran will respond firmly at the 45th anniversary of the Islamic revolution in February Iran showed off its rocket systems and drones on the streets of Teran now they have used the in Anger risking both retaliation from the far better armed Israel and a wider War across the Middle East well earlier I spoke to Sayad Muhammad Mandi a professor at the University of Tran who was previously an adviser to Iran's nuclear negotiations team I began by asking how the events of  the last 24 hours are being viewed there the Iranians sent uh a lot of cheap and old missiles uh to uh uh Force the Israeli regime to use its anti-missile system so they spent maybe a couple of million dollars the Iranians and the Israelis spent $1.3 billion dollar and then the real Iranian missiles went by because the decoys did their job and those missiles hit their target so Iran got what it wanted was this a strike to send a message externally about your capability but internally to say yes  we've retaliated and it's done now was that the point of this the point was to change the equation and that is what Iran has done until now Iran has shown strategic patience the Israeli regime with Western support has murdered Iranians in the past and Iran didn't respond directly especially in the last few months because it wanted the focus to remain on the ongoing genocide in Gaza isn't that exactly what this has done it has shifted the focus away from what's happening in Gaza and isn't one of the biggest consequences of last  night's attack helping Israel pull back waning support from Key allies especially the US they're now talking once again about Ironclad commitment to Israeli security well let's not fool ourselves the United States in the west have always had Ironclad support for this genocidal regime this genocidal is owned by the United States in the west they are going to be remembered in history for this uh unprecedented genocide that we're seeing unfold in front of our eyes the reality is that the Israeli regime struck an  Iranian Embassy in Syria they murdered Iranians and the UK the US and France and the UN Security Council refused to condemn the Israeli regime in other words the UK government supported this attack by preventing the Israeli regime from being condemned so Iran had no option but to uh defend its sovereignty and to respond to the Israeli regime aggression but it has taken away Focus From the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and you have countries like the US UK and France who are being very vocal about the humanitarian crisis  um and criticizing Israel for not doing enough last night joining Israel's efforts to repel IR Iranian strikes let's be serious the UK the United States the West they are part of this genocide they have helped to create this uh this situation they have helped to create starvation in Gaza where do you think you are left now the Iran is left now in terms of what it does next you know the foreign minister was saying this is done now this is the you know we always said it would be a limited operation we hear other voices coming  out of Iran saying you know there may be more to be done here the Iranians have not used their Advanced missiles they have not used their Advanced drones they've been using old equipment they and the Iranians have a huge uh stock of drones and missiles so if the Israeli regime wants to continue Iran will have the excuse to hit it harder and harder and harder and that is exactly why the Americans want this to stop if the Americans thought that the Israelis could win they would give them the green light we know there is huge  danger there is huge danger in escalating this isn't there and there is huge danger in in that for the Iranians too and for the Iranian people well there's huge danger for the people of Britain and the United States because if this war spreads have no doubt that all American bases in the Persian Gulf region will be destroyed and that those countries that host American bases will be guilty by association and all those oil and gas in installations will be destroyed by drones and missiles so the smart thing  to do is for the UK government the US government and the others to reign in their Mad Dog and to stop murdering children Sayad Muhammad Mandi thank you very much for talking to us today thank you well Iran's retaliatory strikes of false President Biden to reiterate his Rock Solid support for Israel which had been seriously strained by the rising death toll in Gaza and with G7 leaders warning that Iran risks provoking an uncontrollable Regional escalation he's under pressure to stop a wider War Kieran moodley has more from  Washington the world is waking up to a new inflection point in the war in the Middle East Joe Biden's foreign policy pitch was that he'd restore calm after the chaos of Donald Trump this wasn't what he had planned President Biden is also Under Pressure to reign in the Israeli prime minister the president was in sconed in the situation room last night in constant contact with the Israelis with the Americans helping to bring down Iranian drones and missiles a success but also a failure of Washington's attempt at containing this  conflict after October the 7th part of that is down to Biden's relationship with Benjamin Netanyahu it was shortly after the Hamas attack that Biden warned Israel to not make the same mistakes the US did after 9/11 while we sought Justice and God Justice we also made mistakes yet Netanyahu has embraced American weapons but not words with tensions Rising as Washington criticizes Israel's conduct in Gaza the pair spoke last night and Biden reportedly told the prime minister to take the win and not  retaliate but will Netanyahu listen Netanyahu has for years and years and years wanted to hit the Iranians so to an extent this is the opportunity he's always wanted but at the same time it just so happens to take place with the war in Gaza underway and with Israel's International reputation Rock Bottom so ultimately I think Israel will probably be pressured into not responding immediately Biden spoke with the G7 today to push for a diplomatic resolution at a time when America's role in the Middle East has been questioned  the unified response to defend Israel was a welcome sign of Western power as Biden oversaw events in the Holy Land Donald Trump was preaching to the converted in Pennsylvania may God Bless the people of Israel former president used his favored line that all this was a failure of policy unimaginable when he was in the White House the weakness that we've shown Republican house Speaker Mike Johnson has said there will be a vote this week on more funding for Israel that had been held up in the house because it was  attached to funding for Ukraine something some Republicans oppose years now we cannot possibly support Ukraine and Israel and our own defense needs in the way that these guys demand so I think we should focus I think Israel is a much closer Ally with all eyes on what Israel decides to do next it could prove decisive to America's role in the region and decisive too in who wins the White House so President Biden is being pulled in two different directions here domestically on the one hand he's trying  to shore up his Democratic base so he's urging restraint from Israel and calling for the ceasefire in Gaza on the other hand Republicans are saying he needs to retaliate against Iran and that's why they want military funding for Israel but not to Ukraine they see Iran as a threat not Russia yet interestingly of course president zelinski said that the Iranian drones that were used last night against Israel they're the same drones that are used by Russia against Ukraine ultimately whatever Biden does between  now and November it will constantly constantly be scrutinized here at home regardless of whether it calms matters abroad

M151	https://youtu.be/XflM-LKXOW4?si=EzO2AMERDBQXBRZw	And finally, New Rule. If we want to save our country, we should follow the advice good liberals have given for decades and learn from other countries. -(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING) -Especially those beacons of progressivism like Canada, England, and Scandinavia, and I agree we should, as long as we're honest about the lessons we're learning. (CLEARS THROAT) And as long as we're up to date on the current data. Such as, the unemployment rate in the US is 3.8 percent. And in Canada, it's 6.1. And of the 15 North American cities  with the worst air pollution, 14 are in Canada. I'm not citing these stats because I have it out for Canada. I love Canada, and its people, and always have, but I hate zombie lies. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) -Zombie lies. (CLEARS THROAT) -(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING) That's when things change but what people say about them doesn't. Yes, for decades, places like Vancouver, and Amsterdam, and Stockholm seemed idyllic, because everything was free and all the energy we needed was produced by riding a bike to your job at the windmill.  -(AUDIENCE LAUGHING) -(GILLIAN TETT CHUCKLING) Canada was where all the treasured goals of liberalism worked perfectly. It was like NPR come to life... -(AUDIENCE LAUGHING) -(CLEARS THROAT) ...but with poutine. -(AUDIENCE LAUGHING) -Can-- Canada was the Statue of Liberty with a low-maintenance haircut and cross-country skis. A giant idealized blue state with single-payer health care, gun control, and abortion on polite demand. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) Canada was where every woke White college kid, wearing pajama pants outdoors... -(AUDIENCE LAUGHING) -...who'd had it up to here  with America's racist patriarchy, dreamt of living someday. (CHUCKLES) I mean, besides Gaza. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING) There's only one problem with thinking everything's better in Canada. It's not. Not anymore anyway. Last year, Canada added 1.3 million people, which is a lot in one year. The equivalent of the US adding 11 million migrants in one year. And now, they are experiencing a housing crisis even worse than ours. And we're sleeping in tents. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) The median price of a home here is 346 grand,  in Canada, converted to US dollars, it's 487. If Barbie moved to Winnipeg, she wouldn't be able to afford her dream house and Ken would be working at Tim Hortons. -(LAUGHS) -(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING) (CLEARS THROAT) And because of mortgage debt, Canada has the highest debt to GDP ratio of any G7 nation. I don't know what that means, but it sounds bad. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING) So does their vaunted health care system, which ranks dead last among high income countries in access to primary health care  and ability to see a doctor in a day or two. And it's not for lack of spending. Of the 30 countries with universal coverage, Canada spends over 13 percent of its economy on it, which is a lot of money for free health care. Look, I'm not saying Canada still isn't a great country. It is, but those aren't paradise numbers. If Canada was an apartment, the lead feature might be "America adjacent." -(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING) -(CLEARS THROAT) And if America was a rental car, Canada would be "America or similar."  (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) And again, honestly, Canada, I'm not saying any of this 'cause I enjoy it. I don't, 'cause I've always enjoyed you. But I need to cite you as a cautionary tale to help my country. And the moral of that tale is, "Yes, you can move too far left." And when you do, you wind up pushing the people in the middle to the right. At its worst, Canada is what American voters think happens when there's no one putting a check on extreme wokeness. Like the saga of Canadian shop teacher, Kayla Lemieux,  whose pronouns are she/her and those. -(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING) -(LAUGHS) Kayla is now back to being a guy named Kerry, but two years ago when "they" showed up to teach children, the progressive high school "they" taught at said that they-- They, the school, not the person. -(AUDIENCE LAUGHING) -(CLEARS THROAT) Really? You couldn't have found another word? We were using that one. -Anyway, okay. -(AUDIENCE LAUGHING) They were committed to a safe environment for gender expression. Safe for who? What about the children?  -(SCOFFS) What-- -(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING) What about the equipment in that shop class? -(AUDIENCE LAUGHING) -(PIERS MORGAN LAUGHING) -You know, there-- (CHUCKLES) -(PIERS CHUCKLING) You know, there was once a weirdo D-list movie producer in the '60s named Russ Meyer who made low-budget B movies like And Always featuring women who look like this. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) His movies played in porn houses and were featured in Okay, fine, but who says, "No, when it comes to huge, ridiculous tits, let's save that for the kids."  -(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING) -(CHUCKLES) And this is why people vote for Trump. They say in politics, liberals are the gas pedal and conservatives are the brakes, and I'm genuinely with the gas pedal, but not if we're driving off a cliff. On the trans issue, America is no ands, ifs, or buts about it, absolutely alone in the world now. An outlier country. Last month, England's National Health Service announced that there's "not enough evidence to support the safety or clinical effectiveness"  of puberty blockers for third graders, and that they were going to stop fumbling around with children's privates, because that's Prince Andrew's job. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING) (CHUCKLES) Sorry, you two. -(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, CHEERING) -(CHUCKLES) They're very sensitive about the royal family. -I'm telling you, I found out... -He is. We'll make an exception for you, Bill. -BILL MAHER: All right. -Exactly. (CHUCKLES) So too with all the other good place countries in direct opposition to America's choice  to affirm children's wishes on switching gender, no matter the age or psychiatric history. The Far Left, which always like to use, "Well, Europe does it." Yeah, no, that doesn't work on this one anymore. -(AUDIENCE LAUGHING) -Or on immigration. Sweden opened its borders to over a million and a half immigrants since 2010. And now 20 percent of its citizens are foreign-born and its education system is tanking, and it has Europe's highest rate of gangland killings. And one result is that the far-right parties  are in the government now there for the first time. To which liberals say, "Blaming immigrants for the rising crime rate is racist." Yeah, but is it true? Of course, it's true. It's not a coincidence. The quality of life went down after the Somali gangs started a drug turf war using hand grenades. Calling it "racist" doesn't solve the problem. It hands future elections to someone who will solve the problem, and who, I promise, you're not going to like. 	Leaning Conservative			Liberal	145

of options to the political Echelon to  calculate the next steps Lindsay Israel is still weighing its response Brit thank you the Iranian strike is intensifying concerns about a wider conflict in the region and US officials who knew an attack was coming were shocked by the scale ABC's Chief Global Affairs correspondent Martha Raditz reports from Washington tonight a senior Us official telling ABC news that the US had only been expecting Iran to fire perhaps a dozen ballistic missiles instead with swarms of drones approaching Israel the head of us  Central Command General Eric Killa informed the National Security team of a stunning new number there would likely be more than 100 ballistic missiles launched the senior official saying the number was so shocking his hand was trembling as he took notes the US had already prepositioned additional defense Assets in the red and Mediterranean seas and with a help from the UK and others the Iranian missiles were tracked from the moment they

to try and prevent this from spiraling into a wider War we are told that in their phone call last night President Biden urged Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu to slow things down to think carefully and strategically about the risk of escalation Iran's government we are also told sent a message to the White House as this attack was underway suggesting that they're finished after this that they consider this matter to be closed  now as for what comes next the White House says ultimately it is up to Israel to decide whether and how to respond but officials here tonight tell us that the US will not participate in any Counterattack Lindsay certainly lots of concern about what might come next Mary from the White House thank you over on Capitol Hill House Republicans are hoping to push

House Republicans are Rush are rushing to craft an aid package for Israel that could pass as early as this week but there is one obstacle sources tell me and that is long-stalled military aid for Ukraine Hardline Republicans want to only focus on Israel but including Ukraine could make the package more appealing to Democrats now the Senate passed a massive multi-billion doll foreign aid package that includes 60 billion in aid for Ukraine as well as 14 billion for Israel and in that is 4  billion for missile defense and about 1 billion for to build something called the iron beam

Trump will become the first former president to stand trial as a criminal defendant lawyers will start whittling a jury pool of hundreds to 12 plus six alternates jury selection is largely luck it depends who you get prosecutors have said there's no chance of finding potential jurors without an opinion of trump the judge will insist that that view should not get in the way of being  fair and impartial so potential jurors will be asked 42 questions including whether they've attended a trump campaign event follow him on social media or have strong feelings about how he has been treated Trump has complained too many potential jurors have been exposed to negative stories about him it's very unfair that I'm having a trial there he sought to postpone the trial so it can be moved out of Manhattan the judge refused though saying pre-trial publicity was at least in part of his own doing far from The Prestige of the  White House and the glitz of his golf clubs Trump will sit in a drab courtroom while prosecutors try to prove he falsified business records to hide hush money payments to porn actress Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election Trump denies those charges but if he's convicted he faces the possibility of up to four years in prison and Lindsay while he could still run for president he would not be able to vote for himself Lindsay many find that perplexing Aaron

M190	https://youtu.be/jSp6ES2YliU?si=ToRn8DpEtPDGFEiW	all right guys what we're doing today is a lot of Gunner react segment stuff but an interesting topic it seems that uh people from my past videos that I've covered before are all kind of finding themselves in new hot water we just covered Chile decastro going to jail for 6 months I mean that one's pretty crazy and then another one we're looking at is Derek grz who might be a predator I mean it's it's weird that people I get into beef with that they end up either going to jail or maybe being Predators it  seems a little higher sticks and I thought it would be when I first got into this whole YouTube gang YouTube game I mean there could be YouTube gangs too that's that's a fraudi and slip I mean I don't know what people are capable of on this platform all right so Derek grz is uh this guy this guy right there quick backstory uh me and Jake dittle made a video together where we made fun of him doing uh door Dash pranks in college where he just like spill the food and stuff it was whatever and then he uh challenged to fight me  which was so weird he like tweeted at me I'm giving you two options pick wisely under Cline you have 24 hours to accept my boxing match or I'm going to drop the greatest hit single on your fat ass I am Derek RZ call my bluff call my bluff your viewers are all six-year-old Roblox virgins an epic tweet an epic lay tweet had this one it just burned into my mind at this point I didn't respond and he never dropped the diss track I was very disappointed I was super disappointed he never dropped it I was  so excited sucks anyways I think this is a fun video 30 minutes to me just kind of going over his live stream where he's looking at me and Jake's video uh yelling just nonsensical mostly just calling us fat and gay the whole time not exaggeration who's the F he's just he's just like an 18-year-old annoying streamer but apparently he's kind of gotten like into this whole kick Predator Fiasco and I had no idea until uh people very nicely let me know in Discord so there was something I'm sure you guys have seen  this something about chickens posted to catch a kick Predator basically exposing this guy whoever the is Riot something and like he's actually a predator predator like I think he was you know it was like very young girls on like Omega or something and he was lying about age and stuff I don't know too many details um but regardless this kind of brought up people looking to other people on kick that were predator esque and Derek Raz in the mix so we're going to watch a video called Kick's biggest  predator by streaming Spotlight who oompaville also referenced in his video covering it too I haven't seen any of this so we're doing some live react baby predator it's fun let's go let's make it funny um wow all right this is some horrid God damn this is so much worse than I thought this would be it turns out it was kind of hard to make that funny at least at first the video we watched was from streaming Spotlight and it was a text to speech voiceover of Derek's alleged sex crimes one he's actually admitted to and I think it just  showed a little bit too much context if you get what I mean like way too much context that we didn't need to see I feel like we should be watching this in dereck's response that we look at after though he's responding and reacting to another YouTuber called the Asher show who makes a video going over the same allegations in this video but does it in a much better and more digestible way so before the funny part of Derek just being really stupid in his response I need to catch you up on the context and  clips that I watched beforehand so you know what I know before we watch that video together does that make sense I I I hope that makes sense first Derek makes weird sexualized live stream content this I already knew yeah this was the weird thing about his streams it's like it's like horny like we're talking about before kick was even a platform he's been doing this for a long time he did this on Twitch two Derek had secret streams where he invites girls over and had a hidden camera set up where he aggressively  tries to get with and does eventually end up having sex with them on his hidden camera live stream with a lot of people watching uh this is a crime in all states in the US I'm going to hell I'm going to hell internally BR I'm up wait think us is so how do you even how are you even aware that what you're doing is up and you still do it you're ubering because why because Jesus only 5 minutes in there's still 18 minutes left of proof I wonder how Derek responds to this I'm so curious I kind of want to  skip to that now but we'll we'll keep watching so what's the point of coming this Jesus dude I just don't kiss I get ahead and put my feedback is his goal to have sex on camera right now like is that how little like he gives a about kick to thanks AI guy his response to this has to be that it's fake obviously I try to keep this light but this is so much worse than I thought it was I I I thought this was could plan it off buddy oh my God no way I just was the whole entire thing oh my God bro okay no way I just I  just live streamed an essay what the hell no way I just live streamed a crime what no way I could go to jail for this what the why did I live stream this and finally Derrick is accused of sending nudes and sex tapes of his once ex-girlfriend to a mod in his chat for money uh and since it was an older relationship his ex-girlfriend would have been some 16 years old in these photos and videos therefore under agage and therefore selling child p word that's also a crime in all states too if you didn't know that one just there's  also leak screenshots from Derek on his live streams that show a Twitter DM conversation verifying the ex-girlfriend's name that he sold these nudes of allegedly we see a video I mean okay with that out of the way a lot of this will be brought back up in Derrick's response to the Astro show but now you're caught up in what I knew going into what we're about to look at right now you can watch the full video from the first one from streaming Spotlight in the description as well as the full video from the Asher show which  is what we're going to be looking at Derek looking at right now also linked in the description now on to Derrick's response apparently we have a video of Derek Raz responding to the allegations too uh I'm sure he'll take that very seriously this is his video a kick streamer who has been falsely accused oh god dude I I'm just already a description I'm a 19-year-old streamer who's been streaming since I was 16 I am not a terrible person I'm young and most importantly human all all humans make mistakes I'm sure everybody watching  this video has made an irrational decision and later regret it I admit my faults and take full accountability of my actions and what I've have done wrong I reflected and became a better person I just currently reflected and became a better person just now on other words I was painted as an awful human being which is not the case these were things in that interet video that were not true in the whole entire video even starting from the start paint me as someone I am not a lot of this was completely taken  out of content which is resulted in a kickban he's really not good at spelling that was also something that we went over a long time ago all right Derek what do you got to say I'm not watching this whole thing it's 30 minutes but let's do a little bit hello everybody so the reason why I'm making this video today is because my name was painted in a very bad Spotlight um and I wanted to go over it with you guys and tell you guys what the truth is this is unfortunately the loudest this goes you you're making an apology video  and you couldn't make the volume loud enough come on man come on now know me um basically my name is drick RZ um I'm a streamer and I've been streaming for 3 to four years now um I started streaming on Twitch when I was around 15 to 16 playing fortnite and just playing video games so right now my content consists of you know just Discord calls um playing video games here and there you know doing like just challenges you know um YouTube Vlog what is this a job interview dude like the way he comes off is so  bizarre yeah no I I'm not doing any hidden camera uh uh sex stuff uh sex crimes I'm doing I'm just doing challenges I'm doing I'm doing Discord calls I'm doing snap chat challenge calls that's what it is it's not I'm not actually doing anything bad um interaction content with my chat so basically on live streams you know I would have people over I would talk to them talk to my chat um I would play video games talk to my chat this is how I talk to like an an or uncle about how I stream so basically I'm just  interacting with my chat and we do we do games talk to me dude did you do the crimes or not so basically as you guys know a lot of things have happened recently um and I don't want to waste your guys' time so I'm going to react to this video on 30 minutes long 30 minutes long too late for that but let's get back into his streaming career because his terrible Tik toks and his thirst traps on Instagram aren't the problem it's okay so off the bat before even getting into what I did um should have reacted to this dude not the AI man I  agree but oompaville used the AI man as credit so I looked at that video we should just watched this video this video looks way easier to get through this YouTuber tries to frame me as just some like sexualized person um showing my cringey tip Tik toks and then even even the little thing frame you as some sexualized person bro that's all of your Tik toks it's not framing you you're in the frame that we're looking at if that's if that's what you mean by frame yeah literally you you do sexualizing content even the little  things like showing my you know my gym picture and and saying it's a thirst trap like I'm I was confident going to the gym um and showing off what I worked very hard for my body so even trying you're being accused of sex crimes bro this isn't the right argument your first argument is that you're confident in your body there's there's heavier stuff here man this is a weird way to start I understand that my Tik toks were cringe but at the time and this is still how I pay the bills this this this Tik Tok  account has gotten almost $500,000 and I started a viral Trend so I understand that it is cringey but at the same time it's what's helping me out and helping my career out and as far as the gym pictures go it's not a thirst trap it's it's it's something that I worked for and I've been proud of my body so I'm showing it off cuz most of my viewers are a male audience oh my god dude he's so dumb he's just so dumb that he doesn't know how to address criticism the whole thing that's happened so far only thing  is the guy has said this is Derek grass he makes some sexual content here's then then this is going to transition to the actual problem which is his secret streams just own it yes you make sexual content that's it off the bat he's trying to make me look like a sexualized person but that is not at all you are girls doing the next stream is literally you shirtless is cooking up with a girl yes you are oh my God he's so stupid yelling at people in Discord calls personally I was just saying I'm not start de over a I'm right here  right now he even gave up the occasional advice wow it's so much easier to flirt with a girl when you have again this was taken out of context this was a joke in my chat um he still this video is still trying to before he get to what I did he trying to frame me as just this terrible human being but this was not true at all um at the time I love my girlfriend a lot I would I wouldn't cheat on her so again this is a joke in my chat and before getting into I don't believe you I just I just do not believe you but  somewhere along the way he gets an indefinite ban on Twitch U my name is Derek G um I was a streamer on Twitch I had about like 50,000 50,000 followers um and you know they was starting to do a career for me um and on January 27th U my account Derek RZ was it definitely suspended oh yeah this is the lore I don't know about so he already got banned from twitch before I think he got banned that was a clip that me and Jake laughed at in his video is that he said he got banned from twitch from Instagram  from uh Facebook from Tinder and we laughed at it we're like how are you banned from every single platform at 18 years old like you got to be doing something wrong don't you think I taking out the industry tried to get rid of me call me put on or I wnab be but you can't knock me off my grind but it's fine in his own words he still has YouTube and Tik Tok to grind he even made a promo video talking about his move from twitch to you picking up girls on Tinder while fighting with their girlfriend on the  phone is crazy also like I'm also friends with him it's not like some random guy I've again in out of context clip where this Creator tries to make me look a terrible human being um if you watch me and have watched a stream you know in this exact clip um my girlfriend at the time did matter in fact cheat on me so me and my chat were just you know playing the game in joking around because we found out that she cheed me in this exact stream so I'm not a terrible person what what what is this defense I don't  even know what that means all he says is everything's a joke no it's not everything isn't a joke I you can tell when he's when he's doing a joke but it's like double layered as it being real he does that all the time like he'll say some awful say it's a joke but he also believes it at the same time that was scripted it was F kick we're good bro don't worry not happen we're good I see now he's just doing a joke like the same thing we saying before like oh kick it's it's all scripted kick don't shut it down it's  all scripted kick don't worry that's a joke but it's also not because it wasn't scripted that's the joke his joke is doubled see that's good content oh until he got banned on YouTube as well banned on YouTube for 7 days and leading into this video it almost tries to make again he tries to paint me as a terrible character um showing all these out of context Clips showing all these clips from months and months he's really trying to go with the out of context thing dude what show the context Derek  show it you're being accused of sex crimes Derek potentially spreading child porography you should maybe show the context this is a better video to watch honestly even him watching this video I like this guy it's not I got banned on YouTube because someone in my chat had posted a a nudity in my Discord server um from I don't know like a um only and I love my community I love my community like we do whatever man uh so someone just posted some nudes in my Discord you know as they do as my Discord does a  yeah he's trying to act so adult that's what got me banned so it wasn't from my actions in what I did on YouTube to get me banned it was because just something that I showed by accident on so yes it was your actions you showed a nude on your live stream that's still your fault what turbulence check what okay I don't know what's this from and again these clips I'm not ashamed to say that's what I do that's what makes me happy God it's I just just for anyone anyone who ever has allegations of sex  crimes of illegal sex crimes potential potential essay uh a spreading of child p word you don't start with trying to defend you doing the helicopter dick that's just no one gives a that's just who I am I'm the helicopter dick guy that's just what I do and I'm proud of that I'm not ashamed of that you're being being accused of some very serious stuff here Derek you got banned from your only platform that makes you money this guy's trying to paint me as a sexual deviant I'm proud of the helicopter dick though that's pretty  cool I can helicopter dick with my shirt I can do that but uh but this guy's trying to paint me in a weird light I'm not this sexual guy I'm proud of my body I'm proud of my body and I you know it just so no one gets me trying to be a hypocrite here yes I threw around the idea of doing a boner stream I'm not going to say that that wasn't going to be a sexual stream though all right you're not catching me any you're not catch a't hypocrisy for me dear Derek grz your account has been temporarily suspended due to breach of terms of  service reason sexually explicit content if you've been banned on three separate platforms why would you continue doing exactly what you're doing well again the reason why I was banned on Kick um for sex supicious content for that time was because I was on omegal um and I strolled past you know a guy put it I I scroll p a guy jerking off I don't want to say that I'm sorry for you you know saying I will piss a guy for jerking off and I was I really don't want to say that that's really that's really hard for me to say the guy  who just did helicopter dick that's really hard for me to say a guy jerking off that's very difficult for me to even to even say the guy who's been banned three times for sexual content this is very difficult for me dumb and didn't delete the VOD so back to what I was saying again it's just he's trying to put all this clips and make me seem like a terrible person yeah we know it's a lot of cont this time per I get banned for anything I got banned for just me showing something stupid on stream um  and not doing the VOD fast enough yep yep yep yep yep shows a video where the streamer and part owner of kick train Rex donated $5,000 to him train Rex donated $5,000 that's a lot of love take 5,000 for that level of Love brother basically while he's doing a horny isn't train Rax like in his 30s owns the company you're donating to this dude what oh maybe he was just randomly donating to people on the platform but he's like literally in the middle of one of his streams that we were talking about before where he's got a girl over  just doing horny like even their sub goals on the side in this stream on the side five Subs equals make out 10 Subs equals lick whipped cream and get cream pied face 20 Subs reflex challenge 50 Subs try not to fold challenge 100 Subs sleep stream with TTS 200 Subs matching tattoo 400 Subs Bella's underwear 500 Subs equals release of tape he's like in the middle of a horny stream this is even like trying to get you it's just it just is the stream you're doing basically giving him a pat on the back for streaming on Kick and  tell yeah absolutely when your owner is giving you money for that that's crazy two years ago I was banned on Twitch for no reason no timing nothing my account was just gone I felt hopeless so depressed for months my life went from the highest point crashing straight to the bottom the feeling Cann not be described how bad I felt I don't think Ki realizes how many people they pulled out of depression and gave them hope to be a success uccessful Creator and chase their I don't think kick Real is how many people they've saved from  depression I mean yeah a bunch of that would have been banned on Twitch like you that's like 10 people I mean I don't I don't know how many people they've saved for depression what dreams I don't know why he said that he was banned for no reason there was a reason and he knows what it was because he admits it in his apology video to Twitch now I don't understand why this part was even addit in the video during this time period um I was I think I would say around 16 years old and um I was permanently banned on Twitch  and during this time period I I dropped out of school um me and my girlfriend of 3 years just broke up my friend crashed my car I basically dedicated my whole enre my whole entire life into my streaming career and got it all taken away from me just like this and during this time period I genuinely was so depressed and suicidal and just so lost in life way to flip it way to flip it dude I don't know why this is being included I I was suicidal back then it was included we're talking about your banned for nudity why did you get banned  let's focus on why did you get banned that's what we're looking at and this was probably the most terriblest time during my life terriblest and the fact that this Creator is turning oh my God that against me and what oh my God he doesn't know that no one knows that he's not turning that against you he doesn't know that he's not laughing at you saying oh look he was he was suicidal he's crashed his car he was was having the most terriblest time of his life he's pulling this up to show that you got banned from  twitch 2 years ago for sexual explicit content I was going through a lot you know kick just opened up I was grinding I was streaming a kick every single day trainer came in my chat gave me over $8,000 this was posted on dextr and just so many big news articles and his creator is trying to come at the time when I was depressed and turned that against me oh my God you so so ire video so far has gone at you're so dumb and so stupid like to follow his train of logic is just so idiotic my lowest of lows and made me  look like a terrible person and then now he's even coming at my high points in my career and just oh no not your high points okay well then when can we come at you if we can't come at you at your lowest and we can't come at you at your highest when when can we come at you is you just never that is just not okay in any aspect at all oh dude you called you you called me and Jake fat and gay for like 30 minutes you were you you were incessantly an now I sound like him because I can't say words incessantly an you're a bully  you just are like there's footage upon footage of you just being the worst person you can't take the high and mighty Road especially when he's not even coming at you for that he just said you you got B booted off twitch two years ago I got this post on my subreddit r/ thee show that read you should consider covering the streamer he's just as bad as Riot LW and if you remember RI L is a person I talked about previously that would secretly record women exposing themselves on camera and post it in his Discord server so let me  go through this one part at a time kick streamer Derek grass has been exposed for secretly streaming girls via hidden camera performing sex acts so Dereck would have streams where he would go through his Snapchat opening pictures that girls would send him exposing their nudes to people people watching his streams and when he got away with doing this he decided to ramp it up he would match with people on Tinder invite them over so basically like this guy's like basically like he's kind of just saying  everything like is is like it's kind of like all out of it's kind of just like out of uh fully out of like it's kind of just like uh like out of context it's kind of just like out of context like what you don't get here is that like I'm actually a good person he's trying to frame me in a bad light is what's is what's happening um I was also suicidal and filmed everything that so again that Snapchat allegation is also a false allegation there has never been a single time in the four years I have been  streaming that I've ever exposed a nude on Snapchat um my Snapchat streams consist of me just swiping up on you know people's public story um or St them like just like stupid cringy you know corny pickup lines and just corny trying to rise them up as a joke this clip again what this Creator just said is fully not true not true at all again there's never been a point in my life that I've showed any type of nude on Snapchat on Snapchat wait what did what did Astro show say exactly so Dereck would have  streams where he would go through his Snapchats opening pictures that girls would send him exposing their nudes to people watching his streams and when he got away with doing this he decided that maybe I don't know a single time in the four years I have been streaming I would be surprised I mean you know honestly all that says to me is that he didn't get nudes like cuz a Snapchat is you don't know what the it is before you click on it it just shows the Red Square he's trying to get these girls to  send nudes that I know for sure we've seen that so if they didn't send you nudes they didn't send you nudes if they did you would have shown a nude on your live stream that's just what that's just what would have happened so you got no Riz is what I'm saying basically okay so now that he's painted me as this type of person um now in this video he's going to get into the mistakes that I've done um and now I am going to let this full entire clip play out because I want you guys to you know see what happened I  don't want to hide anything um this is the you know one point in my career that I did truly mess up um and I want you guys to just fully see it and I want you guys to watch it and I don't want to hide any of it on my account on my so that was real all right yeah case closed case closed we've seen this this this okay if he admits to it Case Closed dude you're a creep you you committed a sex crime you use a hidden camera sexually pressured a girl into giving you a hand job when she wanted to leave and you did  it on camera and you kept it on and you admit to it you shouldn't be allowed anywhere you should be banned yes you're trying to admit to it cuz you want to get back on Jesus this isn't a small thing that you just like oh I I what he say in his in his uh description he said I reflected and became a better person dog in this stream in that in that live stream you literally say before you set up the hidden camera I'm going to hell I know I'm going to hell you knew it was bad I'm going to hell dude this is awful  I shouldn't be doing this okay I'm going to put the camera right here and um so he basically matched with this girl I I literally have no clue what she looks like I I have no clue she looks like she's going to come over and I'm going to set up the camera like like a like like a like a like a like a uh what's it called like a like a head in camera and then um I'm going to have an air piece I'm going to have the headphones I'm going to have my Hy up I'm going to have my Hy up so much pre had a heades so much pre heades  little a TTS every single donation like with a TTS it's going to like it's so you guys to say and see what to do bro reuploaded and there's a part where he takes off his pants and he starts becoming more aggressive with this girl that he invites over she says that she's ubering home and he begs her to stay ubering why because why you there why you you there she stays for a bit longer they lie down on the couch and you can see that there's some hand activity happening underneath the covers and that's when he decides to get up and  turn on the camera he didn't get banned for this at all even though she didn't consent to being on camera he even admits that the camera was there secretly and I'm going to set up the camera like like a like like a like a like a like a uh what's it called like a like a hidden camera but when I saw this I thought maybe it wasn't real thought it was a setup situation because of the way that he reacted your only way out that's your only way out questions and she doesn't seem to want to answer because she's suspicious of this camera  setup and she says something I feel like and this is what I said okay I'm glad me and Ash on the same page here what I was saying is that when AI voice gu showed us this clip I was more reasonable to this one being scripted slash she knows it's a live stream because she points it out it it had more bearing to it the first one not so much TR to something the I'm scared now you have a camera there I off oh so it's on no appears thing she think goes to change her clothes and okay so after that whole  entire let me cut off right here she think goes to change your clothes okay guys okay hold on video he's now gotten to the mistakes that I have made um now I'm not going to sh Cod it I'm not going to hide anything um basically during this time period um in the past four years of me streaming I did two um secret streams you can call it now what these consisted of is I had I had a girl come over I match on Tinder and I hid the camera um and I wore like two air pieces in my ears and I would have you  know TTS on shocked he's admitting to this I'm actually shocked the last thing I expected was him to admit to this I thought he was just going to say this is fake this is bizarre his lawyer is crying I mean you I can't believe he just admitted to this that is crazy TS on and my chat with donate and basically tell me what to do um and tell me how to act now this and a never this this is not okay in a million years um I'm I was young I was I was stupid you know I let the views dog I think this was like a  year and a half ago oh now I want to know the date now I want to know the date we we'll look we'll look at it I think this was I think this was at most two years ago he's 20 now he said he's 19 here I he was either 18 to 20 years old and just my chat kind of get into my head and tell me to do and I try to blame it on chat no that's a good move I I'm going to use that one to one day and it will it will work for me cuz my chat is are criminals and are and try to make me do things I don't want to do chat  blaming is something else that is a wild strategy so he admits to it but he still blames chat um I'm I was young I was I was stupid you know I let the views and just my chat kind of get into my head and tell me to do and I try to be the good person by listening to them but after reflection I realized that was terrible I don't condone that you can't you can't use the views got to my head excuse for this it's just a different level man it's just a different level at all at the time I didn't realize how  this can you know mess up you know the girl's livelihood it can make them feel uncomfortable it can just you know kind of just ruin their life and this right here was it can make them feel uncomfortable it could ruin their life yeah just not okay um and I deeply regret doing this I've reached out to you know both these girls that have been on my hidden camera streams um I've formally apologized we know we've talked about it and again it was just extremely messed up and it was something not okay  to do at the time you know a bunch of streamers they were doing it you know um and I kind of seen it as like a you know a hidden camera you know prank show or whatever like a reality TV kind of he really he really does see it that way oh my god dude that's what I was joking about before he's like this is our prank show today today we're doing sexual assault just a prank though just a prank though this is my prank show where we where we touch girls without them knowing there's a camera in the room it's just a prank he really saw  it that way oh my Lord you know a hidden camera you know prank show or whatever like a reality TV kind of thing and that was not okay at all I completely like misjudged the situation and I misjudged the whole entire thing um and it was just genuinely genuinely deep down it was messed up I'm not going to lie about that part that was messed up um since then I have changed as a person you know I it it it makes me like think I can't give him any credit for for for get taking accountability on it like you  really can't it's just a whole other level dude it's just a whole other level it doesn't matter you didn't change as a person this was less than two years ago and think like know what's okay and what's not okay but yeah I think it was morally you know messed up um it was something that I should have never done in a million years and it it was dumb it was extremely stupid um I I didn't think or know how bad it was at the time but looking back at it I can you know I can see how you know messed up it was and I  like to apologize to you know after you got banned after you got banned from kick now you suddenly see how bad it was ain't that weird I suddenly reflected and changed as a person really quickly over the course of 24 hours isn't that really strange I've suddenly instantly become better after after I've lost my source of Revenue that's that's interesting what was the point of the first 15 minutes of this apology the first 15 minutes so these are taken out of context he's trying to paint me all sexual stuff just for the second half of  the video be like yes I committed a sex crime yes that's me committing a sex crime on camera yep that's me I did that yes my community and you guys for even you know promoting those type of actions um and thinking that's okay because it's not I like to apologize to kick for even bringing it on the platform and doing something so you know V vital and just cruel on the platform and you know obviously I'd like to apolog this by the way this is Derek grass who I have a video about a long time ago about a year  ago who wanted to fight me and here he is now being a predator to these girls because none of this is platform and you know obviously I'd like to apologize to these girls because none of this is okay these actions are not okay um and I after you know watching what I did and doing something so you know V vital and just cruel on the platform and so vital doing actions that are so vital did I can truly see you know how how messed up how messed up it really was it was it was messed up there's no shirt coating  it um I'm taking full accountability I'm not going to hide that I want you guys to see this I want to grow as a person I want to grow you know with my community and become a better person no what what this means is you grow as a person and you lose the community you don't get a community after this you lo you lose it that's your accountability what your accountability looks like is you lose your community that's what your accountability is you don't just say I take accountability there's got to be  some consequence Derek you lost your platform that's it I misread the situation and I just did something stupid um you know forre the situation what does that even mean misread the situation you created the situation there's no misreading it you wrote the situation it's your story reviews and just whatever my brain was thinking at the time but it was truly it it was morally wrong it was morally wrong and messed up and I deeply regret doing that um and it it was just fully messed up so again I like to apologize to kick um for  bringing that like to apologize to you know these girls which I have reach talk them about it and like to apologize to you guys for even condoning that stuff and I'd like to apologize to myself because I'd like to apologize to you guys for even condoning that stuff is that what he said like to apologize to you guys for even condoning that stuff and I don't think he knows what that word means because you wouldn't apologize to your community for allowing it you would say that's up on you guys too I'd like to apologize to myself  because this action genuinely messed up and ruined a good aspect in my life and I don't think you can do that I don't think that's how that works I don't think I don't think you can apologize to yourself Derek pres yes Derek former I'm so Derek pres I'm so sorry that I hidden camera sexually crimedesk former to Derrik presant it's fine I accept your apology thank you Derek former as Derek presant when we go to court this should all be okay cuz I've accepted my own apology your honor I accepted my own apology for real for  real you can't lock me up and I I I think I do need a consequence I think it was terrible so I do fully agree with that it was awful that was the first allegation that was put on my that's only the first one and he admitted to that one all right so I'll say the second one's probably fit name was they do the hashtag free Derek again oh my God this is the thing he used to do when he got banned on on Twitch and Instagram and Tinder it was the whole thing was # freed Derek ah this time it's # put Derek away way now now it's it's #  lockup Derek I don't you can't be rocking that same hashtag anymore man it was messed up it was morally wrong I shouldn't never done that and it was just genuinely stupid it was really dumb um and I you know I feel like a piece of for doing it I think it was so stupid and never in a million years would I repeat the same actions that I have done because it did cause harm and how many years can you just say one more time how many years you wouldn't do this again cuz I I think I missed you the first time cuz it seems like it's only  been less than a few years you're saying how many a million years and never in a million years would I million it was a milli so that was the first allegation and now he gets into the second allegation and that what to play second allegation I just I he's such a idiot on top of everything he's just dumb and that makes me mad when he does bad cuz he's also dumb on top of it there's no point in quote in quoting second allegation it is the second allegation now let me get into the second part of this Reddit post he's  also live streamed himself selling nudes and sex tapes of his two ex-girlfriends one of them apparently has a large following on social media and was under rage at the time once again Derrick is streaming this time this is the second accusation that brought my name so basically um this YouTuber is trying to fra uh claim that I was he's on a loop he is on a loop dude he just said frame instead of claim because he just nonstop just kept saying so basically YouTube trying to frame me in a certain light  which he said 20 times so he just accidentally said it again so basically um this YouTuber is trying to fra uh claim that I was um live streaming me selling explicit photos of my underage ex-girlfriend now this claim is completely false it's completely false and let me explain why so a bunch of these claims come from a bunch of you know Reddit users right and to give you guys the backstory so basically about a month ago um I was in Florida and I had my my editor my fil and my friend and he basically was filming for me editing my  videos and I took him to Jack do Hardy's house right and me and Jack do Hardy got into a altercation and basically I was kicked out of Jack to Hardy's house um and Jack you know told my friend my car man my editor that he would give him you ever have that one friend or cousin or sibling who is trying to tell a story and you're just like get to the meat I don't care about how the early of your week was what happened on Wednesday that's what talk about Wednesday I don't care what happened on Monday or

M222	https://youtu.be/L5MwYt2_52M?si=z9rxTGL0ewT_R8Nt	Tucker Carlson went on Joe Rogan every month we get an example of Tucker trying to promote his latest Venture by going on some show or doing some stunt or you know reupping a a discredited story about Obama's gay sex from like 2008 and trying to refresh it which would again be the coolest thing about Obama if you're secretly gay well did you hear that they were also doing coke allegedly in this um I mean look Coke is a problematic drug smoking it too smoking cocaine wow yes um and also that out the  man that had alleged that had uh previously I think gone to jail for fraud or some other crimes um but Tucker decided that you know he's time time to relaunch his media career with this very cold case into the scops um I just think he's having a lot of pro trouble like actually maintaining maintaining an audience and it's so satisfying because this happened to Bill O'Reilly too when he was forced out of Fox News uh due to his sexual harassment the the the machine makes these guys they are really just actors  catering to the audiences on Prime Time Fox News and they don't have too much to offer outside of the the gears that they turn in the massive machine that is Fox News so Tucker's latest attempt to gain some headlines is questioning the theory of evolution um again like this is an old thing I remember being a new atheist or a young atheist or whatever I was when I was 14 thinking Bill ma was edgy and watching religionist oh they go to the museum that says evolution is really science like what stupid idiots I grew  out of that at maybe 15 years old um but this is apparently now what we're returning to Tucker Carlson now siding with the anti-evolution folks and enslave us well let's say no to slavery how's that is that a tough one not for me yeah I mean and maybe a good use of nuclear weapons would be to hit the data centers no I'm I'm Ser like why is that crazy it's not it's not if you think that human beings are the end of this evolutionary CH well what else is some supercomputer in a data center outside  dullas airport no you know what I me like I don't actually think that individuals I don't think I'm that important my life is that important I don't I will die I know that and I try to keep that in mind every day but you're important to everybody that you that cares about you you're important to the people around if we don't think if we don't think people are important then what do we think is important I guess that's what I'm saying not necessarily that we don't think people are important but if if if evolution is real and if  there is this I don't know but it's it's it's visible like you can measure it in certain animals you can measure adaptation yeah but there's no evidence that EV in fact I think we've kind of given up on the idea Evolution the theory of evolution as articulated by Darwin is like kind of not true in what in what sense well in the most basic sense the idea that you know all life emerg from a single cell organism and over time and there would be a fossil record of that and there's not and there's not a fossil  record of uh transitionary species like species that are adapting to its environment there tons of record of adaptation and you see it in your own life I mean I have a lot of dogs I I see adaptation in dogs you know through the sure can you pause it lit I mean a fossil record of what he's describing here would be would have to be I mean at the outset of like the very very early days of this planet I mean that is a very high bar that he is asking science to climb and then disproving the entire Theory this is a classic and I'll go  back to my new atheist days this is a classic fallacy of creationist this is called the god of the gaps which is that any Gap in the fossil record because of course they're going to be one once you add a new thing to the fossil record there's a gap between that one and the previous and the thing preceding it um shows that we don't know anything but yes no actually Tucker's wrong um we do share a a common ancestor all life also the there's a common sense explanation for the gaps given the fact that it's  incredibly difficult to record this um and all right let's keep going and just to be clear they were talking about like AI broad I figured that out stupid dogs I I see adaptation in dogs you know through the sure um litter to litter but no there's no evidence at all that none zero that you know people you know evolve seamlessly from a single amoeba no there's not there's not there's no chain in the fossil record of that at all and that's why you don't actually hear people you hear them make reference to Evolution because the  theory of adaptation is clearly obviously true but Darwin's theory is totally un that's why it's still a theory almost 200 years later you know take gravity is still a theory keep going yeah that's why it's still a theory almost 200 years later you know um no we have not found that at all and I can't even guess I mean I have my own theories on it but they're not proven what are your theories okay pause it so this is what's incredible about this dumbass your theory that you're you know sitting in  your the The Woodshed he totally uses all the time remember that thing having a glass of bourbon is not the same as scientific theory it's not the same as the theory of evolution nor is it the same as uh the the theory of gravitational pull of gravity whatever these are scientifically tested theories versus the colloquial uh usage of a theory that you have in your own mind um or he's killed JFK because he wanted kids to not be fat that's a that's a that's a the soft Theory yeah that's a theory hypothesis  maybe but he's he's I mean they this is also a project of the right right to discredit science and Academia by completely flattening their methodology into something that like can be that anybody smoking pot and listening to Joe Rogan can come up with humans and bananas for instance uh split ancestry 1.5 billion years ago remarkably 25% of our genes remain similar these shared genes are responsible for the biological functions essential to the life of all eukariotic organisms that's bananas say  light of evolution I mean this is just this is basic we also could look quite uh you know whatever at some of the similarities between chimpanzees between Apes between humans he thinks that God maybe made all these things slightly separate right yeah okay but we actually do share not only do we share stuff with chimpanzees we share uh jeans with bananas okay I can't even guess I mean I have my own theories on it but they're not proven what are your theories God created people you know distinctly and  animals nope I mean I think that's like I think what every person on Earth thought until the mid 19th century actually right it's not a new idea they they didn't have computers they didn't have a a general understanding that we have today of the proc process do you think we understand more now yes really you don't think that we understand more today understand way less we understand so little that we're actually sitting here allowing like a bunch of greedy stupid childless childless software engineers in Northern California to like  flirt with the extinction of mankind so no sorry sorry that is not what is happening with AI what's happening with AI is a bunch of nerds got a bunch of money from a bunch of capital and they're trying to create a magic software that can replace workers that's what's happening with AI it's not going to destroy the world it's not going to this this sort of Nick Bostrom uh it's going to paperclip the entire universe thing is all that stuff is hype uh to try to get more investors to S plug more money into this machine this  is the stupidest most well I mean adaptation is also distinct From Evolution adaptation is about the environmental factors versus like literally the component of the creature or of human beings do we have more of this uh only I mean I mean he's looking for a new audience he's saying dumb yeah the thing is is like look you can decide you think he's um believable on this and then you'll be like one of those flat earthers who decide that the people who say that there's no curvature to the Earth are real it's just like not  true but you you know enjoy the community it's he's back to the Christian theocrat angle that his latest uh foray into commenting on actual world world events was to say that the Biden Administration is is um discriminating against Christians with its Gaza policy basically so he no men I mean yes there are Christian Palestinians who have been killed uh by Israel but to make that the focus you're clearly discounting the major major issues at play here in order to fit a specific kind of narrative um lawful waffle said is math  saying we're 25% banana I thought human body was 75% water given the math I have a science experiment I'm going to look into potential breakthrough stay tuned I mean I think those sort of percentage things I'm not a geneticist but I think are are are easily fudged um and maybe don't but we share an ancestor with bananas um deal with it ter um James from Houston Tucker is also conflating the study of the of the uh abiogenesis study of the origins of life and evolution as a way to measure how uh spe speciation speciation spe spe speci  spe speciation happens it's it's funny because like this brings me back to when I was reading Richard Dawkins and really loving like the selfish Gene and The Greatest Show on Earth which are good books about how this stuff happened from Jamaica um oh I just lost it or why uh most mammals embryos at this early stage look almost identical that's why Tucker Carlson couldn't uh tell the difference between a dolphin and a baby that was a Charlie Kirk I think I that was Charlie Kirk what' I say uh Tucker Carlson I think right yeah  unfortunate that that zus psycho was the one who did that I know think of that too um golden Oyster Cult said voting uncommitted with pride from Pike County Pennsylvania free Palestine allow them to control their own destiny nice thanks um Ramona Frankenstein do you think Tucker talks like that when he's uh has just a normal day conversation it's like how grandmothers tell kids not to make faces or they'll stay in that way and he got his voice stuck in that Cadence these are the questions that we  should be asking that c of him with what is it Theo V where Theo is like you got a crazy laugh don't you yeah he does weirdo Elite weirdo um Daredevil Emma maybe Tucker is right I have seen an amoeba skeleton um big mountain it's crazy watching Joe Rogan gradually become stupider and stuper with stupider which with each new interview he does oh yeah Nicholas gold is right it's the ribosomal RNA provides a huge amount of evidence and the chain between single cell organisms and us it's just you know  cope by people who like I don't feel the need to believe in a god um but I imagine it's difficult for people who uh like Tucker who I guess need to uh believe in first of all if I if I had lived life Tucker did I would not want to believe in God 	Liberal			Leaning Conservative	151

M256	https://youtu.be/k8Jo8Lahz1A?si=NQNqq_G_tVIJIu-Q	Young people have every reason to be enraged. And every issue they see, they look up, they get angry, and they see someone doing better than them. And then every day it is spitballed in their face that they are failing, that they are not doing as well as everyone around them. We have lost the script. Our kids are more anxious and more depressed and more obese and more addicted, and we have made a purposeful decision to let this happen by ensuring that people around this table stay wealthy at the cost of young people.  Author and professor Scott Galloway went on an absolute tear on Morning Joe, perfectly explaining some of the problems that young people are facing in modern America. Now, Galloway was very detailed in his analysis and covered a wide variety of topics, which will break down one by one. First is the notion that young Americans are financially worse off now than their parents were. Let's take a look. And there are people who make an exceptionally good living, but it's all current income and they live in a blue state.  They might be paying 50 to 54% tax rate. I bet some of those people are on around this table right now. But if you can make the jump to lightspeed and invest in assets, stocks, housing, then your tax rate plummets. So in America, we've decided to try and create a super class of billionaires. And then if they win the gold medal, we're going to give them the silver in the bronze. Two biggest tax deductions capital gains and mortgage interest. Who owns homes and stocks. People my age who doesn't know who rents and makes their money from current income.  Young people. So we've decided that the wealthiest people in the world should get exceptionally more wealthy. Minimum wage second 925 stock market is screamed up. The average 70 year old is 72% wealthier than they were 40 years ago. The average person under the age of 40 is 24% less wealthy. We were. We are purposely transferring more wealth from the poor and middle class to the and the upper class to the super rich and from young to old man. Look, he said a lot there. And there were points of his statement that really, really struck a nerve  with me personally, really hit home. You know, he starts off by talking about the 55% tax rate. If you live in a blue state, that includes the local taxes, state taxes and federal taxes and how you don't get the tax breaks if you haven't, if you haven't been privileged enough to afford astronomically priced houses, okay, you don't get the kind of tax benefits and deductions that people who have built a tremendous amount of wealth get to take advantage of God. That really hit home for me. And then, by the way, you add that extra layer of feeling like you're the taxes  that you pay don't actually go back to benefiting the community you live in doesn't actually make your life better. You see what the money gets wasted on. You see how much money we spend on foreign wars and things like that? Yeah. It's infuriating. Like finally you hear someone on cable television, no less vocalizing the actual rage that young Americans are feeling and accurately explaining where that rage stems from. Pausing here to deliver some honest truth, as we do in our news coverage as well.  TYT is facing challenges, guys, as the entire industry is. You know who could make the difference? You. If you hit the join button below, it's going to make all the difference and keep us in business. We appreciate you. Thank you. Look, we talk often on the show about, having open hearts, being kind, caring, decent and open minds and making sure that you don't cancel. People hear people out. So there are opinions of Scott Galloway has that I totally disagree, vehemently disagree with. Agreed. Yes.  But he was absolutely brilliant here 100%. Right. And so there's two sets of folks in the country who are the most screwed. One is the middle class because, and look, when I was poor, I didn't pay that much taxes and I got, unemployment benefits, etc.. So, look, I had a thousand other problems being poor. Right? But taxes wasn't high on the list. When they're rich, they stop paying taxes to for all the legal reasons. But that's the problem is that they change the laws so they would pay less taxes  than us, let alone capital gains. The carried interest loophole is insanity. Insanity where, like the top, venture capitalists in the world, private equity guys pay way less taxes. The billionaires, I think, on average, are paying only 8% in taxes. Okay, so it's just a crime how little taxes the rich pay. So somebody's got to lift that burden and it's a giant burden we got to pay for defense, got to pay for all these different things. Right. So they just dump everything on the middle class. The middle class pays the most by far. And they go, so what?  Take it okay. Right. But and then let me just add a little bit more to that. And then you have situations in which you know you pay your taxes. They're astronomical. If you're a working middle class American. And then in high tax states like California, 24 billion over five years spent on homelessness, they face an audit. They can't account for that money. They can't account for that money. Yeah. And guys so they're also risking a little bit of a rebellion here. The top 10% controls the country. Bottom 90% has almost no effect on policy.  Right. But the top 10% is big group. There's a the top 0.1% that's the bankers, etc. That actually control everything. And the rest of the 10% is filled with doctors, dentists, accountants, lawyers, etc. And they're coming after those guys now. So even when I was at MSNBC and I made good money, I was not in the top brackets at like in in that place where you can take advantage of all those loopholes. Right? So the doctors and the and the accounts are getting crushed now too. So there's they're fomenting rebellion without realizing  because there's so incredibly greedy. But now back to the young. The people that are suffering the most are the young, because all the rules have been changed against them and in favor of the already wealthy. And no one in the establishment ever talks about that. All they do is talk down to them, go, oh, you're lazy. Entitled millennials, Gen Z boo! So tremendous credit to Scott Galloway for accurately showing the numbers. And this is not conjecture. It is stone cold facts that young people have it much harder on housing,  student debt and in every way. So finally someone said it on TV. So I'm very appreciative of it. Yeah. And he also said like, look, this is a system that just seeks to benefit people like the people sitting at this table. So he included himself in that equation, which I, you know, I value that he said that. And I particularly like the fact that he's telling the truth and pointing out the reality involving these anchors on cable television, who I would venture to say are so disconnected from what ordinary Americans are facing.  It's I mean, it shows in their coverage of various stories. Right? So I just enjoyed that moment where he kind of called them out and how they're kind of blind to how the system benefits them and really puts young Americans at a disadvantage. Thanks for watching The Young Turks really appreciate it. Another way to show support is through YouTube memberships. You'll get to interact with us more. There's live chat emojis, badges.

the beginning of my career I didn't really understand that maybe there should be some boundaries there there were times in the DMS when I would overshare details of my life which was really weird of me I haven't done that for years you see cuz I changed my behavior and I took accountability but that's not very interesting is it so let's go on the toxic gossip train the locomotives fueled with hateful accusations the toxic gossip train steam roll over someone's reputation toxic gossip train hop on  board but CL close your eyes otherwise you'll realize that the train is made of lies and that person you despise maybe didn't deserve to die but hey at least you're having fun in all seriousness I do think it's really important to hold people accountable for their mistakes um you know we should hope that everyone can learn from their mistakes and grow and change their behavior and be a better person and this is something that I've always tried to do when I make mistakes and it's something that I will continue  to try to do what oh you don't care oh okay I thought you wanted me to take accountability but that's not the point of your mob mentality is it no your goal is to ruin the life of the person you despise while you dramatize your lies and monetize their demise yeah um I feel like I can already hear the comments on this video she's gaslighting manipulating oh she's a

comfortable with their families watching my YouTube videos or coming to my live shows now have aaz and jokes and poor taste yes yes have I made lots of dumb mistakes yes am I sad that there are some fans who feel betrayed yes it was my intention to manipulate no it doesn't really matter what my intention was because it seems as though everyone's already decided on that let me tell you it's not very fun to have millions of people all over the world call you the most vile horrendous disgusting life ruining words  that a person can be called in my opinion um it doesn't matter that these things aren't true uh everyone just believes that you are the type of person who manipulates and abuses children so I just wanted to say that um the only thing I've ever groomed is my two Persian cats I'm not a gr I'm just a loser who didn't understand I shouldn't respond to fans and I'm not a predator even though a lot of you think so because 5 years ago I made a fart joke so even though I know this video won't change anyone's mind about  me I still felt it was important to to come on here and defend myself a little and take accountability and I also wanted to say that to anyone out there who has ever supported me in any capacity I really really appreciate you thank you for what it's forth I never had any bad intentions but I do feel like the toxic gossip train chugging down the tracks of

gaps I won't survive in the crash but [Music] hey I hope you had some fun actually you know I feel like maybe I should let you guys know something um seems like maybe you're confused about something I don't know let me try to help um sometimes people make a mistake and it does and make I'm a horrible person whoo sometimes people can make a mistake and they're still a good person crazy I know sometimes people can make a mistake and you don't have to take that mistake  oh no and twist it up and grind it and add some lies to it and pulverize it and stab it with knives and ruin a life and oh

M322	https://youtu.be/qEJ4hkpQW8E?si=JyqSxd9iV_wIkVlR	My name is Scott Galloway, I teach at NYU, and I appreciate your time. I have 44 slides and 720 seconds. Let's light this candle. (Laughter) OK so for those of you who don't know me, I'm actually a global television store. True story. I've had four TV series in the last three years. Two of them have been canceled before they were launched, and two were canceled within six weeks. Let's recap. (Video) If we want to juice this thing, if we want to put a cattle prod up the ass of the economy. Bloomberg.  The most trusted name in financial news. Not for long. Andrew Yang: I'm going to do whatever I can for this country of ours. Scott Galloway: Jesus, come on, dude, you’re 0 for two. (Video ends) Face for podcasting. So first insight of the day. I'd like to be the first person to welcome you to the last TED. (Laughter) OK. By the way, it's clear -- what's it called? What are we here for? “The Brave and the Brilliant?” It's clear that Chris is a frustrated soap opera producer. (Laughter) Essentially what we have here is a telenovela  where, after a night of unbridled passion between Bill Gates and Malcolm Gladwell, they give birth to their bastard love child, Simon Sinek. (Laughter) OK, I start us with a question. Do we love our children? Sounds like an illegitimate question, right? Well, I'm going to try and convince you otherwise. Essentially, as we go down generations, we're seeing that for the last two generations, people are making less money on an inflation-adjusted basis. In addition, the cost of buying a home, the cost of pursuing education, continues to skyrocket.  So the purchasing power, the prosperity, is inversely correlated to age. Simply put, as we get younger, we're taking away opportunity and prosperity from our youngest. The social contract that is now no longer in place and for the first time in the US's history, a 30-year-old is no longer doing as well as his or her parents were at 30. This is a breakdown in the fundamental agreement we have with any society, and it creates rage and shame. (Applause) As a result, people over the age of 55 feel pretty good about America,  but less than one in five people under the age of 34 feel very good about America. This creates an incendiary. Righteous movements, cuts to our society end up becoming opportunistic infections because generally speaking, young people have a warranted envy, they're pissed off and they're angry that they don't enjoy the same spoils and prosperity that were provided to our generation. A decent proxy for how much we value youth labor is minimum wage, and we've kept it purposely pretty low. If it had just kept pace with productivity,  it'd be at about 23 bucks a share. But we've decided to purposely keep it low. Out of reach. Median home price has skyrocketed relative to median household income. As a result, pre-pandemic, the average mortgage payment was 1,100 dollars, it's now 2,300 dollars because of an acceleration in interest rates and the fact that the average home has gone from 290,000 to 420. By the way, the most expensive homes in the world, based on this metric, are number three, Vancouver. Why? Because 60 percent of the cost of building a home goes to permits.  Because guess what, the incumbents that own assets have weaponized government to make it very difficult for new entrants to ever get their own assets, thereby elevating their own net worth. This is the transfer I'm going to be speaking about. (Applause) This has resulted in an enormous transfer of wealth, where people over the age of 70 used to control 19 percent of household income, versus people under the age of 40, used to control 12. Their wealth has been cut in half. This isn't by accident, it's purposeful.  This is me at UCLA in 1987. I know your first thought is I haven't changed a bit. (Laughter) This is also Mia Silverio, who is the analyst who put together these slides. By the way, Mia is 26. I did the math, just by virtue of her being in this audience, it brings the average age of the entire conference down 11 days. (Laughter) When I applied to UCLA, the admissions rate was 76 percent. Today, it's nine percent. I received a 2.23 GPA from UCLA. I learned nothing but how to make bongs out of household items  and every line from "Planet of the Apes." And the greatest public school in the world, Berkeley, decided to let me in with a 2.27 GPA. And that's what higher ed is about. Higher ed is about taking unremarkable kids and giving them a shot at being remarkable. (Applause) And every year it's gotten more expensive. Higher ed and homes and the ability -- not only is higher ed incredibly expensive, it's not accessible. Because me and my colleagues are drunk on luxury, and I'll come back to that. We've embraced the ultimate strategy.  Me and my colleagues in higher ed wake up every morning and ask ourselves the same question when we look in the mirror. How can I increase my compensation while reducing my accountability? (Laugter) And we have found the ultimate strategy. It's called an LVMH strategy, where we artificially constrain supply to create aspiration and scarcity such that we can raise tuition faster than inflation. And old people and wealthy people have done the same thing with housing. All of a sudden, once you own a home,  you become very concerned with traffic, and you make sure that there's no new housing permits. And here is a memo to my colleagues in higher ed: we’re public servants, not fucking Chanel bags. (Applause) Harvard is the best example of this. They've increased their endowment in the last 40 years and have decided to expand their enrollment, their freshman class, by four percent. Any university that doesn't grow their freshman class faster than population that has over a billion dollars in endowment  should lose their tax-free status because they're no longer in higher education. They're a hedge fund offering classes. (Cheers and applause) My first recommendation: Biden should take some of that 750 billion earmarked to bail out the one third of people that got to go to college on the backs of the two thirds that didn't and give a billion dollars to our 500 greatest public institutions, size-adjusted, in exchange for three things. One, they use technology and scale to reduce tuition by two percent a year,  expand enrollments by six percent a year and increase the number of vocational certifications and nontraditional four-year degrees by 20 percent. Where does that get us? In just ten years, in just ten years, that doubles the freshman seats and cuts the cost in half. This isn't radical. This is called college in the '80s and '90s. Another transfer of wealth. Look at what's happened to wages. Oh, they've gone up? Not as much as corporate profits. There's a healthy tension between capital and labor.  But for the last 40 years, capital has been kicking the shit out of labor. Well, you think, what about wages, right? They've gone up. Well if you compare them to the S and P, they barely register. It's been an amazing time to own assets. But your attempt to get the certification or the income such that you can acquire assets has gotten harder and harder. In my class of 300 kids, it's never been easier to be a billionaire, it's never been harder to be a millionaire. By the way, our job in higher ed  isn't to identify a top one percent of people who are freakishly remarkable or have rich parents and turn them into a super class of billionaires. It's to give the bottom 90 a chance to be in the top ten. (Applause) You know who doesn't need me or higher education? The top 10 percent. The whole point of higher ed is to give the unremarkables, i.e. yours truly, who was raised by a single immigrant mother, a shot of being remarkable. The transfer has been purposeful. While the cohorts, corporations and the ultra-wealthy  continue to garner more and more of our wealth, we have decided, "I know, if they win the gold, let’s give them the silver and the bronze, and let’s lower their taxes.” This transfer is purposeful. It’s not by accident, and it works. Senior poverty is way down, and we should celebrate that. Meanwhile, child poverty is flat to up. The third rail. I'm going to talk about Social Security. It would cost 11 billion dollars to expand the child tax credit. But that gets stripped out of the infrastructure bill.  But the additional 135 billion dollars a year to Social Security, that flies right through Congress. And every year we transfer 1.4 trillion dollars from a cohort that is increasingly doing less well to the cohort that is the wealthiest cohort in the history of this planet. I'm not against Social Security, but the criteria should be if you need it, not whether you have a catheter. 80 percent of you, 80 percent of you have absolutely no reason to ever take Social Security. It is bankrupting our nation.  And we have fallen under this mythology that somehow it's this great social program. No it's not. It's the great transfer of wealth from young to old. (Applause) How is this happening? Because our representatives are in fact, representative. Old people vote. Washington has become a cross between the "Land of the Dead" and "The Golden Girls." (Laughter) Quite frankly, this is fucking ridiculous. And if I sound ageist -- (Applause) If I sound ageist, I am. And you know who else is ageist? Biology.  (Laughter) When Speaker Pelosi had her first child, get this, two thirds of households didn't have color televisions, and Castro had just declared martial law. But she's supposed to understand the challenges of a 17-year-old girl who’s 5′ 9", 95 pounds, getting tips on dieting and extreme dieting from Facebook? She's supposed to understand the challenges that a 27-year-old single mother faces? By the way, young and dreamy. (Laughter) Young and dreamy. (Applause) The great intergenerational theft took place under the auspices of a virus.  I know, let's use the greatest health crisis in a century to really speed-ball the transfer. This is the Nasdaq from 2008 to 2012. We let the markets crash. And by the way, you need churn, you need disruption because it seeds and recalibrates advantage and wealth from the incumbents to the entrants. It's a natural part of the cycle. But wait, lately, no, a million people dying would be bad. But what would be tragic is if we let the Nasdaq go down and guys like me lost wealth. So we pumped the economy,  which again, increased the massive transfer of wealth. The best two years of my life? Covid -- more time with my kids, more time with Netflix, and the value of my stocks absolutely exploded. And who has to pay for my prosperity? Not me. Future generations who will have to deal with an unprecedented level of debt. Why am I here, and why do I get the prosperity I enjoy? Because in 2008 we bailed out the banks, but we didn't bail out the economy. We let the markets fall. So as I was coming into my prime income-earning years,  I got to buy, no joke, these stocks at these prices. This is where those stocks are now. Where does a young person find disruption? When you bail out the baby boomer owner of a restaurant, all you're doing is robbing opportunity from the 26-year-old graduate of a culinary academy that wants her shot. We need disruption. (Laughter) I just like this slide. It has no context or relevance. (Laughter and cheers) We're economically attacking the young, but I know, let's attack their emotional and mental well-being.  Let's take advantage of the flaws in our species with medieval institutions, Paleolithic instincts and godlike technology. I'm just going to say, I think Mark Zuckerberg has done more damage to the young people in our nation while making more money than any person in history. (Applause) Oh, but wait, it could be worse. It's as if we let an adversary implant a neural jack into our youth to raise a generation of civic, military and business leaders that hate America. How can we be this stupid? (Laughter)  This all adds up to a bunch of graphs all headed up into the right. And what are they? What's the first one? Oh, that's self-harm rates, which have exploded, especially among girls since my colleague Jonathan Haidt pointed out, it's really, really gone crazy since social went on mobile. What's the next one? Teens with depression. The next one, men and women not having sex. Biggest fear of my parents was that I was going to get in too much trouble. My biggest fear, honestly, is that my kids aren't going to get into enough trouble.  My advice to every young person watching this program is go out, drink more and make a series of bad decisions that might pay off. (Laughter and applause) Next graph, cumulative gun deaths. You're more likely to be shot in the United States if you're a toddler or an infant than a cop. Next graph, obesity, way up. By the way, the industrial food complex wants to addict you to shitty, fatty foods so they can hand you over to the industrial diabetes complex. We should not romanticize obesity. You're not finding your fucking truth.  You're finding diabetes. (Laughter and applause) Overdose deaths, way up. Deaths of despair. When I was in high school, it was drunk driving, now it's kids killing themselves. Young people don't want to have kids anymore. Two-thirds of people aged 30 to 34, able-bodied, used to decide to have at least one child. It's been cut in half. It's now less than a third, 27 percent. As a result, people over the age of 60 in the US, pretty happy. People under the age of 30, not so much. Some of the lowest in the free world.  What can we do? Nothing wrong with America that can't be fixed with what's right with it. We got the hard stuff figured out. There are programs to address all of these issues, they cost a lot of money, that's the hard part. And we have figured this out. In just five minutes post an earnings call, we can add a quarter of a trillion dollars to the economy. We've got the hard part figured out, the resources. We have the money, but we decide not to do it. This is per-capita spending on child care in the United States  relative to other nations. This is housing permits. Things are doable. We increase minimum wage at 25 bucks an hour, it goes into the economy. The wonderful things about low- and middle-income households is they spend all their money. We have to have or restore a progressive tax structure with alternative minimum tax on corporations and wealthy individuals. We need to refund the IRS. We need to reform Social Security. It should be based on whether you need the money, not on how old you are. We need a negative income tax.  My friend Andrew Yang screwed up a great idea, but he branded it incorrectly. Instead of calling it UBI, he should’ve got Republicans on board by calling it a negative income tax. (Laughter) We need to eliminate the capital gains tax deduction. When did we decide that the money that capital earns is more noble than the money that sweat earns? Shouldn't it be flipped? (Applause) We need to remove 230 protection for all algorithmically-elevated content. We need identity verification. The reason we can have identity verification  is because we have a First Amendment. Break up Big Tech. We have monopolies that are incurring greater and greater costs on every small business and parents because again, see above, our representatives don't understand these technologies. We need to age-gate social media. There's absolutely no reason anyone under the age of 16 should ever be on social media. (Applause) We need universal pre-K. We need to reinstate the expanded child-tax credit. We need term limits, see above, Andrew Yang. We need income-based affirmative action.  Any visible signs of affirmative action make no sense at all. You would rather be born gay or non-white, in the United States today than poor. And that's a sign of our progress and our need to recalibrate who we give advantage to. Affirmative action, of which I’m a beneficiary -- I got Pell Grants, I got unfair advantage -- affirmative action is a wonderful thing, and it should be based on color: it should be based on green. How much money you have or don't have. Expand college enrollment in vocational programs.  Mental health, ban phones in schools, invest in third places, Big Brothers and Sisters programs. We need national service. We need to tell people in the United States and Canada that they live in the greatest countries in the world, and we need to remind them of that every day by exposing them to other great Americans where they feel connective tissue. We can do all of this. We can do all of it. We have the resources. The question is, do we have the will? This is my last slide. It is an emotionally manipulative slide to try and get you to like me more.  (Laughter) But it does have a message. This is the whole shooting match. Anybody here without kids, ask someone with kids. You have your world of work, you have your world of friends, you have your world of kids. Something happens here, your whole world shrinks to this. (Applause) So I present, as I wrap here, with just a few questions. One, if you acknowledge that our kids are the most important thing in our lives, that everything else we do here is meaningful, but our kids' well-being and prosperity is profound.  If you acknowledge that they're doing more poorly than previous generations. If you believe there’s a chance that the illusion of complexity has done nothing but provide cloud cover for the unbelievable transfer of good will, of well-being and of prosperity from young to old. And if you believe we can actually fix these problems and we have the resources, then I present to you, I posit, I augur the question that I hope has more veracity than it did 17 minutes and 24 seconds ago. And that's the following question.  Do we love our children? My name is Scott Galloway, I teach at NYU, and I appreciate your time. (Cheers and applause) Thank you. (Applause) 	Center			Center	157

M325	https://youtu.be/fjMDQntBRG4?si=lenokUvik55Bqpbe	my name's uh Russell Hearn I'm from uh wman County West Virginia uh just here recently about four years ago I found about my story uh you know my grandparents uh had 13 daughters and seven sons uh you were raised by your grandparents uh no I was raised by my mom which uh uh one of the 13 daughters uh it was be my grandma of the way I was raised but be actually my sister and uh but uh anyways uh the S the son which had by had slept with my grandmother which would be my mother and she had me and that's how you get  seventh of the Seventh Son how many kids were there uh there was seven sons and 13 daughters uh the 21st child was a miscarriage and they adopted a daughter named bookie and then I was born uh which be a 2 second child so your mom my mom would be actually my first cousin but you know why I was raised I was raised like as a lie one told me I was raised by she was my mom because I found uh the the guy on my birth certificate my dad they spell his name a TN but it's like when I was born they put a a in there like Alpha Hearns yeah  Hearns a a r yeah uh and see uh he you're saying he was your brother no he he was by the way was was raised he was my dad he was on my first uh you see when I was born uh I hadn't been named to like like my my mother died give birth to me and they hadn't named me yet and um and then uh I re my mom the one that stepped up to raise me uh she wasn't married yet and then when she married my dad by the way I was raised I then you know he sign my birth certificate and you know like I said I I I just come to knowledge for  this like four years ago you just found out yes this is here you raised here in Wyoming County yes West Virginia I've been here my whole life uh since uh the day I was born was uh when I was born I was in the hospital until I was 3 years old why is that uh just I was my stomach they had I had to drink goats milk in class five and they had to bring goats milk into me I I I was able to drink no cows milk nothing dairy uh no baby formula or nothing like that it's just like when it rains it pours yeah no kidding  knowz about the same time uh you know I lost my home for fire uh my wife Left Me 2 months later then you know it's like really ain't much around here I've been at a struggle trying to get up back on my feet how old how old are you now I'm 40 now you're 40 yes sir and you the way you grow up I mean a lot of people here you know living in poverty you guys were pretty poor as well yeah yes sir there so many kids yes sir uh and you know uh you know everybody worked but you know my grandfather like agriculturally uh he grew Farm uh he  sold uh like vegetables and stuff like that and you know until uh you know technology come up and you know the family work which I've always worked and had a steady job and until you know I lost everything and uh I'm just trying to gradually get back on my feet what kind of work have you done uh I went to school got my bachelor's degree well technology well yes sir uh I've been in the labor union for uh I'm still I still got my seat there 15 years I've done work for Army Corps of Engineers uh built DS and bridges and uh  schools and Co mining never uh I've done coal mining uh I started working when I was a junor in High School uh it started out like security work uh got I was school Friday worked all weekend and then that got old uh but which uh my stepdad I grew up with raising me um he worked day shift and second shift job come up and when I got out of school um soon I got school I went to work and then uh and then got off 11 but then you know I work for them until I graduated high school and they paid for my minor  card and stuff I working ground from that uh and then that uh I got out of that and um I went to work in DC for a while Washington DC doing the fire suppression systems so you so you have left West Virginia yes uh trying to better myself and uh you know better work and more higher paying job uh I've done that for a while about four or five years um then when I come back home um like August of 2008 is when I got in labor J and I've been working there ever since uh but ever since I lost my home the fire and  my you know my wife left me two minutes later uh I just been uh in depression you know what I mean until you know I met my girlfriend Britney and she's been a lot of help I I'm blessed to be here really you stayed away from drugs or drugs been part of your life you know drugs was in early part of my life uh and then I got out of that cuz I started having kids I got two sons and one daughter and uh where are they today well they're with their M well I got two sons by my first wife and and a daughter  by my second wife I've been married twice uh they're they're with their mommy their mommy got cust of them uh but which when my wife left with my daughter uh you know she took my daughter with her she had temporary custody and just like uh you know but they they let me see him you know when I when I can get way to see him and I talk to him on a reg bases on phone and stuff still try to be a part of my child's life what's been your experience with this growing up in this part of the country where it's where everyone is  struggling to survive it it it is poverty uh uh the drugs uh is a big uh thing and people stealing and and and it's sad you know um my mom always say my kids Wen perfect but uh we we had manners and you know we're supposed to love our neighbor as ourselves and and as a as a community we're not supposed to steal off each other nobody we're supposed to help one another and you know only time we're supposed to look down someone we reach our hand out to help them but it's like anymore it's like oh I got this and you don't and  everybody's like jealous and uh and haters and which I know we'll have at you know throughout our life what's been your bigest regret uh H drugs you know uh drugs didn't help man and you know I hoping I could have got you know got out of here really you would have rather you had left West Virginia yeah some you know be somewhere else to better myself because at we right here now I mean it's 45 minutes an hour to get anything I mean we we got a convenience store but uh for any any kind of type of job you got to  travel uh and ain't much nothing here for people West Virginia's a retirement State anymore unless you're a CO Miner seems to be so rough for so many people it is uh I mean uh it's a it's a I don't like to say it's a struggle every day but if if everyone would get on the same page and and work together it would I my opinion it wouldn't be like that you know no one should be going hungry did your family ever take you anywhere when you were a kid to see other parts of the country oh yeah you know I had a  great childhood uh you know we went to the beach uh you know our old man worked all time so the mom and uh so we can have a childhood you know we we didn't have Nikes and a lot of stuff growing up but uh we de we go to be kids and uh and I'm very grateful for that cuz there not a lot of people did and you know it's like after we graduated high school and stuff when Mom worked she still always kept Place R in case one of us kids need a place to go to so your mom's relationship with your dad is what uh well by that they they had been  divorced since I was 5 years old okay but but they were uh genetically they were well oh the way my mom and dad was uh well my dad you know being my brother and my mom being my grandmother uh you know um which I never got to meet neither none of them cuz it's like my mother died giv birth to me and my father died at the age of 38 so I never left to meet NE one of them you need a scorecard you keep track of your whole family yeah it is and you know find out about this and I tell people they're like what are youing I  said I know by the way I was raised I do have a mom and dad but it was like to to you they were your mom and dad yeah but it but kep for me secretly uh you know my brother was my dad and my grandmother was my mother and and we come out to find out about it I mean it's startling I wish start a new sooner they were still your parents no matter what yes no matter what you I mean we have a mom and dad but we also have a mother and father see cuz my mom my mom's uh way her dad was uh her that was which I  called them my grandparents my grand my grandfather was D they lived in Clay County of big U up and they had seven sons and uh and then by the man on my birthday to get my dad uh they had 13 they had 13 siblings Seven Daughters and and six Sons it comes out like 20 20 daughters and 20 Sons throughout the family well like six different Grandma and Grandpa uh but they come from 13 sisters and seven sons as a as a big family what do you think people outside of West Virginia outside of this really poor part of West Virginia don't  understand about it uh to tr extent I understand you know uh well genetically uh like I said like they say father sler daughters Sons sler mothers uh but back then like they keep the fly and not have nobody El as my opinion really did it but they call it inbreeding or incest but in the animal world they call it thbr you know with horses and dogs that's how you get that's how you keep a bloodline tight and and and and see uh brothers and sisters ain't supposed to sleep together that's that that's how  you get uh special needs of people uh genetically get uh the only thing I would know people say it's TV but like the BL G uh brother and sister done that uh like the Dutchman genetically that brother and sister they they done it and but that's only family is able to do it they didn't have a choice I mean when you're alone and you're the only two there at a young age and you really don't know if that's your sister or brother and you fall in love love is a strong power and and you can't help who you  love and and you know people knock that and and to a certain you know understand what being against all and stuff because uh deformity if uh humans don't it makes it special in need people with such a large family were there other no that that's the only ones you mean I know of and teally everybody come out uh okay yeah I mean you know by now I probably got two 300 second cousins and W a big family and you know by around here my grandfather's same this a a Lester a there was like four or five different families with different ler  you know different ler but my opinion genetically probably still the same family but see my grandfather uh they like ger Italian come up here my grandmother was B an Indian and I asked somebody one time you know on a on a regular letter on a on a dog how many of their PS they have cuz you know you have 20 20 kids you know I mean grandma grandpa was busy uh but you know I wouldn't change it you know I mean are you glad you grew up here in West vir yes I'm very glad certainly beautiful uh you know what I  mean uh I I've been around the city life and stuff like this and uh but being in the country you you uh respect the meaning of a dollar you know what I mean like just you learn um not to be Gable and Buton uh you learn how to spread it out when you ain't got it and you know exhaust what would you like to do with your life now you're still a young man yes you know I I was want to travel see the country uh like I've been from Jersey down the southeast uh see the world but I I like to be able to go  somewhere and better my you know put my education education use

find a job and and better myself and and get get back up on my feet and it's been a struggle but you know I've had help I'm very blessed for that is it is it difficult right now at this point of your life to to get up the money to maybe move or do anything like  that you have kids that are still I met my kids are with the mom uh just being able to get somewhere I can settle in to be able to get opportunity to be able to go yeah but you don't you don't want to move to Charlotte or Atlanta or something like that because your kids are still here right no I mean if they was taken care of by their mom and stuff you know I would do all me necessary to better I I got to better myself and think of myself and and and and take care of myself and make myself happy and  get myself back up the

means to be able to take care of them yeah and you know that's what we to North Carolina to try to do but uh it's just I some people just some people's rude and think about theel and and we're not supposed to be like that and uh are are you religious yeah I Pentecostal uh our family had our own  church and it's like uh like every month we'd go down to Grundy and have a family dinner and uh have church service more or less like an all day service uh but yeah Pentecostal mhm just taking time is that right yes sir what was church like you know it was uh well for me like uh like with the snake handlers and all that kind of stuff well see I having 13 sisters uh some of them sisters believe you're not married into second count prach like d County like Jolo I've been to that and you know their belief was uh you know  faithful believe in God that God wouldn't let them um get bit but I look at it a different way I'm not going to Temp Nature by no means uh but um but it seems like every time the preacher get to preaching it always put me to sleep like a all by and I try not to do that but just it's just how it is and I'm still like that and me and my girlfriend we sat down and read our Bible thoroughly a couple days a week and and we pray for living Our God always and our Lord what's your favorite thing about living  here uh the country yeah you know I mean the scenery is very nice

M332	https://youtu.be/huvStjScFvM?si=0igfmxqDcCjIHox9	well hey B it's Jamie D me here welcome back to the channel honey listen I want to get into some things and what I want to talk about is this teacher over on Tik Tok who has his students taking down his braids I guess he has a hair appointment of some sort and I want to get into it um I've been saying it swarm all around social media but I have not actually gotten a chance to really check it out wholeheartedly so we're about to do that together okay make sure that you guys are indeed coming into the video  you are liking up the channel okay subscribing to the channel as well if you're not subscribed and make sure that you're cutting on your notification Bells okay so without further Ado let us go ahead and hop into this video to see exactly what uh this teacher has to say about this um let's check it out stream my students helping me take my hair out there was quite the discourse in the chat which had people saying this was inappropriate and other people saying this was completely fine there was nothing wrong with what I was doing and  people were just making it weird so of course I had to bring this issue to the big stage I would like to represent myself in this case your honor if I may number one for little context I had a hair appointment immediately after school and I needed my hair taken out beforehand I would have taken it out the night before but that Friday we had a camera crew coming in to shoot a promotional video and I was one of the ones being interviewed so I had to look presentable so I didn't take my hair out I didn't have the time to do it  all myself cuz it would have taken me forever so naturally I asked about four or five of my over over a 100 best friends to assist me in taking my hair out and they all agreed number two this was at the end of class this week we were doing stem fair presentations since it was Friday and all of my students did an excellent job on their stem fair projects and presentations I told them if we get one solid presentation in this class I'll end class a little early and they can have fun and play basketball  darts or be on their phones or whatever and during that time my team would help me take my hair out a couple of these were students from my class but others were students from other classes I would all of them a pass at the beginning of the class period requesting their assistance 10 minutes before dismissal I told the teachers only send them if all of their work was completed and they had good behavior they all met the criteria so 10 minutes before dismissal they showed up for their job my next point I  like to make is if I was a female teacher those people wouldn't be in the comments saying oh this is weird this is inappropriate cuz me personally I don't think there's anything weird about this people are saying oh that's too intimate to me it's literally just hair it doesn't have to be weird some people have never had cool teachers in the shows I personally believe that building authentic relationships with students is Paramount in being an Effective Teacher I make sure my students know and can  feel that I care about them beyond the schoolwork and all the stuff that I have to make them do I take the time to get to know my students outside of academics because caring for the whole child is what's important some of these students have been with me since I was was a substitute 4 years ago they see me as a big brother or a father figure as some of them say and me I don't want kids of my own so all of these kids are literally my children and in case you're wondering about their parents most of  them follow me on social media and always talk about my videos with their kids they always tell me that they're so grateful that their kids have someone like me in their life and my admin they're well aware of my social media presence and they love my videos to me this is just another wholesome moment that I'm having with my kids that I was fortunate enough to catch on film since I'm a science teacher one thing that I teach my students about is symbiosis symbiosis deals with the relationships between organisms the type of  relationship that I like to Foster in my class is mutualism or mutualistic relationship which means both organisms benefit from The Exchange so when my students have good behavior complete all their assignments and do everything that a scholar is supposed to do I reward them with downtime and just time to just be a kid be on their phones play games gossip so on and so forth my students and I work hard and we play harder I'm fortunate enough to have students that feel safe and comfortable around me safe  to come to me with their problems their frustrations they come to me seeking guidance and wisdom or come to me simply to chill and hang out because they know that they have a safe space to be themselves around me what I strive to do as an educator is be the teacher I wish I had grown up I strive to be the teacher that makes my inner child happy someone that my inner child would be proud of I want to be the teacher that my students reflect back on 20 30 years down the line and think like dang that  teacher I had in middle school he was the no further questions your honor so let me know your thoughts in the comments you think this was inappropriate or people are making something out of nothing and although you are entitled to your opinion all I ask is that you be resp respectful thank you all right so y'all just got a chance to check out that video and you know when I first saw it um my initial thought was like oh this is so inappropriate like what the hell does he think he doing and you know after I  listened to this video just now um nothing has changed I still feel the same goddamn way I felt the first time you could play however much classical music you want to play and talk as soft as you want to talk but in my personal this is uh inappropriate um I feel like everything that he said he was on point with um you know the relationships between students and teachers but then also when you allow students to get this comfortable in spaces it could lead to inappropriate behavior or misunderstandings of some sort um in my  personal and you know he talks about you know I feel like a lot of you people may have never had a cool teacher and I understand that but then at the same time a lot of people have had cool teachers in the school and a lot of times not all but quite a bit of the times those cool teachers have been caught up in rumors of them doing inappropriate things with students so why would you want to put yourself in a position for that to possibly happen where somebody could put these allegations out there on you and then  some of the videos like this they use against you in court at some point you know what I'm saying um and you know how one would set it up you know in court or whatever they can all easily turn a simple video as a lot of people may view it like this one into something that's extremely like salacious or whatever we see it all the time with media but um yeah I I I'm just I understood what he was saying and it was really the soft classical music and you listening and it's like okay I see what you're saying but no my dog  like that's still inappropriate um to me I just can't and I'm not going to let my child take nobody hair down especially a stranger if you ain't going to pay like run my kid their coins what this supposed to be for extra credit or some something or something like what is we why what was the purpose of even filming this and putting this off on social media and see the other thing for me is it's the students identity what if I'm a parent who don't post my child on social media and what if I'm trying to you know  conceal the school that my child goes to and you're over here putting them on display on social media like I kind of feel way about that you know even though he tried to you know answer that too and say most of my students or some of my students parents know that I put them on social media yeah I hear you say that but do we know that those children's parents know that you put them on social media you see what I'm saying um I probably would have felt the way if I would have saw that video and that was  my child in the video like what the like explain this situ why you got my child taking your hair down like what is that about you ain't give me no call ahead of time I understand it was like at the last few minutes of class and these are some of the good students some of my best students are the ones that I had come and they were so great in school they were so fantastic that I chose them to take my hair down like m I feel like that's still giving a bit of tacky in my personal I do feel like um  in my personal it was just it was inappropriate I understand that you're on crunch time and I understand that you have a hair appointment and things that you need to get done but I also feel like you should have did it yourself okay I hate to say it like I mean or just pay a five pay the five if you can afford to pay the five pay the five and just have somebody just had a person take your hair down on you get there to get your hair done you know um it did you know as I I mean to me it did kind of look a bit innocent as  I'm watching and I'm listening to him talk you know um but at the same time as innocent as it may have seem with the young ladies taking the hair down it still seemed a bit inappropriate especially for you to want to film it for social media and put them on display like that's my biggest thing like what if somebody's trying not to let everybody know what school they child attends and you got they ass all on social media like did you get clearance for that was there a letter that sent that was sent home for the parents that  was an approval of oh hey um can we get your permission you know sometimes what we like to do is we like to film um you know Tik toks and just want to get your approval that it's okay for your child to be filmed on Tik Tok like I ain't like that um and then another thing he said that a lot of my students see me as a big brother this that that and the other um that's a lot that's not all you don't know how those kids may see you you know a lot of times I do feel like you have older people teachers and stuff  who are just trying to be kind to you know the students or whatnot and they may take that kindness in a different type of way it's been plenty of times I know when I was in school around their age I would hear some of my friends and others have a crush on one of the handsome teachers in school or whatever not that the teacher will ever cross the line with them but you know doing little stuff like this make them feel like oh I probably got a chance or whatever ain't no telling what's going on with these  people heads so in these in these kids heads I just feel like when it's a situation like this in my personal I just um let's lower these type of conversations from happening by not engaging in this type of stuff I mean you know that's just like I just I don't know y'all I I mean I understand how people want to water it down and say oh you know it's just hair it's really not that big of a deal like it's not that deep but as soon as y'all come out with something soon as something happen or pop off y'all will be using this very  video as a reference to explain said person's poor Behavior you know what I'm saying like y'all should have known when y'all saw this D if this man got caught up in some stuff in the past or anything in the future this is going to be a video used to reference any allegations like you know and then I feel like I know you're trying to be you know a great person to these students a teacher that cares about them outside of school and all of that and I get that and I do think we need teachers like that but at  the same time I feel like if you're if you got them taking your hair down in class what other things do you have them doing that makes them feel a bit too comfortable to where if it came down to a situation of getting themselves or or you out of trouble they'll like they may just throw some allegations out there on you and then now you're having to defend yourself like I just yeah I can't let it fly for me you know I mean but if that's what everybody else feels and that's how y'all Rock like it's not that deep it's just hair  and if you people that are saying it's just hair have children and you feel like you'll be okay with then cool um if you're a person that probably don't have no kids and you looking at it like hey you know um I think nothing's wrong with that well then maybe when you have your child you might feel the same or you might feel differently I know me as a parent I don't want no like that okay I don't want my child taking your hair down okay I feel like you can be a friend to a student and also have clear  clear lines for them to know that I'm your teacher okay don't get too friendly with me think you going to come over here and take my hair down or none of that like it's a way to be cool and then it's also a way to you know draw the line just like you know as being a parent knowing that you are you know in a position of authority but also at the same time like not being too um I guess uh I don't want to say harsh but harsh of a lack of lack of better word not being too distant with your kid that  they can't have honest conversations with you and all of that so it's just like really I I just I for me as a parent I would not want my child taking down a teacher's hair uh male or female okay um son or daughter meaning teacher meaning whether the teacher is a woman whether the teacher is a man whether my child is a girl but what I don't want them participating in that and I damn sure don't want nobody putting my child on social media as you're sitting there what it looks like your School logo on  it so people know like I mean I think that's my biggest issue and that's crazy because it's really bigger than them taking down the hair in a sense it's like like how you know these parents really want their child on camera and then it being on display where they child go to school at like I don't know I don't really like this but I'm going let y'all do what y'all want to do cuz y'all going to do it do that anyway cuz how y'all is hello but y'all leave y thoughts in comments down below and let me know whether you felt like it was  that big of a deal whether you felt like it wasn't a big that big of a deal and keep in mind this my personal my personal ain't your personal okay and that's okay don't be trying to attack me girl for my personal cuz I don't see stuff the way that you do understand and I'm probably never going to see it the same way but that's just where we at all right so you guys leave your thoughts and comments down below I'm Jamie that's me uh follow me on Instagram and Twitter at Jamie that's me and I will catch you  guys in the next one bye-bye my city

out of Florida now you may think it's all sunshine and smiles because many think that Florida is an idealic place but there's also a dangerous and dark side to Florida and some people who have chosen to live here are finding out only the hard way that moving to Florida has changed a lot so today I'm here on location and I'm going to give you the full tour so that you can avoid the  pitfalls that are costly so give me a thumbs up if you're good with that now every day unsuspecting buyers are buying homes here in Florida now many of them have massive regret only because they just did not know today as a buyer you need to be realistic about what things are going to actually cost because it's bad enough that some of these people have overpaid but now some people are getting completely wiped out so here's the truth and it comes directly from people who have gotten Fed Up and they've moved out of state now this is  the truth about what's really happening in Florida now warned this may not be what you want to hear but I'm going to show you 11 Florida money trap issues and here they are in descending order number 11 now man you're saying that Florida has become too Hardy and pompous they keep telling me suddenly the rich and the entitled are moving in and taking over with attitude and I get it now some of you have told me that you're sick and tired of them looking down there snot at you and that's really sad  to hear because this is spreading to more parts of Florida in places that used to be super laidback you can see what's happening there's a lot of money that's moving in from outside the state with this rude sense of entitlement number 10 hurricanes tropical storms and lightning strikes that equals High insurance cost increases today Florida insurance companies are saying rates could increase by 40% by 2025 it's happening even a year and a half after the storm you've been paying those sky- High insurance insurance rates and even if  you file a claim go ahead and try collecting number eight Florida accounts for 79% of all the insurance lawsuits in the United States while the other 51 states account for 21% why is this well Florida hurricanes are nothing new guys take a look at these numbers think about the states that hurricanes hit the most often now look at South Carolina for example which has 75% fewer hurricanes and that makes a huge difference in the actual cost of living and a more relaxed lifestyle this is not just the news headlines guys some  of you are written me and you shared the truth about how much you're overpaying for these ridiculous bills now one retired couple they told me their insurance bill was $3800 a year and now it's $9,000 a year and another lady said her insurance was $500 a year and now it's $19,500 a year now the problem with Florida insurance is there's no cap so can you imagine what this is going to look like in 5 or 10 years now if you've been affected by this go ahead and put it in the comments number seven just  know that since Florida is the number one state in the nation for hurricanes this affects the entire State of Florida not just the coast of Florida now this may not be what you want to hear but it's the truth Citizens insurance is the insur of Last Resort but it's now the largest insur in the State of Florida and now they'll require you to pay for additional flood insurance policies even if you're not in a flood zone Financial ruin from floods or financial ruin from additional High insurance premiums I  don't know what do you think put it in the comments number six do you even need insurance I mean sure some people do have Buu Buck this isn't affecting them in any kind of way but if there's any kind of a mortgage that you're going to have on your property usually the mortgage company is going to require homeowners insurance as part of the mortgage terms to get financing now these policies must include a minimum basic policy which includes the house itself and the contents inside the house look even if you're loaded with money  and you pay cash as we've seen recently you could have a total loss of your investment and you're going to write a check for that demolition of your house and then when you rebuild you're going to have 100% of that cost coming out of your pocket as well you'll have an empty lot and you'll start over now many people even if they consider themselves rich don't want to take on that much risk considering the odds that are happening in Florida nowadays it's the average citizen that's fed up and just  can't do this anymore but it's not just the insurance it's the other tremendous costs of owning that are actually blindsiding many unsuspecting home buyers number five roof replacement costs are Sky High and they're only going higher now look one woman she told me that replacing her three-bedroom two bath house roof was 42 ,000 it's really happening in most other states you'll see that asphalt shingles they'll last 15 or 20 years but metal roofs they'll last even longer but Florida with its blistering heat repeated storms winds  hail it's hard to get that much time out of a roof I mean even after a storm the big issue is trying to get an honest roof contractor to show up without ripping your nose off now one gentleman told me he got a quote for his new house after a storm and it was 73,000 that's in Central Florida guys not on the coast he's now sold that Florida house and has moved to South Carolina number four property taxes I mean with Florida's explosion in home values over the last few years these tax appraisers are having a field day with this now if  you bought back in the 80s or the '90s you're already grandfathered in so it's not a big deal but today if you're buying it's a totally different story so you'll be getting the new higher reassessed values and back in 2015 this property sold for $441 current owners are grandfathered in at the old tax rates they're paying $133,000 a year in taxes now it's for sale for 2,739 th000 now think about what happens when you get a property tax value to the tax assessor at that new sale price now back in 2011 these owners bought this  property for $455,000 and since it's grandfathered in tax assessor has that property valued at 500,000 the owner pays $1,367 a year in taxes now when everything changes again because that property is for sale for 1 million the Trap is that many new unsuspecting home buyers will get that welcome to Florida slap when they get their updated tax bill from the assessor so I've got a question for you with the influx of all these new people in Florida and they're raising the taxes where's all this money  going number three the Florida wamy now one of our clients they moved out of Florida just because her combined property tax and insurance bills were $25,000 a year she moved to Myrtle Beach South Carolina and is now living on a golf course Community just 7 miles from the beach her property tax and her insurance combined are a total of $3,800 she's using the $21,000 a year in savings to invest to travel to have fun and to have a relaxed life now if you think Florida's costs are out of control you're going to love the  traffic number two now many of you are saying Florida is too crowded and Florida has changed a lot the wait in long lines at any kind of a store or the wait months to get a doctor's appointment or the traffic that just creeps along crazy slow when you fight to find a parking space and many of you have written me and you told me that Florida used to be fun and relaxed but now you're telling me that Florida has lowered your quality of life and if you're retired this time is important number one all kinds of insurance in  Florida is skyrocketing now if you didn't already know this Florida car insurance it is nuts look if you cut all your expenses your coverage limits and you double your deductible you're still going to pay through the nose you want to know why well in Florida there's a high number of super slow moving drivers and you couple that with with some crazy high-speed weaving in and out traffic cars are getting flooded out and a higher percentage of cars are stolen hey this leads to making Florida car insurance one of the highest in the  nation it's happening rain the marketing tells us that Florida is the Sunshine State but it also gets 56 in of rain every single year so if you live in a flat state where does all that water go watch out for flooding you will also see 1.2 million Cloud to ground round lightning strikes each year no other state experiences more lightning strikes per square mile than Florida Florida gets a lot of publicity about the 730,000 people who moved to the state but what they don't tell you is about the other 500,000 people who left so  even though Florida has a positive net migration there is a reason why many people are leaving the state there are many who originally thought they were going to move to Florida but now they're having second thoughts and they're choosing alternative areas to live with lower property taxes places with lower insurance rates and places that still have mild year- round weather a lower cost of living and still a great Beach lifestyle over the last 20 years my real estate team has helped thousands of  people move to those areas and they can still vacation in Florida because

feet okay um so Nick are you here yes okay so guys we got to go over these uh Boogie allegations this is this is insane all right this popped up on the lcal Reddit uh let me just read it to you uh it says my experience with boogie2988 hey Reddit I've been  struggling uh with something for a while now uh I finally found the will to express it it's about an experience I had with Steven meaning Boogie of course for privacy reasons I won't disclose my face or name but I feel it's important to speak up up especially for Desi sake which is uh Boogie uh child bride uh I came prot I came across Boogie uh Discord name uh after a live show uh accident by keemstar it was the real boogie 2988 I understand sharing this could appear to be a breach of privacy but I need to  provide the background to show that I'm not lying I sent him a friend request on Discord without thinking about it to my disbelief he added me back a few weeks later and we began chatting our conversation lasted about a month and for the most part it was casual and enjoyable however towards the end Stephen AKA Boogie asked me for something that made me feel uncomfortable when I said this made me feel uncomfortable he quickly ended the call following that he unfriended me on Discord and we haven't spoke since I  want to be clear I have no hate for buggy I have lots of respect for his work what work he want even Mo his lawn and and looked up to him prior uh but I couldn't shake off the feeling of guilt for keeping this secret especially when it comes to Desi uh and she has a right to know I'm going to disclose this complete chat history for the record I an adult woman okay so well obviously obviously I was very upset with her for not showing we her giant black feet um she's an adult I was going to give her nine dolls  to show me her giant black feet and she wouldn't do it and I'm just it's very heartbreaking to me let's get let's get into the Vlogs because first of all I understand that you're trying to be sarcastic like you're innocent and this is all fake and everything buggy I get it but we have the top ape expert on the show Nicholas diorio if you guys watch his YouTube channel he covers nothing but all the time y yep all right so let's get into these DMS it looks like on March 22nd of 2024 uh this individual  said hey buggy I just want to let you know that I'm a huge fan of both you and the show keep shining you respond by saying hey there I appreciate that I'm glad you're enjoying the show are these real real DMS no obviously not no you didn't tell a fan uh that you uh appreciate them and glad they're enjoying the show I mean that much could be real but this didn't actually happen but that that's the kind of thing I would say but keep reading you'll see things that I would obviously never okay uh the person says I can't believe  you actually replied I honestly didn't expect it and now I'm kind of freaking out Boogie responds if anyone should be nervous it's me it's not every day that I get to talk to a pretty girl at least I assume that's you and your profile picture now did you say that no obviously not I've been talking to pretty girl since 1995 I used to work in the porn industry I'm pretty numb to attractive women at this point you've seen the women that I've been out with you you know go ahead W the whole the whole thing right here is I was I met  Boogie at the um at the fight and there was like this press conference at the fight yeah and Boogie basically walked around with like a $100 bill in his hand and told every woman in the room that she's the most beautiful woman he's ever seen in his life he's right about except for the $100 bill part that ain't real but yes yes that's that's the only thing that's keeping me believing like all this has some level of credence to it is because the guy who's creating you or recreating you is doing such a good job  because you have zero real life game oh my God are you kidding me I would never in my life this is the worst game you could have if anyone should be nervous it's me that's no no woman has ever responded positively to that now ni I'm a small Bean you tried it before no I mean probably as a teenager but not as an adult Nick can you guess who's talking like right before buggy was speaking do you know who that is what do you mean Wings oh that yeah okay so you recognized his voice well it seems like  he lost it but yeah it's definitely Wings the southern draw no I don't think these messages are real because Boogie hasn't talked about killing himself once yet yeah that's true that's that is normally how I trauma Bond I'm like are you a suicidal if so we might kill each other together but first let me see your giant black feet Boogie our was it we had two interactions and our second one was if I shoot this guy on my lawn you have to avenge Me by defending me on YouTube yeah I was hoping you would man  yeah uh break we can talk about we can talk about that a little bit later if you want by the way breaking we have a big Dono uh $50 crazy how Keem can make sock accounts for this Force drama thread but uh brother will still get uh an un banon I I definitely forced uh for all this all right well let's continue with this what else is being said in here um uh uh the person says no thank you it's so nice of you to say yes it's me it's a rather old picture uh this is moving all the way up to April 4th I  love to see what you look like now uh the woman says boogie are you flirting with me you respond maybe me and you no uh uh maybe wait wait what the maybe me and you know I've been having problems it would be nice to have someone to talk to um it goes on to say what problems what I mean mental health problems but like what problems was having on on 404 that they would for okay well buggy have you went to your DMs on Discord to see if you were talking to any fans yeah I don't I don't use Discord so that's easy I don't use  Discord so you're saying that no matter what none of this is real not even one of these images is real I don't ask Tommy Tommy had to teach me to use use Discord I don't use disc I did have to teach you but that doesn't mean you don't talk to anybody let's be honest have you put on word to get this girl on the podcast yet have you like said if she wanted to come on and talk about it uh no uh I don't know how to reach uh I guess you can reach people you hardess to find if this is a girl yeah they Ed a  um a sock puppet account like a throwaway account or something right it's eastern D Blackberry 77 so this is just like a TR this is like beginning grade school troll up you know but then even if you look at these comment sections like number one this is not how I talk to a woman this is also not how I talk to anybody secondly when you look at the comment section they're like though you can clearly see these images are doctored and stuff like that but get keep going because this gets really good  I I I really this is hilarious so keep going well it it gets to the point where you make a phone call with this individual right sure um and uh after the phone call uh the person says hey sorry I was on my laptop I'm free now though um you respond by saying hey I can't talk but I uh but I can hear you uh because I'm not alone right now how are you can you turn your camera on you look very nice do you want to masturbate for me sure later is fine I like your socks I bet they're comfy God I bet your  feet smell nice can you take your socks off beautiful I would like to lick them can you call me worthless would you piss all over me and this is supposed to be a black woman right there was something about that in here when I scanned it uh yeah oh yeah I I I'm sure you already know but I love black worlds I've never told anyone this but back when I was single I paid two black women to dominate me and half SE the last thing I want in the world is to be dominated yeah that's the opposite of what I'm into um and uh aru  also the feet thing let me be honest the feet thing does not make sense to me what any feet men that are out there what do you do to the feet do you put them in you do you do you suck on what do you do to the feet I don't understand why you're attracted to feet yeah that's gross it doesn't make any sense to me I once I once saw don't make sense your argument so everything your entire argument I'm not saying this is true with you but your entire argument is this isn't true because I would never do  that there's no way to prove that one way or another you know like that's what everybody say I I never talk to a good girl like no I would never do that well prove you would never do that you can't prove it I mean at the end of the day anybody could accuse me of anything and it's going to stick sure right fair enough but you sound like somebody who's guilty what how do you see those swings you think he's innocent do you think he's guilty I think I think he's innocent personally because like he's been under the tire so long  get the Sling Blade you put gas in it I feel so bad I told Wings if he doesn't show up he's getting ConEd and like like you're you're pretty sick Bud you're pretty goddamn sick I'm also H per methazine and ail so like I'm I'm loopy great well thank you for showing up I will say um I have my person and I don't really feel the need for anything else um I don't think there'll ever be an opportunity that I'll ever seek another person I certainly wouldn't want to hurt myself or Desi that way like destroy  what we have or hurt her or anything like that uh but beyond that this just not something I would seek out I don't really enjoy online interactions I like never watched Desi masturbate on camera that's not I clearly I've always been an in real life person I paid for in real life interactions I don't pay for online interactions that doesn't make you never paid for porn in your life I paid for I I paid for porn but I haven't paid for like oh get on live camera and let me see your butthole like that that does  not appeal to me at all live show you said you life guy so I was wondering well have you ever I don't know got a brazer subscription or bought an only fans thing or anything like that no it went when I wanted to spend my money on women I would spend them on having interactions with women going out with women hanging out with women I did the sugaring thing no no hold on hold on hold on I swear to God when the whole internet was like super Lefty and like Pro sex worker you you were a subscriber to a bunch of  girls only fans I swear that's a thing how do I how am I remembering this this is from something I so I think I checked out a few in 2020 just to see what like what people are doing on an only fans and I had every intention of starting my own which I did I mean I have one go check it out it's all shirtless photos nothing worse than you'll see on my timeline anyway but um I wanted to learn the ins and outs of only fans and I did check out the website and figure all that out but I've always been Pro sex work my mom  did Sex work right I'm I'm 110 I've always been 110% Pro sex work didn't she didn't she do it on want to go against your mom the only way this story gets better if Boogie is the is the result of her sexi no no I'm not Charlie Kelly from always son okay time out we got two announcements one we have a poll going on is Boogie guilty currently 60% of the audience thinks that Boogie is in fact guilty plus we have a $50 Dono saying Boogie talk to me like this in DMs I have a lot of empathy for poor victims  that had to deal with this mad man oh God cuz I was not there too uh uh I'm not black and he didn't ask for a fee uh one for me one for the hooker I was the hooker I was the hooker yeah yeah I did it you're just your argument I wouldn't like I wouldn't do that it's not an argument it's not even a defense give me a defense how do I prove how what what would be that you probably have to take a screenshot of your uh and it wouldn't be be circumstantially yeah can't you delete your discords and stuff  yeah would wait so boie it would be better than what you're doing did you sound I can I can screen share if you want to see my screen though uh yeah do that and while you're doing that uh let's talk about this for a second so your mom's a  huh yeah yeah um she is your mom still alive no my mom died in 2009 yeah but my mom she she uh she traded pay medications for sexual favors um because she was junky and I found out later you know my my girlfriend's Uncle uh the one of the ways they they interacted was like he  she would give him pain pills and he would give her why would you tell anyone why would you tell anyone I would never who I would never tell the internet that my mother suck for a Lura one she would pay for sex with the Lura Taps she had access to pain meds she would give them away exchange for big long blacks and I don't like my mother remember this woman abused me so I'm here to throw her under the bus all the time cuz the woman abused me she's dead yeah she's been dead for 15 years who are we protecting at this point who  cares would she die of AIDS go say my grandmother did it way better like my grand oh no she never traded for sex but like my grandmother was a pimp she would go around and she would buy up everybody else's pain medication and hoard it to the end of the month and then Jack the price up when everybody else that's smart gang how do you I'm trying to figure out to change share my full no hold let me figure out to share my screen you got to be kidding me your mother would buy dick with Laura tabs yeah yeah yeah that's how she most  of her interactions with Johnny and also oh God I hope he's not still I probably should mention that but there was another male figure in my life that uh would routinely have sex with her in exchange for but he might still be alive so I don't want to say his name how did you know so so they were having sex she tell you that my mother had nothing the headb hit in the wall in that trailer in West vir mommy remember I for the last two years I lived at home with my mother I didn't have a room I kept my under a  couch and I slept on a couch right so there was no privacy in in this tiny little we lived in yeah but on top of thatan she didn't really feel the need to hide anything she did or said you know so wait your your father wasn't in the pitcher right well he had had a stroke um about eight year prior to all of this so he was you were you raised by your mother or raised by your father I was raised by my mother I took care of my father okay starting the age of 12 I took care of so you were raised by your mother so you learned everything  from your mother your mother bought hookers and you bought hookers yes who knew who knew who knew was your mother also fat yes no she was beautiful and skinny she was apparently beautiful in her early 20s uh but I I'm a bad judge of it I have in the uh I have a portrait of her in her 20s that she left me in her will that I just put in the Attic 10 years ago and it's just been since 2015 this has been sitting there ever since I might bring it down and show it one day but I think she was attractive when she  was like 20 my dad must have seen something in her but how do you share your screen normally it's really easy but now I don't see it yeah I I need to know how to do that I need to know how to do that for our next story for sure share your screen so I guess we're just coming to the conclusion that Boogie's innocent yeah I mean we would have to because I am but the chat chat's saying 62% guilty I mean these are the same people think I fake my cancer these are the same people that think I fake my uh  parental abuse stories you fake the swatting it's not really out of the realm of possibility I did not fake the swatting Nick but I did you gave all the wrong details I changed the date I changed the dates know but I can't think dude that that thing bothers me the most because I can't think of anything more stupid right you're there's these people that are watching your every movement right and you just lie about this police contact that never took place I no it did take place it took place that summer  I said it took place in December but it took place that summer it was also like a wellness check not a swatting right yeah it was a weaponized it was a weaponized well check is which is the same thing you know because in this in Northwest Arkansas when you do a well hold on hold on let let me speak let me speak every time they send a do a wellness check in Northwest Arkansas they send the fire department they send a f a full firet Tru they send an ambulance and they send a police unit so the entire neighborhood knows what's  happening and they sent either two or three in that year which the year I think was 2018 to 20 19 even before I was talking about being suicidal even privately to people right um and that's why I've always considered them to be weaponized welfare checks because it was a form of harassment it wasn't because I was suicidal or I was talking about being suicidal negatively with me but like a swatting and a welfare check is completely different the police come with different attitudes oh they still came you're actively shooting people the  other expect to find a dead body yeah oh I will tell you that they still came with hands on their weapons I can promise you that real real quick we got another $50 donation uh we're we're not going to take your word for it when you've lied so much referring to Boogie remember when you lied about getting doxed and then saying it was weaponized well checks like so even the chat's picking up on this yeah yeah so yeah like I said I'm at a point where you can accuse me of anything and it's always going to stick and there's nothing I can  really do about but how do you weaponize Wellness checks on someone who's so often suicidal well I wasn't likeed when I wasn't I got hit with a weapon I was well Wellness checking it like the fire department is actually kind of hostile especially when they think you're wasting their time because like they're they're not really to deal with the public yep Boogie if you can't rightclick on your picture right now and hit share screen is that all it takes think so profile mute Deen Focus this person  apps change video background show my camera show nonv video participants hold on I'll just Google it by the way um there's going to be some downtime because after Boogie figures figures this out I have to figure it out uh CU I I've never known how to do it that's part of the reason why you know I I've reacted to you know different pieces of content without you guys I don't know how to do the share screen thing to make everybody okay hold on let me walk you through it launch the Discord app start  a voice call or video call tap share screen and if you don't see this menu swipe up for more options what is what does that mean swipe up how the you swipe up swi up doing on a phone you hit Shar Tommy you know how to do this right yeah

and their tag I see it I know how to do it now yeah I see it now too I see it don't if you if you go to share screen you also have to check share system audio if you do it by screen do by application you don't have to do that but if you do by screen that needs to be checked okay so here's my chat here's everybody I've talked to and it's all just people related to the show other than like people randomly sending me  messages and as you can see just like any other message dere wait wait wait wait who who Who's dere I know we're getting doubl up who said oh I know we're getting double audio Yeah you got to uncheck it for that you can mute his window how do I do that do I do that you see the little on the right side yeah yeah there we go okay so who's Derek is that the DSP Fanboy I don't know let's see this is a message from 2020 hi Boogie I've been following you for a while on socials and always have been too nervous to reach out  publicly uh wow and then I added him 3.5 years later when I was trying to reduce my friends request list to be able to add people for the show so yeah that's whoever look how far how far down is that from the top oh god oh I totally believe oh no go all the way up could yeah well I do I I want to say this we just got a $222 22 donation saying hire more we tods we're on it we are on it uh awesome speak about hiring Wards I've seen I got thrown under the bus for a bad file which my file wasn't bad uh okay yeah we'll get  into that uh how do I remove uh boogie I'll stop sharing it yeah stop sharing it I just got to stop sharing okay uh yeah we can talk about it you want to talk about it now we want to get it out of the way cuz we got some big we got other stuff to get to I'll get it out of the way I I'm pretty much done with it like it's like I got thrown under the bus for having bad audio and I'm like no I my file was clean all the way through all right uh okay Nick uh we might have you on later thank you yeah thanks for can I ask one question yeah  what's the deal with this I because I I feel like this is a a public concern that I was wondering about so Boogie made a weird vague tweet I don't know if it's been deleted about Frank hassle apparently doing something horrible but like for the good of the internet we'll never know what it was I deleted I deleted that for a reason it's not something I'll talk about publicly ever yeah you and I you and I have a private conversation screen who's got a screenshot of this who's got a screenshot of this tweet I put it in the  chat yeah I said uh now that I'm no longer on probation I can speak freely I'm aware of some of the things that Frank has done uh that the internet for good reason will never know about I can't speak of them publicly and neither will the other people involved but the world or at least a few other people would have been better off if I had buried his ass that day and I do genuinely believe that but I immediately realized the people who've confided in me would not want me saying even that and uh I'm going to stay  quiet after that we're what what LS in that perfect realm of like did something demonstrably bad but I will I will I will tell you privately I will tell you privately because the person that's involved would be further hurt by me discussing this publicly but you you understand like this sounds like you're accusing him of like a crime two two two seconds let me just read this okay slowly because he went through it fast uh now that I am no longer on probation I can speak freely I am am aware of something Frank has done that the  internet for good reason will never know about I can't speak of them publicly and neither will the other people involved but the world or at least a few people would be better off if I buried it or buried his ass that day yes I'll be glad to tell any of you I'll tell any of you guys privately but the third parties involved would not want me to speak publicly about it it was I bet they would want to do what you did exactly it was a stupid it was a stupid laps of judgment so there is an allegation against Frank hastle that  Boogie knows about yes and now it seems like you're kind of sweeping up yes yes I'm going yes I am yes I'm going to sweep it up I'm going to absolutely bury it because I do not want the third parties to be harassed any further it would be interesting how Frank handles it oh he'll just Boogie lying he's piece of liar he's just trying to S to show up to his house and Cal him the n word more time yeah but Boogie think about it this way maybe you'll get lucky and Frank Hassel will show up at your house at the same time as and they'll  kill each other it's the same time flaming stars there and they'll get into an epic battle that'd be so funny yeah I still now that I can talk freely about the Frank Castle thing though um I will say some things about that day I what I always thought was so interesting is he showed up at the time that this air conditioner guy was here and I just want to give a huge shout out to air conditioner repair guy because Frank is in the yard doing his like beta male look at me I'm a Boog sh I'm a big boy I'm a big boy I'm a Big Daddy's big  boy you know and um and like preparing to call me the nword a bunch of times and stuff and like trying to work up the the balls to say I'm GNA call that boy the n word you know and this air conditioned repair guy doesn't know what he's involved in he's just like fixing my and uh so Frank's at the front door and I figured out pry quickly what's going on so the air conditioning repair guy he me him and I had chatted about our dogs he was playing with my dogs talking to my dogs and I'm like you're a  dog guy right will you hold my dog while I deal with this she's like sure so when you look at the photo that classic photo that got mean to death a lot of people think that's my roommate holding Sammy that is not That Is Random air conditioner repair guy holding my dog and it's so funny I'm as happy as I am that that guy help out that that he the pooch as well because he obviously we called the cops and as I was like talking to Frank my roommate was calling the cops right air conditioner repair guy said hey man the  cops are on their way if he had not said that Frank might have been there long enough for the cops to have at least talked to him possibly arrested him before he fled the state um so I I'm so grateful for air conditioning repair gu like thank you for putting up with it if you ever see this I've always wanted to give you a bigger public shout out I'm glad I can do it here on this platform it's so cool that you were that cool about it that day so cool that you wrangled my dog I just really wish you  hadn't mentioned that the cops are coming man it could have played out completely different was the objective just to get the danger off of your property no as quickly as possible the point was to get this guy in Justice for the he was doing wait let me get this front of your instead of just like you told me and I went back there were blanks you were never going to kill that guy they were blanks the other thing that we can talk about okay this is this is wait before we get into that this is driving me nuts all right first of all  the air conditioning guy is holding your dog and he's saying the cops are coming to eliminate the threat and you have the nerve to complain why even bring it up because two minutes later the cops by the by the time Franken is accomplice were in the car cuz that man by the way cannot drive a car at least he couldn't back in 2020 by the way um this man who is too afraid to drive a vehicle back in 2020 need an accomplice to drive him here um and him and his accomplice drove away um and the cops showed up two or  three minutes later and so if I'm saying I think it would have come out completely different some justice could have been served had the cops had the opportunity to speak with him and I just think it sucks that that that's not how it played out $50 Don know Boogie you've said that you've had a plan to off yourself for at least a decade now and you honestly thought people were going to be worried about you uh you've been saying uh this your entire YouTube career I've been telling you since 2020 I'm no longer suicidal nobody gives a  right uh you guys are like oh you're still suicidal no I'm not and and then Ken says why would you even bring up something you can't talk about like I know a secret but I can't talk about no longer sorry they send $50 so stop interrupting them uh no reason to ever say anything um to just put out there unless you wanted attention from it so yeah you did you did want attention immedately deleted it I I I had hoped nobody saw it I immediately deleted it it's just a stupid lapse of judgment I I was  thinking about myself and I was thinking about my beef with Frank and I wasn't thinking about the third parties involved I I haven't heard from wings wings what do you think about this I think it's stupid that I think that air conditioner story was the most boring in the planet yeah all right that's fair so what's the deal with the blanks you had blanks in the gun why would I have access to bullets okay so why did you get arrested why did you get arrested it wasn't the whole point hold on hold on stop talking over me the  whole point of you getting arrested is because you shot a gun you shot a bullet that could have potentially landed on a school the entire internet said this and not once have you said hey guys I was actually shooting blanks why because talking about it during the case was going to make it worse I offered to show them that gun that day they refused to look at it after blanks or not you were live texting me during the situation you never once mention blanks because if it gets out it's going to make the  situation worse you telling me that you're going to kill him on your reason the prosecutor went after me number one it doesn't matter whether they're blanks or not it's still dangerous how does it make the situation wait how does talking about pulling the gun on yourself you going to shoot yourself with a blank how does it make this the good point Nick how does it make the situation worse right when you're saying look a bullet entire reason oh my God can't finish what I'm saying right the the whole when you shoot a bullet in the air  it can land on someone right it can hit someone right that's the whole reason why you got in trouble that's why everyone mad I got in trouble is because the gun is real and because even firing a blank is dangerous and the da saw the op and I've told you this a 100 times the da told my lawyer he saw an opportunity to make a name for himself and look tough on gun cry it doesn't matter the da is not your friend they're your enemy The Da One pressing the Char in the call so why didn't you go out and  do multiple interviews and say hey look this was a blank I shot a blank you should have done multiple it wouldn't have helped it would have made things worse made a difference the entire reason the da was mad he thought this was a YouTube stunt gone wrong he told me da was mad when he told me he shot the blanks I went back and looked at the video and you can clearly because it's not loud enough I don't know clear I I didn't want to I I I I surprised I I mean I was in the Army I was around a bunch of guns I don't know why I didn't  pick up on it earlier blank um bullets crack um blanks just pop and they a big puff of smoke and there's a lot of smoke after he fires those were blanks if you go back sound you should have said that made the da wasn't going to come back it just going to piss him off more the entire reason this da went after me is because he thought it was a YouTube stunt gone wrong okay okay hold on make an example Hold On Boogie don't interrupt all right I want to know Nick's opinion Nick is an optic guy right should Boogie have came  out and said hey it was a blank or just stayed silent tomy's probably right it wouldn't have helped him with the court legally and honestly it probably would have made him look worse cuz he didn't even look like was going to defend himself he just brought a gun out to scare Frank I think the Optics he would have looked like more of a thank you there was not a single person that told me I should come forward without that not a single person yeah I didn't either you're probably right I just thought it was  funny you're talking about like I might pull the gun on myself Nick you have to tell my story can I asked a question like what I was under the depression you borrowed that gun why do you have blanks for a gun that you borrowed like it seems premeditated because I'm a YouTuber you know have you not seen the videos I did with mcjugger nuggets where I shot a blanket him blanks are fun guns are fun it's fun to put that in YouTube you can kill people with blanks though Boogie like I said the exact same thing  to Jesse on the day I fired one at his dad right but again I it seems like an interesting thing it seems like it would be a fun thing to do it seems like it would be a fun bit so I got blanks in the hopes that one day I would use them but we're not walking around here with loaded guns I don't like guns go back and look at how many times I've told you guys I don't like guns I don't want to own a gun I would rather put a bullet in my head than somebody else that's a tweet that people threw at me over and  over and over again is the Frank hassle thing over and over and over again I've said it I'll say it again I don't like guns when they took my guns away from it it didn't matter cuz I don't like the things I don't want them I don't like being near they make me extremely uncomfortable $50 donation a blank can kill someone if you put the gun directly to the Head uh and if you were 10t away um so you're lying uh it would have made your case so much better to be honest uh but you can't you're a pathological liar who doesn't know fact  from fiction when my lawyer discussed the blanks with the da the da said that if we would like that could be our defense in court but it didn't matter and we PL out anyway you fired in you fired a dangerous weapon in school it's nothing to do with their I'm not in school zone iing hate that why are you dumb look at a goddamn map you what youit for what was your for Nick do you have any uh anything else before we let you go I we have no I'm I'm good thank you for having me all right guys 2396 North Berkeley Drive  look it up right now tell me that I'm in a school all right so you w so all right then I I'll ConEd if I was wrong but so what were you brought in for uh uh aggravated assault against my neighbors aggravated assault okay yeah uh if you're interested in rape matter check out Nicholas dioro his Channel's uh get so that hold up you could have beat that case Boogie and here's and here's how I decided to plead out right out that hold let let me you let me finish my I don't have much voice go ahead are not allowed to basically  coarse a crime out of people so cops would had to go door too asking neighbors did they feel like they were assaulted to get that crime he basically p pencil whip that crime on top of you without a victim you would easily beat that in court with even a basic lawyer so here's what here's where my lawyer set me down and I'll tell you yes I think if we went to court we would have beat it but number one it was going to cost more money which I was running out of and which I did right spent $27,000 to get that far and I didn't have more  to spend and I knew better I just think it's so crazy that Boogie you are the biggest I know but but you're also like a felon for shooting guns buying hookers pimping out your girlfriend you're you got all this like ganger out my girlfriend what the you got all this gangster stuff about you but you're like literally like the biggest herb ever I haven't heard that in years that's so funny but again but again my lawyer set me down and he like look you have a sweetheart deal here you're going to get two years um of  non uh supervised probation you'll never have to go into p a cup you're never gonna have to do anything you should take this rather than spend the money I like going to court I would like let me finish her change I like going to court I would like to represent in court it could be fun but it could also turn out poorly for you they're going to subpoena Frank they're going to subpoena keemstar this is going to be a tremendous circus and you're probably not going to benefit from it so do you want to sit  there and watch Frank tank the stand you had a horrible lawyer you had a horrible lawyer you had the worst lawyer ever but listen there's only one person on this panel that has pass the bar exam um the qualifications in South Carolina are pretty light but go ahead Wings what's your legal opinion here my legal opinion is Boogie lawyer wanted to get wanted to just throw swipe the under the rug and he didn't actually want to go through it cuz you would have won that case 99 out of a 100 times yeah would you put your	Center			Center	162

CONGRESSWOMAN MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE IS NOT BACKING DOWN FROM EFFORTS TO END MIKE JOHNSON'S SPEAKERSHIP. IT'S GOTTEN SO BAD THAT SOME REPUBLICANS ARE WORRIED THE FIGHT COULD ULTIMATELY HAND THE GAVEL TO HOUSE MINORITY LEADER DEMOCRATIC HAKEEM JEFFRIES. GREEN BELIEVES SHE HAS HER FINGER ON THE PULSE OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. >> I PRETTY MUCH HAVE THE BEST VIEW OF HOW THE BASE FEELS AND WHAT REPUBLICAN VOTERS WANT. IT'S NOT ABOUT WHETHER YOU LIKE  PRESIDENT TRUMP OR NOT. THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, REPUBLICAN VOTERS ARE SUPPORTING HIS POLICIES, YET MIKE JOHNSON'S LEADERSHIP HAS BEEN COMPLETELY OPPOSITE. >> WITH JUST HOURS UNTIL SPEAKER JOHNSON HEADS TO MAR-A-LAGO TO MEET WITH DONALD TRUMP, THE QUESTION TODAY IS WHETHER FRUSTRATED REPUBLICAN CENTRISTS WOULD BACK JEFFRIES, JUST TO END THE CYCLE OF DYSFUNCTION AND INACTION. >> WELL, LISTEN, IF THE CHAIR IS VACATED, IT'S CERTAINLY POSSIBLE YOU GET A DEMOCRAT SPEAKER. WE HAVE DEMONSTRATED 13 TOTAL MEMBERS RAN FOR SPEAKER BEFORE I  WAS ELECTED AND IT WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT FOR ANYONE TO GET THE VOTES. >> NBC'S RYAN NOBLES JOINS US FROM CAPITOL HILL. ALSO WITH US, STEWART STEVENS WHO IS CHIEF STRATEGIST FOR THE 2012 ROMNEY PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN AND A SENIOR ADVISER FOR THE LINCOLN PROJECT. GOOD TO HAVE BOTH OF YOU HERE. SHOULD SPEAKER JOHNSON BE WORRIED? ANY STIRRINGS MODERATE REPUBLICANS MIGHT JUMP SHIP? >> Reporter: I THINK SPEAKER JOHNSON SHOULD BE WORRIED ABOUT LOSING HIS JOB. THE CHANCES THAT THE PERSON WHO REPLACES HIM ARE A DEMOCRAT ARE  PROBABLY VERY SLIM. THE SAME PROBLEM THAT REPUBLICANS HAVE WOULD BE THE SAME PROBLEM DEMOCRATS HAVE IN A SITUATION LIKE THIS. THERE JUST REALLY ISN'T ANY APPETITE FOR BIPARTISANSHIP WHEN IT COMES TO ELECTING THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE, AND SO REPUBLICANS STILL HAVE TWO MORE VOTES THAN THE DEMOCRATS DO, SO IT'S LIKELY THAT THEY WOULD HOLD ON TO THE SPEAKERSHIP, BUT IT WOULD BE ANOTHER BRUTAL BATTLE. I THINK THE MORE LIKELY SCENARIO HERE IS IF MIKE JOHNSON DOES MOVE FORWARD WITH PUTTING UKRAINE AID ON THE FLOOR,  PUTTING THE FEDERAL SURVEILLANCE PROGRAM ON THE FLOOR, AND IT PASSES, THAT MAYBE DEMOCRATS COME TO HIS RESCUE TO AT LEAST AVOID ANOTHER CYCLE OF TRYING TO REPLACE A SPEAKER LIKE THEY DID THE LAST TIME AROUND BACK IN THE FALL. LISTEN TO HOW HAKEEM JEFFRIES PHRASED IT WHEN HE WAS ASKED THE QUESTION, WOULD DEMOCRATS COME TO MIKE JOHNSON'S RESCUE IF THE SITUATION WAS RIGHT. >> NOW, I MADE THE OBSERVATION, NOT A DECLARATION, THE OBSERVATION THAT IF THE SPEAKER WERE TO DO THE RIGHT THING AND ALLOW THE HOUSE TO WORK ITS WILL  WITH AN UP AND DOWN VOTE ON THE NATIONAL SECURITY BILL THEN I BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE A REASONABLE NUMBER OF DEMOCRATS WHO WOULD NOT WANT TO SEE THE SPEAKER FALL AS A RESULT OF DOING THE RIGHT THING. >> Reporter: NOW, THAT IS SIGNIFICANT THAT THE CURRENT DEMOCRATIC LEADER IS AT LEAST OPENING THE DOOR TO THE IDEA OF A GROUP OF DEMOCRATS EITHER SITTING ON THE SIDELINE OR ACTIVELY WORKING TO HELP MIKE JOHNSON KEEP HIS JOB. THAT MAY SEEM LIKE, CHRIS, OH, HE DOESN'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THIS ANYMORE. IT'S EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE.  WHAT MIKE JOHNSON DOESN'T WANT IS TO HOLD ON TO A SPEAKERSHIP AT THE BEHEST OF DEMOCRATS. THAT PUTS HIM IN A MORE DIFFICULT SITUATION THAN THE ONE HE'S CURRENTLY IN. HE'S STANDING STILL AT THIS IMPASSE RIGHT NOW. WHAT HE WOULD REALLY LIKE TO DO IS PASS UKRAINE FUNDING, PASS FISA REFORM WITHOUT WORRYING ABOUT A MOTION TO VACATE. THAT'S NOT THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT HE'S LIVING IN, CHRIS. >> I THINK THE THING THAT JEFFRIES SAID, STEWART, THAT'S SO SIGNIFICANT IS HE SAID LET THE HOUSE WORK ITS WILL.  IMAGINE THAT. MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE SEEMS OBLIVIOUS TO THE REALITY THAT SUPPORTING TRUMP'S POLICIES DOES NOT CHANGE THE FACT THAT THERE'S A DEMOCRATIC SENATE AND A WHITE HOUSE. SO WHY IS SHE STARTING THIS FIGHT? >> LOOK, I THINK THIS IS A CLASSIC EXAMPLE OF LIFE IMITATING HIGH SCHOOL. THINK ABOUT IT, YOU KNOW, MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE IS THE MEAN GIRL WITH THE RICH DADDY WHO ALWAYS GOT OUT OF TROUBLE. MIKE JOHNSON IS THAT INVISIBLE GUY WHO ALWAYS WANTED TO BELONG, WHO WAS DESPERATE TO BE ACCEPTED, AND THAT'S JUST REALLY  A TOXIC MIX WHEN IT COMES TO SAVING THE WORLD, AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT'S AT STAKE HERE. IT'S EASY TO LOOK AT MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE, SHE'S AN INCREDIBLY UNLIKABLE PERSON WITH THE AWFUL VOICE, AND IS ONE OF THESE FREAK SHOWS THAT RUNS THROUGH CONGRESS, BUT SHE COULD CHANGE HISTORY BECAUSE IF THE UNITED STATES DOES NOT VOTE TO SUPPORT UKRAINE, IT IS GOING TO CHANGE HISTORY. TGS IT'S GOING TO BE A PALE OVER THIS COUNTRY FOR GENERATIONS AND CHANGE THE WAY EUROPE IS, IT WILL AFFECT THE WAY CHINA LOOKS  AT TAIWAN. THIS IS BIG HISTORIC STUFF, AND IT'S BEING LEFT TO THE SMALLEST OF PEOPLE, AND REALLY THE QUESTION I WOULD ASK MIKE JOHNSON IS, LET'S SAY YOU ARE A CHRISTIAN, TAKE YOU AT YOUR WORD, HOW DO YOU GO TO BED EVERY NIGHT KNOWING THAT YOUR WEAKNESS THAT NIGHT WILL KILL INNOCENT UKRAINIAN WOMEN AND CHILDREN AND MEN SLEEPING IN THEIR BEDS. HOW DO YOU LIVE WITH THAT, BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING? >> ONE OF THE THINGS HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO DO IS TALK TO DONALD TRUMP TOMORROW. THEY'RE HOLDING THAT EVENT AT  MAR-A-LAGO, HOW DOES HE NEGOTIATE, NAVIGATE THAT? >> LOOK, IT REALLY COMES TO A QUESTION OF, YOU'RE THE INHERITOR OF THE LEGACY OF THE GREATEST GENERATION, RIGHT, THEY PASSED THIS TORCH TO YOU, AND YOU'RE GOING TO EITHER HONOR THAT OR YOU'RE GOING TO HONOR THE WISHES OF THIS GOD FROM QUEENS WHO'S HAVING TROUBLE MAKING BAIL WHO'S ON TRIAL IN MULTIPLE JURISDICTIONS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. WHAT DO YOU WANT YOUR LEGACY TO BE? WHO DO YOU THINK IS GOING TO BE MORE ADMIRED? WHO DO YOU WANT TO BE, LIZ CHENEY OR SOMEONE WHO GETS VOTED  OUT OF CONGRESS BECAUSE HE DIDN'T DO THE RIGHT THING ANYWAY? I DON'T KNOW MIKE JOHNSON, YOU WOULD HOPE SOMEWHERE INSIDE THERE THERE'S ENOUGH DECENCY AND SOME SLIVER OF COURAGE TO BE ABLE TO STAND UP AND TRY TO DEFEND INNOCENT WOMEN AND 	Center			Conservative	163

O89	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySD3dzCP0MM	I never thought that these words would leave my mouth but squatters are kind of trending right now I guess I mean it seems like everywhere I look I find another story about some group of people who have illegally moved into a vacant house usually in California just saying usually in California but today's story is the most ultimate twist to this whole squatter situation there's a handyman out there named flash Shelton who has found a loophole in the law where if he becomes a Water by moving in with  squatters then he can actually get them out of the houses where they are squatting 12200 homes have been squatted in the city unfortunately some of these squatters have gotten pretty sophisticated it's just an incredibly confusing thing to think you go on vacation somebody somebody trespasses and enters your home starts living in it and then you legally can't do anything about it like call the cops and say somebody's in my house hi my name is Flash Shelton I'm the founder of the United handyman Association and I also  opened up squatter hunters.com where we help people that need to get their squatters out this is a lot of process there's a lot going on here let's get into it so this all started in Northern California there's a guy named flash who we're going to talk about here in a second his mother was trying to sell her house I guess Flash's father had recently passed away so the mom moved out the house was sitting vacant she listed the house on the market to try to sell it and one day the real estate agents showed up to the house house to  go do a showing or whatever they were going to do and they arrived to find some people who were living in the house and the house full of furniture so they call up Flash's mom to say hey who are these people who are living in the house and she's like I have no idea I didn't rent it out to anybody well that's when the mother reaches out to her son Flash and says hey can you help me out here I don't know what to do about this situation in general what you read about online and what you hear about online is  that if you're stuck in a situation like this where squatters have moved into your house especially in California then it's going to be really hard to get him out because you can't just go there and tell him to leave you can't call the police because normally the police aren't going to be able to really do anything about this so from what I understand it ends up turning into this whole thing where you have to go to court and file a bunch of paperwork and you basically end up needing to evict these squatters almost as if they're  tenants so anyways flash does all this research himself he determines that yes it looks like these squaders probably do have rights they probably are allowed to just occupy this random house but if these squatters have the rights to go just squat into his mom's house then why wouldn't he have the same rights to go just also start squatting there and kind of like use that as a tool or a catalyst to help get the squatters out I called Lo local law enforcement and as soon as they saw that there was Furniture in the  house they said that I had a slatter situation and they had uh basically no jurisdiction and they couldn't do anything so I you know I dissected the laws over a weekend I basically figured out that until there's civil action the squatters didn't have any rights so if I could switch places with them become the squatter myself I would assume those squatter rights this is a very creative way to look at the situation to say the least and he actually took it a step further and gave himself even more  rights than the squatter had because since this was his mom's house flash was not an owner of this house at all so what he did was he drafted up a lease between his mom and himself so now he was a tenant of his mom who's the owner of the property which like I said that gives him even more rights the law would prevent me from physically removing them however um being that I wasn't the homeowner I had more rights as a tenant I would actually have more rights than them so if um if they were there then I  would have just entered the home with a Le in hand I would have just shown him the lease I would have walked past him and said you know I don't know what you're doing but I'm moving in this is my house now and I probably would have just done anything and everything I could to make it miserable for them so that they left on their own all he had to do at this point was go out to California and move into the house now I'd be a little bit freaked out to do this if I was him because if someone's squatting in your house then we can  probably assume that they're not in the best place in life like at a bare minimum they're probably broke but who knows they might be a criminal they might be on drugs you really don't know but flash is a Savage he doesn't care he goes out to California he Parks his car right down the street from his mom's house and he kind of just Stakes out there and watches what's going on for a couple of days and pays attention to like who's coming and who's going and stuff he does start to notice that there's some Trends and there's some  people who are usually leaving the house in the morning hours so he figures maybe that means that those people are going to work or whatever so one morning he decides to make his move and move into his mom's house while the squatters aren't there you know I'd like to say that these are not people that are homeless they're not looking for a place to live in all of the cases that I have worked with so far it's it's a criminal type it's a self-entitled group of people that um that the laws are allowing to go in I mean it's it's it's  like this because the inter the interpretation of the laws the way they are that were never intended to allow people to take over residential maintained properties in the first place is telling them that they can move in even when somebody goes on vacation in in a situation I've dealt with um move in there's no fine there's no penalty there's no restitution now he's gotten inside which wasn't all that hard I mean he has a key to the house but once he gets inside he discovers stuff all over the place in every room like these  tenants legit fullon moved into the house their stuff was completely unpacked and everywhere and he spent the next couple hours just changing the locks installing security cameras putting in an alarm system and he even put the utilities in his name at this point his plan is fully in motion like flash is a legal tenant of his mothers he lives in the house he's all settled in he's even receiving mail here at this point he wanted all of this furniture and crap that was inside of the house gone like immediately we're talking the  same night and he came up with kind of a unique strategy on how he was going to get all of this furniture out of the house quick I saw a couple young guys across the street big strong guys I walk over and I'm like hey you know do you guys need any furniture and they're like yeah I'm like well look I said I got a house full of furniture over here that if she doesn't get this stuff out by midnight tonight um you can if you help me get it out if you help me drag it out to the driveway it's yours you can have  absolutely anything you want for free and they're like sure awesome you you know so so I already had um them lined up so now we've got living in the house like not even a full day but he fullon lives there like he has moved in and settled in and at this point he's basically just waiting for the squatters to get home so he can confront them these squatters did get back David was sitting there waiting and believe it or not they're actually pretty chill when they came back I just laid it out for them told them that it was all locked up  cameras and the only way they would get back in the house is if they broke in on camera and I would prosecute and I told them they had a day to get their stuff out or the furniture was not theirs anymore really sorry about all this I really am it's just it it's a nightmare Beyond I've got guys scheduled to come take the stuff out later today so but we're going to Lad by lad take it um out of here okay well um yeah I mean I have at this point I have no choice I just need to I understand I I I would I would  be in I mean I was overwhelmed by the amount of stuff when I pulled in here when I pulled in here yesterday I mean I didn't expect all this yeah so that's my that's my fault that that is all of it I should have paid better attention that's beside the point we just need to get it done and Tak care of because it was so just the right do what you can to get it out like I said I mean I I have to start putting stuff in the driveway and so that I can lock it up because once I leave you're not going to be able to get  back in you can tell that this lady is a good lady deep down inside she probably just came on to some hard times if you're in that situation and you're facing some hard times there's probably better things to do than just move into some stranger's house the situation reminds me a little bit of that YouTube channel called Soft White underbelly if you guys haven't seen his videos check him out he basically interviews all kinds of people who have fallen on Hard Times just like gotten into drugs or  became homeless or whatever and what you can tell if you listen to a few of this guy's podcast is that the people that that he's interviewing might be considered like bad people on the surface but deep down inside a lot of them are actually good people with good hearts that maybe just got wrapped up in the wrong group of friends or maybe just grew up in the wrong neighborhood so this initial story actually came out about a year ago but it's getting a bunch more attention now because for one there's just a bunch of squatter stories  that have come out recently and for two flash has been doing kind of like a bunch of press or whatever lately like he's been showing up on a bunch of news channels and talking about his services that he's offering which we'll talk about here in a second check it out some of those clips that we watched today was from Flash's YouTube channel it's called outside the box with flash go check him out if you guys are into this type of content he's posting a lot of videos especially lately but if we go to  popular and we look at this one this here is the video that has gotten him the most amount of attention for sure it's called how I remove squatters in less than a day this video has got a lot of people talking it's got over 25,000 comments like this one here says what boggles my mind is that when someone loses their home to the bank police and sheriffs are present to evict the homeowner but they won't do anything to evict the squatters who are not even homeowners this guy says that it's a joke that criminals have more rights  than law- abiding citizens which I agree like I'm trying to figure out who out there in the world is giving these squatters rights like I can't really imagine on either side of the fence republican or democrat or whatever like what lawmaker is thinking that is actually a good idea to give squatters rights I don't know if you guys know let me know down in the comments but I have no clue who would be in support of this Dad lifts 007 says if you break into an empty house it's a felony if you bring  all of your stuff and stay the cops can't touch it got it there's a lot of people who are saying flash great job for staying so chill especially because he was going in here and kicking people out who were taking advantage of his mother who was grieving at the time and what I'm gathering from all the people showing up in the comments who are realtors and attorneys and stuff like that the consensus seems to be that if any of us are in a situation like this in the future where we're going to have  a house that's going to be sitting vacant for a little while we need to put all the right precautions in place like putting security cameras in the front and the back side of the house you should make sure that no one can just call and put Utilities in their name without having a special pin code or passcode and it's a good plan too to just have your neighbors engaged and make sure that they know that you own this house and it's going to be sitting vacant for a little while and if they could just kind of keep an eye out for  you that could go a long way too now I wasn't able to figure out what Flash's full-time job even is at the moment his Instagram says that he's a public figure an anti- squatter activist a squatter Hunter founder of the United handyman Association and host of that YouTube channel that we looked at earlier treat them like what they are they are trespassers until you give them rights they're trespassers they're not squatters people trying to squat aren't actually squatters until you Empower them let's get your squatters out he has  this website squatter hunters.com and this page is dedicated to basically anyone out there who has squatters in their house and they need help you can actually go to flash through clicking one of these buttons and he'll do a zoom consultation with you and he'll actually maybe offer to help get those squatters out of your house by doing the same thing that he did with his mom's house if we go to the about tab we got a little bio about Flash which we already know a good amount about him and look if  we go down here he actually has a team like flash is one of the removers he has this guy Dylan who's also a remover and then he even has this guy Mike hired who does I guess just investigation and research probably to figure out like maybe who these squatters are or who the owner is or what the laws are in that particular area where they're going to remove the squatters because that is the tricky part about what he's doing is the rules and laws are going to differ for sure based on where the house is located  flash also does have a GoFundMe which is to help contribute to changing the squatter Li I don't know flash personally I don't know anything about this fundraiser so I'm not telling you guys to go and put your money into this or anything but I just wanted to put it out there that he's raised 10 grand already he's looking to raise 25,000 and apparently this money is going to help rewrite the laws that would allow law enforcement to basically do their job and get Squad ERS out of homes faster seems like that's the general idea here  so yeah check this thing out if you guys are interested in supporting flash

O115	https://youtu.be/Ah1pJikH__A?si=zmYPanTUaVfkytDz	More in 2 minutes. And welcome back here to live now from Fox I'm Andrew craft. We're approaching the bottom of the hour here. Uh, it's a good place to reset about where we are. uh in this uh, very scary. scary night for Israelis up and down the country from the north. to the South. Uh, and the kind of silver lining in IDF says it has intercepted with the help of the United States a majority. of the projectiles. uh, that it faced incoming from Iran. Those are drones. cruise missiles. ballistic missiles. as well here. So  let's get a reset. Let's uh rely like we have so much so uh from Fox News Foreign Affairs correspondent, Trey yingst in Israel with some great reporting. He just filed this report. Let's watch Israel putting its forces on high alert Saturday night. shutting down its airspace as Iran launched dozens of drones and the attack retaliation for a strike on Iran's consulate earlier this month that killed 2 top Iranian generals. Iran blames Israel for that strike, taken responsibility rumors of War have been swirling  in the intelligence Community ever since Israel reading its defenses in response. trying to shoot down the drones before they reach his airspace. Israel Also directing residents in several areas. to stay near bomb shelters. This is a severe. and dangerous escalation. our defensive and offensive capabilities are at the highest level of readiness. I'll post on X by the Iranian government through their permanent mission to be quote deemed concluded and warned the us against getting involved. though  US military officials Tell Fox they have already shot down at least 1 Iranian drone President Biden returning to Washington Saturday night. convening a meeting of the National Security Council the White House maintaining its commitment to Israel. is Ironclad. saying in a statement the United States will stand with the people of Israel and support their defense against these threats from Iran. before this Iran had only targeted Israel through proxy forces and avoided direct attacks. tonight's event fueling fears  about the possibility of a broader Regional War in Tel Aviv Trey in Fox News Trey thanks so much in the meantime, uh, you saw that photo in trees report. I think it's worth. um showing you yet again, uh, that is a meeting there in The Situation Room. uh President Biden says this I just met with my National Security team for an update on Iran's attacks against Israel. our commitment to Israel's security against threats from Iran and its proxies. is Ironclad and if we maybe could take the photo full. I just want to  point out. who's in the room you see there. CIA director Bill Burns you see their Director of National Intelligence. Averill Haynes you also see Secretary of State Anthony blinken, uh, and on the uh, side of the table next to President adviser. Jake Sullivan. Secretary of Defense Lloyd, Austin next to him the chairman of the Joint Chiefs. General CQ Brown as uh the National Security team in full focus in the Situation Room gaming out some of these scenarios. as well. We're going to continue to game out some  of these scenarios, but I from the reporting. um that the barrage by Iran, is largely over. Uh, and so I think that is significant It's worth noting We're going to be reiterating well. alongside our guest. uh foundation for defense of democracies, uh expert in our friend Hussain Abdul Hussein. He joins me, um, Hussein. Thanks for being with us Uh, but we know you study this region of the world so well, you're very knowledgeable. about this and that's the news at this now bottom of the hour. um that it is over  the barrage is done. Are you hearing that too? Well, it looks like it. and judging by history the time when responded to. America taking out customs slemani they did they had a similar pattern they fired the missiles foreigners are at the time. said that it was over. So I see a repeat. now coming through the UN. so to my mind this looks to be over so far now, I think. would probably be waiting for to see what what Israel's response would be but that that would be a different story altogether. You know,  who's saying just yesterday Biden when asked about uh, Iran's plans to do this. uh with a 1-word answer in reply. He said simply don't uh clearly Iran did not heed that message. Was that a failure of deterrence? on the Biden White House's part here or was Iran going to go about this. Anyway, remember all throughout last week? uh us officials have been working through back channels to get to Iran to tell them to stop. they didn't heed those warnings. uh, were they futile in hindsight do you think Well, I think  now is the chance for this Administration to? uh prove itself. to show what it means when it says don't. uh, and to show that it is consistent and its message. and prove that it's really stands with Israel. that which which we we've been hearing over the past few days. So, uh Iran clearly didn't listen to Washington even though we were told that there was a lot of back Channel sides. now it's it's incumbent on this Administration to show us what it means. I mean, what would be the consequences? when Iran  doesn't listen to to what America says? and when Iran tries to push the whole region to the brink of full scale War just across the region not like over small areas. uh from Iran. to Israel probably with other players involved. north and south east and west What about the US? role in all of this? Obviously, we were instrumental in helping Israel intercept a majority of these drones. um will we be involved at all when we play a role in Israel's retaliation do you think I think there's a lot of room  for the United States to be involved and retaliation without. military getting its hands. dirty or involved in the war. There's a lot of support. Logistics uh, you name it. There's a lot of uh tools and facilities and resources that we can make available without actually having the US military getting involved now, I think this is the reason why Iran, said out loud that we are going to war or we are going to strike Israel. Uh, but America is not part of this. and America better stay out of this so the  Iranians realize that if if they strike. uh the US will support 1 way or another I think that's something that scares them to an extent. They understand. the amount of our resources. So we'll see whether you know, what kind of supports we offer Israel as the as they prepare their response. will the Biden BB relationship recover after this do you think that this will become another rallying point? for Israelis behind Bibi Netanyahu? Well, I think it's in the best interest of both sides to put Politics on the side and  stick to policy. and to uh focus on. what's at hand. the Iranian Danger. to the Jewish State and the think as long as we're thinking clearly. there's no need to think. who's in charge in Washington or who's in charge. in? in Jerusalem. Uh, where to allow Nations regardless of of who's the ruler here or there? So I think if if this kind of thinking is is you know is persist I think you know things will go smooth. Okay, but there's a fear that we might always go back to politics. each its own domestic audience  and I think you know, I don't see it happening now thankfully, but if we go back that's not something that I want to see at least I want to put up this uh tweet Alon Levy, uh, the government spokesperson there for Israel with this photo, Uh, who's saying, prime minister Netanyahu is on the phone with President Biden right now after the security cabinet meetings there so, uh kind of each side putting out their respective. photos and media about some of these conversations and phone calls uh that have taken place,  you know. we would be remiss who's saying if we didn't bring up the Israel Hamas War the war that is currently ongoing related to that is this so indirect? and and tangential? or is it directly? um related to what's happening in in Gaza? Help us make those connections if there are any Uh what we know is that this whole what we see tonight. started because Iran planned October 7 Israel took out the rgc Iranian General. General zahedi who was in Damascus meeting with 6 other generals. This is the guy  who himassi by saying that by thanking him. by as as the guy who helped. plan so we know that Israel went after him. for his role on October 7. and this is why we're here now. Uh, so now that the war in Gaza has a bit receded to the background with with Israel making so much gains except for Rafa, I think the focus has turned all of us call the the head of the octopus now, we're not dealing with the arms anymore is is not dealing with the arms whether it's Hamas or has now the focus is on Iran itself and we see the  war now happening between Iran and and Israel. with no proxies in between them. operation? Uh, is that completely? off the table Is that completely? sidelined after tonight or or will Israel Go full forward with it? I don't this is off the table and I think that Israel. is low lower the intensity of the war in Gaza because Clearly Now ability to hurt. Israel the Israeli population or the Israeli economy anymore. Uh, but this does not mean that the Hamas problem has disappeared. and this does in Gaza right now is  sustainable. for either side on the long term. Uh, so I think Israel can put shelf for now to deal with Iran. and I think this is in the best interests of Israel. Is it now we'll focus on Iran and after that you know, I think if if Iran, gets, a hit if Iran to an extent to the politically or on a military level, I think we will see Hamas act and behave differently. Hamas acts and behave in such a way because they think that they have support from a powerful party which is in I think if if in Iran itself uh, maybe  that that will reflect. on Hamas and on. the future, Okay? Yeah. I want to put that tweet up again. from BB there. uh talking on the phone with Biden and we're getting some more reporting on this phone Call Hussain. according to Jackie Heinrich at the White house, official says the call has ended and it lasted around. before we let you go. See I mean, what do you think was said on the phone call? well to my mind 25 minutes is a long phone call. It's comprehensive. It's you know. it doesn't look like you know, they  just exchanged the uh, uh pleasantries or not between the 2 sides So they must have talked. uh about things. in depth. I think. um, probably uh, BB offered his assessment. offered his next. plan and heard what President Biden had to say. I wouldn't say that there's least judging by the public statements of both sides. I think he more or less probably got the US blessing for whatever. Israel. plans to do next. Uh V Iran. All right. Iran. All Hussein with the foundation for defense of democracies. Um, thank you  for making time for us tonight Ken. Thank you enough. Uh, and we'll talk 	Liberal			Center	167

O144	https://youtu.be/tWJho-YV9FI?si=pFbmE-DjC8iID9zA	let's talk about the two-state solution Israel living alongside the new state of Palestine it's long been seen as the answer but remains elusive with the war in Gaza it's back in the headlines the only real solution is a two-state solution over time a lasting end to the Israeli Palestinian conflict can only comes through a two-state solution a future in which two states live side by side in peace and security so what do people actually mean when they talk about a two-state solution how long has the idea been  around and why do some people think that it's become more of an avoidance strategy that lets politicians off the hook they use this as a tool to absolve themselves of responsibility it's a form of escapism the two-state solution is all about deciding how this land is divided who lives there and who controls it now you might think it's about getting Israelis and Palestinians to agree on a simple split but there's nothing simple about it just look at the map for a start this is Israel and then you have the  Palestinian territories which are under Israeli military occupation and cut off from each other gaza's here Israel's war has left the strip in Ruins and the West Bank is more like a patchwork of Palestinian land because of all the settlements Israel has built over the years these are illegal under international law there are now 700,000 Israeli settlers living on Palestinian land and it makes the path to a Palestinian State much more complicated if this was meant to be a question of two states and if it was question of  drawing a border believe me a border would have been drawn a long time ago the problem is is that this has never been about a line it's about the rights of individuals it's about history the region of Palestine has been fought over for thousands of years and controlled by different ancient kingdoms and empires in more modern times it was part of the Ottoman Empire but the British took control there during the first world war and it later became known as British mandate Palestine the population was 78%  Muslim 11% Jewish and 10% Christian according to a census in 1922 now even before they took control the British supported the idea of establishing a Jewish homeland in Palestine it was stated in a letter known as the Balor declaration and the Jews were promised a national home in Palestine that was the aim of a movement called Zionism it encouraged Jews to move to British mandate Palestine and in the 1920s and 30s more and more did many were fleeing persecution in Europe but the growing Jewish population led to  tension with the local Arab population the Palestinians Jewish and Arab armed groups cropped up and there was violence in response a British commission suggested partitioning the land but there was no support for the idea the scheme to divide the country between Arabs and Jews has pleased nobody in Palestine an agitation has fended discontent to the point of terrorism in the 1940s the question of what should happen in Palestine grew more urgent so did pressure to establish a Jewish homeland especially after World  War II and the Holocaust in 194 7 the British asked the United Nations to make recommendations on the future government of Palestine and this is what they came up with another partition plan which allocated 56% of the land to a Jewish State and left 43% for an Arab State the remaining land including Jerusalem with all of its holy sites would be under International control the UN General Assembly voted to adopt the plan Jewish leaders accepted it but Arab leaders rejected it they saw it as deeply unfair  especially because the Arab population was the majority the following year Israel went ahead and declared itself a state and five Arab Nations went to war with Israel Israel calls it their war of independence Palestinians call it the neba which means catastrophe because in that fighting more than 700,000 Palestinians fled or were forced from their homes many ended up in Jordan Lebanon and Syria by the way that's important to know about because when people talk about a few future Palestinian State one of the big  questions is whether all those Palestinians and their descendants will get to go back What's called the right of return now after the 1948 War Israel ended up with 78% of the land so more than the UN partition plan that left 22% for Palestinians to live in split between the West Bank and East Jerusalem which Jordan controlled and Gaza which Egypt controlled those borders became known as the Green line they're still the internationally recognized borders of Israel and it's more or less the division that many people have in mind  when talking about a two-state solution but then in 1967 there was another War Israel pushed out Jordan and Egypt seized control of the West Bank East Jerusalem and Gaza and imposed a military occupation many many many countries then started to put pressure on Palestinians to say You must recognize Israel's existence you have to recognize that Israel took over 78% of your historic Homeland and instead let's try to get back that remaining 22% in the Palestinian side the idea of territorial partition was very very  difficult uh but by the 1970s there are some who were pushing saying you know look we're never going to get all of historic Palestine we can build a state on a portion of liberated Palestine and in 1988 there was an official shift by that point the pl o the Palestinian Liberation Organization had become the main group representing Palestinians and their cause its chairman yaser arat declared the independence of [Music] [Applause] Palestine and although the Declaration was mostly symbolic it was important  because Arafat also made it clear that he accepted the principle of partition and the existence of Israel that helped pave the way for the Oslo Accords a pair of agreements which are seen as the beginning of the peace process it started out with secret talks in Norway's capital that's where the name comes from and it led to this moment the Israeli and Palestinian leaders shaking hands on the White House lawn after Decades of fighting they declared their commitment to Peaceful coexistence so what were the details of  Oslo well in The First Agreement 1993 the two sides formally recognized each other which was a big deal they set out a timetable for Israel to start withdrawing from parts of the occupied territories and for Palestinians to get more autonomy that led to the creation of the Palestinian Authority or PA although its power was and still is limited it's more like a local Council than a government and the PA only operates in parts of the Palestinian territories because in the second dolo agreement the West Bank was carved up  into three administrative areas what the peace process was all about was not about Israel accepting the 78% and letting Palestinians live freely in the remaining 22% instead what it was about was Israel takes the 78% puts it in its pocket and then negotiates over the remaining 22% now the Alo Accords were interim Arrangements they were only supposed to last 5 years and in that time the two sides Were Meant to to negotiate the really tough stuff what are called the permanent status issues so things like  how to share Jerusalem the city has huge religious importance for both sides and they both see it as their Capital the issue of Palestinian refugees and whether they get the right of return we mentioned earlier what to do about all the Israeli settlements security arrangements and where you draw those final borders so Oslo looked like it was heading in the direction of a two-state solution but it wasn't actually out the Osa Accords are sometimes remembered as having um sort of promised a two-state  solution that is absolutely and completely false it's very very work carefully drafted in order to avoid mentioning anything about Palestinian State still the two sides were talking to each other there was a lot of diplomacy going on and many people felt optimistic about it there were a lot of Peace conferences on all kind of levels Grassroots politicians journalists artists there was a hope in the air but there was opposition to the peace process too on both sides in Israel there were big protests  against Oslo close to half of the society that said we're not on board with this process talking to terrorists this is going to uh mean Israeli withdrawal from territory that is an essential part of the land of Israel in 1995 a Jewish nationalist who rejected the peace process assassinated prime minister Yak rabim so very early on one of the main architects of the oso Accords was [Music] gone there was also opposition on the Palestinian side for lots of reasons there are many Palestinians ill and they  were also in the late 90s who didn't agree with the p of Arafat namely that the Palestinian should recognize the state of Israel there are many Palestinians who believe that all Palestine belongs to the Palestinian People Israel took it from them in 48 and they feel that there's no room for compromise that was the position of some armed groups like Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad who carried out attacks on Israel there were also Palestinians who opposed Oslo because of their frustration about how little it was  delivering Israel never fully withdrew from the territory it promised and it kept building settlements we'll come back to that in a minute at least part of the Palestinians feel that they are cheated that this was a c for Effective Israeli annexation just a complete disillusionment with diplomacy a complete disillusionment with negotiations with the with with the Oslo process and and and so on by the end of the 9s oslo's 5-year time frame was up and the peace process was basically on life support there was a push to save it  at Camp David the US president country Retreat how is it going Mr President how long is it going to take Mr President we pledged to each other we would answer no questions and offer no comments but the summit ended without an agreement and if anything there was more distrust as both sides blamed each other for the failure soon after that frustration and anger boiled over the trigger was this visit by a senior Israeli politician to the alaxa Moss compound in East Jerusalem a super inflammatory move  check out our episode on aloa if you want to understand why there were riots and it led to an uprising known as the second inata Palestinians staged huge protests some carried out attacks on Israel and Israel used heavy military force against Palestinians it was more than 4 years of intense conflict and all the peace efforts just were burning in the fire of the intifa but they weren't complet completely extinguished there were many more attempts over the years to get the peace process back on track and the  two-state solution became the stated goal of all that diplomacy they begin to say maybe one of the problems with Oslo is it didn't spell out any end so let's spell something out let's give something to the Palestinians um and this is when you begin to have open declarations from the United States that there should be an entity called Palestine at the end but while the International Community seemed to be doubling down on the two-state idea there were other developments pulling momentum in the opposite  direction let's run through three major ones starting with settlements which Israel kept on expanding even during the height of the peace process it was as though the Oslo agreements gave Israel the green light to build and expand settlements with the thinking being and they used to say this we have to take every Hilltop and then we can negotiate down and and that's why between the years of 1993 to the year 2000 that's why we saw virtually a doubling in the number of settlers from 200,000 to almost  400,000 once you are not ready to freeze the settlements you give the message that you don't agree to a Palestinian State cuz if you have an intention to continue to build on Palestinian ground so for sure you have no intention to evacuate it then there's the way that Politics on both sides have developed since the early 2000s on the Israeli side there's been a strong shift to the right and fewer politicians who back the two-state idea an ultra nationalist ideology that was once thought of as Extreme has now  become part of the mainstream settlers who openly call for the full annexation of all Palestinian territory are government ministers and in his speech at the UN prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu held up a map of Israel that covered the whole land on the Palestinian side the challenge is more about who actually speaks for the Palestinian people because it's not that clear you've got the PLO which still represents Palestinians internationally Arafat was the chairman but he died in a suspected poisoning in 2004 and was replaced by  Mahmud abas Abbas is also the president of the PA but the PA doesn't operate in Gaza anymore because after elections in 2006 Hamas ended up in control there so Palestinian leadership is already split and then there are bigger questions around legitimacy there haven't been elections since that vote in 2006 these days abas is pretty unpopular he's seen as old and out of touch and the PA is accused of being corrupt and working too closely with israelian authority not only does not have any um uh credibility  and doesn't no longer has any capacity it's virtually disintegrating in the West Bank on the other hand polls show that Hamas and its leader isma Han are more popular than Mahmud Abbas but several countries classify Hamas as a terrorist organization and refuse to recognize it as a representative of Palestinians so where has all of this left the peace process well dead basically the last time there were direct negotiations about a two-state solution was in 2014 during the Obama Administration so a decade ago you need  uh credible leaders in Israel and Palestine which we we don't have you need serious mediation from outside which we don't have and you need a mobilized uh Regional and Global public opinion to support the two negotiating parties but it's nowhere on the horizon right now this is where the US also comes in for a lot of criticism because while it's always had an important role as a mediator the US is also Israel's biggest Ally and protector Americans have such a leverage over Israel who Israel is politically economically  diplomatically internationally and obviously H militarily totally dependent on the United States they never really took measures to push Israel they just you know condemned Israel with talking you don't get anything and then there's everything that's happened since October 7th 2023 around 1,00 people were killed in hamas's attacks on Israel that's according to the Israeli authorities in response Israel vowed to wipe out Hamas its war on Gaza has killed more than 31,000 Palestinians most of them women and  children the un's highest court said there is a plausible risk of [Music] genocide and against that horrifying backdrop Talk of the two-state solution is back it's once again being presented as the only option for lasting Peace by a range of world leaders and organizations the United States continues to believe that the best viable path indeed the only path is through a two-state solution what's the Palestinian position well the two-state solution Remains the stated goal of the PLO hamas's position is less  clear in 2017 they published a document that did accept the formation of a Palestinian State along the 1967 borders some took it to mean that Hamas was open to diplomacy but Hamas is never explicitly recognized Israel and it maintains its right to use violence against the occupation as for Israel's current position well officials from the Prime Minister down have repeatedly rejected the idea of a two-state solution is there still a chance for a two-state solution I think it's about time for the world to realize the oso  Paradigm failed on the 7th of October and we need to build a new one and in order to build a new one do that new one include the Palestinians living in a state of their own is that what it includes biggest question is what type of Palestinians are in the other side this what Israel realized o the answer is absolutely no it's not that the two-state solution is absolutely utterly forever impossible it's just politically very very unlikely and would require such a coincidence of interests and political determination that his  likelihood is extremely slim so there's a lot of skepticism plus there's an accusation that all the talk of a two-state solution is actually part of the problem those words have become the Fig Leaf it's become a way of plating Palestinians very very convenient to believe that there is a solution somewhere on the on the shelf and one day we will take it and use it but it's not there anymore some people argue that there needs to be a more drastic change in mindset to one that's more realistic about the current  situation where you've got one state the state of Israel that has almost total control over Palestinian life and enforces a system of discrimination that human rights groups describe as apartheid the argument goes why not focus on fixing that with a one-state solution so rather than dividing the land you focus on how to govern it and ensure everyone's rights are protected regardless of their religion or ethnicity we have a one state we don't have to create it we have to create a new regime only to turn it from an  aparte system to a to a democracy I don't want to oversimplify it it's right now it seems Unthinkable it's not like we will do a magic and this will work but at least I can see a road somewhere often times people talk in terms of escapism oh this will be undone with one-state solution or be undone with uh a two-state solution but what we really need to focus on is ending that violence will Palestinians do they want to have their own separate entity their own separate State certainly some do but the vast majority  are not looking to have a state the vast majority are looking to have that their rights are enshrined and protected and that's got to be the starting point we've done lots of other explainers related to Israel and Palestine here's one we filmed in East Jerusalem this one is all about the US Israel [Music] relationship 	Leaning Conservative			Center	169
O151	https://youtu.be/ASHMVqbyjqo?si=t3qHuBmT-3ezx8Vc	I want to tell your audience this you know people always do this thing where they gowell you got CNN over here and you got Fox over here and they kind of both do their own thing well what about AP and what about Reuters and what about USA Today what about all these places you leave out who are clearly in the camp of the left I mean they all regurgitated this story the same way these are people understand what fox is doing and people understand what MSNBC is doing but what they don't really understand is what USA Today and AP and  reiders are doing which is lying as well yeah you're so right that's why the NPR expose written by this guy earlier this week was so telling because he's still on the inside uh it was published at the Free Press and he came out with uh an article all about his own organization his name is Yuri Berliner senior business editor worked at has worked continues to at NPR for 25 years and piece is exposing how extensive the rot is inside of NPR how everything is seen through a diversity lens there's NPR no  R for the black employees my friend accurately pointed out there's no NPR Blanc Adam that's not a thing there's an affinity group for every kind of racial group all of their coverage is seen through that lens there are no conservatives literally not one in at least the DC Bureau and I'm sure it's true for most of NPR um and yet they're publicly funded they have Government funding Trump saying the other day it it ought to be rescinded and now you've got the New York Times cleanup piece on it saying okay they've  been accused of liberal bias NPR in turmoil after it is accused of liberal bias as though it's just an allegation and then they say that they've responded forcefully they've forcefully pushed back and they're evidence is to quote Edith chapen the organization's editorinchief saying quote we believe that inclusion among our staff with our sourcing and in our overall coverage is critical to sell to telling the nuanced stories of the country and our world that's not forcefully pushing back that's admitting that you're obsessed  with Dei instead of news and you as this internal guy Yuri Berliner points out haven't raised your minority viewership or reading population by one person there's still dirt low no they don't want to watch or listen to your Publications any more than whites or Asians do well couple things I experienced this firsthand I think about 10 years ago one of my books came out I went to Manhattan I was doing a media tour and I went down to NPR and I think I was on Brian lair's show and and I sat down and did a long  interview with him audio interview and at the beginning of the interview he tried to bust me because he played a snippet of my podcast where there was a stereotypical Asian voice being used and he thought it was me and he tried a gotcha moment at the beginning of the interview which is first off thank you very much I'm just sitting down to do an interview and we're here to talk about my comedy book but you try your gu thing because you're NPR and you're woke fine uh I had to inform him that that voice was Joe Coy  who is Asian and that was not me who was doing that voice and he said H I said I appreciate what you're trying to do you're trying to catch me but you didn't catch me because you didn't do your research well enough I was interviewing an Asian man who's a comedian who did Nation voice um they then did didn't air that video uh and I should say they didn't air the interview and then other people came in like John Waters other authors came in and they would they played his his interview and I kept contacting them saying when are you  going to play my interview and uh they said we're doing a a fun drive a a pledge drive so we're not going to do it this week but we'll do it next week they never aired it they buried it and at the end they said you can come back to New York and redo it if you want so here's here's what I'm GNA say NPR and Brian Lair and when you look these guys up they're like respected journeyman journalist you know the truth is the beacon of light you idiots got busted trying to bust me doing an interview I came to you I sat down to do an  interview about my comedy book you tried to bust me because your politics you got busted and then you buried the tape and you've never aired it um so that's a kind of Journalism and those are the kind of cowards and hypocrites you get over there at NPR so I was aware of this many years ago and here's the bottom line 86 I believe of the people on their editorial staff are Democrats with zero Republicans but they always claim like well that doesn't taint us or or that doesn't changed way oh go let's just say 86 of  the people were vegan and there were zero meat eaters on that would you be doing glowing reviews of barbecue joints right right well said and on top of that now they're saying they're blaming this guy saying oh the next time one of our people calls up a republican Congressman or something and tries to get an answer from them they may well say oh I've read these stories you guys aren't fair so I'm not going to talk to you they're actually that's their managing editor of standards and practices trying to blame the likely  reluctance of Republicans to deal with NPR after this on Yuri as opposed to the actual content of what he's saying and the content that we hear from NPR all the time it's like NBC saying oh now Republicans aren't going to want to come on after what we did to Ron McDaniel and that's somehow I guess Ron McDaniel's fault no this you have yourself to blame for this folks 100% and look it's all stuff we knew anyway right I mean isn't all this stuff just stuff we knew anyway like oh Russian collusion okay there was nothing  there Hunter Biden's laptop was fake okay uh Co came from a wet Market okay ior mein's horse B okay we all knew it we all knew what they were doing they were lying and uh there's a little game I like to play Megan called stupid or liar so NPR got everything wrong they got the Russian collusion wrong they got everything Co wrong they got Hunter Biden live so are they stupid or they lying because either way you don't have to listen to that I'm assuming they were lying yeah or they weren't lying and  they're just the worst news Outlet ever because they got everything wrong they're lying I mean in in Yuri's piece he talks about how there they were openly saying oh I'm glad we're not going to cover the hunter Biden laptop thing that's good for Trump that could help Trump they're on a mission the piece is absolutely stunning because we did know but it's very juicy to hear it from an Insider debt you can go to bed thinking

THE HOUSE RETURNING TO SESSION TODAY FOR A ROBUST FOREIGN POLICY WEEK IN RESPONSE TO IRAN'S UNPRECEDENTED ATTACK ON ISRAEL OVER THE WEEKEND. >> Carley: 17 BILLS ARE EXPECTED TO HIT THE HOUSE FLOOR MEANT TO HAMMER IRAN AND SHOW SUPPORT FOR OR ALLY, ISRAEL. CORY MILLS SITS ON THE HOUSE SERVICES AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE AND JOINS US NOW. GOOD MORNING FEW. THIS IS GOING TO BE A COMPLICATED PROCESS. WHAT ARE YOUR EXCEPTIONS WHEN IT COMES TO FORCING ANY FORM OF ISRAELI AID PACKAGE THIS WEEK?  >> WELL, I THINK, FIRST OFF, WE NEED TO BE REMINDED THAT WE PASSED AN ISRAELI AID PACKAGE MONTHS AND MONTHS AGO. WE PASSED $14.3 BILLION, WAS AN OFFSET PAY FOR FROM THE IRS. AND THE SENATE AND CHUCK SCHUMER HAS REFUSED TO TRY AND SUPPORT OUR ALLY. WHY THEY HAVE ACTUALLY DONE IT IS BECAUSE THEY WANT MORE MONEY FOR UKRAINE. LOOK, THERE'S A LOT OF US WHO HAVE ASKED 100 PERCENT AUDITS ON UKRAINE. THERE IS A LOT OF US WHO HAVE ASKED WHAT THE ACTUAL DEFINITION OF SUCCESS. WHAT IS A MILITARY STRATEGY THAT  WINS LOOK LIKE? THEY'RE UNABLE TO PROVIDE IT. RIGHT NOW WE KNOW OUR GREAT U.S. ALLY IN THE MIDDLE EAST NEEDS SUPPORT. WHAT WE NEED TO BE LOOKING AT THE MILITARY DEFENSE THAT HE NEED RIGHT NOW TO TRY TO REARM THINGS LIKE THE IRON DOME WHICH HAS KEPT THE ISRAELIS SAFE. I THINK WE NEED AN AID PACKAGE THAT IS NOT GOING TO DRIVE AMERICANS INTO ECONOMIC DEFAULT. >> Todd: OKAY. TO THAT POINT, WHAT EXACTLY IS GOING TO BE IN THESE BILLS AND WILL THERE BE A PUSH TO TIE IT TO UKRAINE AGAIN? >> WELL, I THINK THERE IS  DEFINITELY GOING TO BE A PUSH TO TIE IT TO UKRAINE, TODD. WE HAVE GOT SOME PEOPLE WHO ARE JUST UKRAINE, UKRAINE, UKRAINE. I WISH THEY WERE AMERICA, AMERICA, AMERICA. UNFORTUNATELY OUR BORDER WALLS AND OPEN INVASION THAT'S GOING ON IN THE SOUTH AND IN THE NORTH IS BEING COMPLETELY IGNORED FOR EVERYONE ELSE'S PRIORITIES. LOOK, FOR ME, I WOULD LIKE TO SEE AT A MINIMUM, IF THEY ARE GOING TO TETHER UKRAINE AND ISRAEL TOGETHER, AT LEAST MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE POLICY RIDERS LIKE HR 1, THE LOW COST ENERGY  ACT THAT'S GOING TO HELP TO BUILD ECONOMIC GROWTH IN AMERICA. SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO ACTUALLY IMPACT THE AMERICANS TO GET OUR COST OF GAS DOWN, THE COST TO HEAT AND COOL OUR HOUSES DOWN. LET'S START PRIORITIZING AMERICA FIRST. LET'S START TRYING TO GET POLICY WRITERS SUPPORTING AMERICA AS WELL AS FOR OUR ALLIES ABROAD IF THAT'S WHAT IS NECESSARY. >> Carley: CONGRESSMAN, DID YOU SEE THIS NEWS U.S. OFFICIAL CONFIRMED TO FOX THAT ROUGHLY 50% OF THE BALLISTIC MISSILES FIRED BY IRAN FAILED TO LAUNCH  OR CRASH BEFORE REACHING TARGET. THAT OFFICIAL SAID SO MUCH FOR THE VAUNTED MISSILE CAPABILITIES OF IRAN. THAT SEEMS LIKE A PIECE OF GOOD NEWS. >> WELL, IT'S A PIECE OF GOOD NEWS. WE HAVE ALWAYS KNOWN THAT IRAN'S ACTUAL EQUIPMENT, WHICH MANY OF IT IS SUPPLIED BY CHINA AND RUSSIA, IS NOT AT THE HIGHEST QUALITIES. BUT I ALSO LOOK AT THIS AND WONDER WHETHER OR NOT IT'S A VERY SIMILAR INCIDENT TO WHAT THEY DID AFTER THE SUCCESSFUL COUNTER-TERRORISM STRIKE BY PRESIDENT TRUMP WHERE WE ELIMINATED KASSEM SOLEIMANI.  THEY THEN RETURNED BY FIRING BALLISTIC MISSILES THAT NEVER IMPACTED ANY OF THINKING DESIGNATED TARGETS. WE HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND VAUGHN ALWAYS ON THE VERGE OF REVOLUTION. THEY HAVE TO APPEASE. THIS COULD BE THE SAME THING. THEY HAVE TO REALIZE HISTORIC THING FOR TRIUNE LAUNCH FROM THEIR NATION NOT BY PROXIES NOT BY OUTSIDE AREAS LIKE BY LEBANON OR SYRIA. THIS IS DIRECT.

ONLY ONE REASON THEY LEAKED THAT THAT IS SO ISRAEL DOES RESPOND WE TOLD THEM NOT TO DO IT AT LEAST SOMEHOW, IN SOME WAY  APPEASE THE SO-CALLED PEACE ACTIVISTS BY THE WAY. THESE CEASE-FIRE NOW PEOPLE OUT YESTERDAY CHEERING THE LAUNCH OF HUNDREDS OF ROCKETS AND DRONES AGAINST ISRAEL. PEOPLE OUT THERE CHEERING, MILITARY ATTACKS OF THIS SCALE AND SCOPE ARE NOT PEACE ACTIVISTS. THESE ARE ANTI-SEMITICS, ANTI-ISRAEL PRO-TERRORIST ELEMENTS OUT THERE.

O167	https://youtu.be/uNpLRiduF8c?si=eQUJR8lrxM5wSf5A	(dramatic music) - [Alexander] These white pouches may be the future of the tobacco industry, but there's no tobacco inside. - The main ingredient inside ZYN's is pure nicotine. - [Alexander] These are ZYN Nicotine Pouches. The oral nicotine product comes in these cans. You may have seen them for sale in convenience stores, gas stations, and even your local pharmacy, or on social media where they've birthed a devoted subculture. - Good morning, boys. Popping a little. - [Alexander] Over the past year,  sales of ZYN have skyrocketed. In the fourth quarter of 2023, 116 million cans were sold in the US, a 78% increase over the same period a year earlier. - ZYN is definitely having a moment. - A pouch packed with problems, - [Alexander] But ZYN's remarkable success has provoked a backlash, and thrust it into the culture war. - Many people see it as a threat. - [Alexander] So what can we learn about ZYN when we test it in a lab, and how transformative a product could ZYN be for the tobacco industry?  (rhythmic music) - Today we're gonna be finding out what's in ZYN. - [Alexander] Ben Katz is an analytical chemist at UC Irvine specializing in mass spectrometry. Outside of his university work, Katz has been testing nicotine pouch products, - [Influencer] What's in the pouch? Spearmint Edition. - [Alexander] And sharing the findings on his TikTok channel, Mass Spec Everything. - Now we're gonna test a Chill, the Winter Green. - [Alexander] Today, Katz is testing six different ZYN flavors. (rhythmic music)  - Alright, so now we're gonna be analyzing the samples on the mass spectrometer. A mass spectrometer is capable of weighing the exact mass of a molecule so that you can determine the composition of the chemical structure and identify what is in a sample. Oh, it works! In the data analysis software, we see a series of peaks. There is a common peak that's in all of the samples, and it's the most abundant peak in all the samples that is our nicotine peak. Based on these tests, nicotine is the bioactive molecule in ZYN,  and the nicotine is the only tobacco-related alkaloid that we can see in this product. - ZYN looks like a little teabag. It's a tiny little white pouch that tucks inside the cheek and inside, there's no tobacco leaf. There is cellulose or wood pulp, along with some artificial sweeteners, and flavorings, and nicotine. - [Alexander] In January, Senator Chuck Schumer called for a federal crackdown on the pouches. - I'm delivering a warning to parents because these nicotine pouches seem to lock their sights on young kids,  teenagers, and even lower, and then use the social media to hook 'em. - [Alexander] This scrutiny has in turn triggered another chapter in America's cultural war with some on the Right declaring a ZYNsurrection Senator Thom Tillis responded on X with a message that said, "Come and take it, Chuck." - So we're gonna make him a ZYN birthday cake. - [Alexander] Fueling ZYN's rise are self-styled Zynfluencers who feature the nicotine pouches in their social media content. ♪ Upper-decky gum pilly's, upper-decky lip cushions. ♪  - [Alexander] Unlike cigarette brands, nicotine pouch brands are permitted to advertise on billboards and television. And unlike E-cigarettes such as JUUL, they're sold in fruity flavors. There are lots of brands of pouches on the market, including Rogue, VELO, and LUCY, but it's ZYN that is emerged as the Kleenex of nicotine pouches. - ZYN is sold by Swedish Match, a Swedish smokeless tobacco company. - [Alexander] In 2022, tobacco giant, Philip Morris International acquired Swedish Match in a $16 billion deal.  Just last year, Philip Morris shipped 385 million ZYN cans in the US, and this year, the company forecasts shipment volumes of about 520 million cans. ZYN now represents 24% of the smokeless category, which includes traditional smokeless tobacco such as Copenhagen, Grizzly, and Skoal. - Nicotine pouches are still in their early days in terms of their share of the overall tobacco market. They still would have a long, long way to go to really take a bite out of cigarettes. - [Alexander] Despite the brand's success,  ZYN's unofficial brand ambassadors have created a headache for ZYN's owner Philip Morris. - The most famous Zynfluencers is Tucker Carlson, the former Fox News host. - ZYN is not a sin. - He is sort of a self-appointed and unofficial ZYN brand spokesman. - [Alexander] In October, Tucker Carlson made unfounded claims that ZYN helps with focus and erectile dysfunction. - ZYN is a powerful work enhancer, and also a male enhancer, if you know what I mean. - Philip Morris has pushed back very hard on these claims,  and has actually sort of asked his team to cease and desist on that. - [Alexander] Philip Morris said, "It has reached out to social media influencers, asking them not to promote ZYN in any form, but the audience includes people under 21." The company said, "Its products are intended for adults who already use nicotine. - Senator Schumer's interest in ZYN, I think is related to his long-standing interest in tobacco control, especially the risk to youths. However, the national data, survey data tells us  that kids are not really using this product at significantly high levels, so there's not really evidence for any kind of epidemic. - [Alexander] A 2023 study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that around 1.5% of middle school and high school students reported using nicotine pouches in the last 30 days. Some public health experts say, "Nicotine pouches like ZYN could save lives by helping adult cigarette smokers switch to a much safer alternative." - Would I consider, you know, recommending ZYN  to friends or family that smoked cigarettes? Yes, I would. We know that smoking is bad, bad, bad for you. - Anecdotally, I've heard from E-cigarette users who have switched over to ZYN, it's very, very hard to detect that someone has a nicotine pouch in their mouth. I've done interviews with folks who would talk to me for half an hour, and I never noticed until at the end of the interview, they would take the pouch out. - [Alexander] According to the FDA, "Nicotine is addictive, but by itself, it doesn't cause cancer or lung disease."  - But we don't really, you know, 100% know what the long-term effects of nicotine use are. However, we do have some pretty good indications from evidence that comes from other parts of the world. So, for example, the country of Sweden is famous for using a product called Swedish Snus. - [Alexander] Snus is a moist, pasteurized, smokeless, oral tobacco product, which is placed under the lip to deliver nicotine through the gums. It's been used by consumers in Sweden since the 1970s. - And this is a product  that's in some ways is similar to ZYN, it's actually the precursor to ZYN, and it's known to be much less toxic compared to other oral tobacco products. - [Alexander] Since Snus pouches were first introduced in Sweden in 1973, smoking rates have fallen considerably. - Sweden now has the lowest smoking rate of all of the European Union countries. They also now have the lowest rates of smoking-related cancer. So that tells me that people who use clean nicotine products are much less likely to develop serious diseases  that we know are related to smoking. - So Schumer asked the FDA to investigate, and the FDA already has been conducting a review of ZYN because all nicotine pouch manufacturers were required to submit their products for FDA review in order to get authorization to keep them on the US market. - [Alexander] If the agency does authorize a nicotine pouch, the authorization might come with marketing and flavor restrictions.

O190	https://youtu.be/XeW0H4PeiJw?si=V9LTOc6EGIpBWEYo	and by the way now you're taking a picture of inappropriate pictures of me because of what i am wearing so guess what now i'm really compliment police on you it's that time of the week again that sacred time of the week where we take a look at the entitled and insane species known as the karen kicking it off today we're going to be taking a look at a karen who threatened to sue someone after being recorded trespassing on their property because as we all know already a karen is just never in the  wrong no matter what they do but without further ado let's check it out i got a phone call from my lawyers dave how'd you come on my property no i didn't i sat in the car you're videotaping me you want a phone call oh your mom saw me across the street and stopped would you like a phone call from my lawyers thank you eliza for coming by steve i'm gonna call i told you once leave me alone they'll come near my home or it's considered harassment and here you are darcy thank you for coming by steve i'm  calling the police on here and i'm calling my lawyer wow i think that might be a first in a karen video instead of calling the manager like your typical run-of-the-mill karen she's taking it a step up a notch and calling her lawyer instead that must be the busiest lawyer in the entire country they're probably getting about 50 phone calls just in the morning alone let's be real there's no way karen has a lawyer i don't think anyone who says that on what seems to be a normal basis is telling the truth her  version of a lawyer is probably her friend who's watched like two episodes of law and order once while half asleep but she is wearing what looks like a law hoodie so maybe she is the lawyer who knows steve i'm calling the calling my police how dare you i'm not online i'm not on your property and by the way now you're taking a picture of an inappropriate pictures thing because of what i am wearing so guess what now i'm really calling the police on you cool you wear it outside and come by my house with the intention  of coming by my house with the intention of it your bolts should know better your bolts should know better guess what now i'm really calling the police on you well i guess this karen isn't that different after all she's dialing 9-1-1 now with about the most caring reason you could think of in this situation inappropriate pictures of her because you know you totally wouldn't have to be wearing something inappropriate in public for someone to be taking these pictures of you for a person who's wearing a law hoodie and  says they know lawyers that's gonna be the stupidest reason she could have come up with here the funny part in all this is that she's fully self-aware of what she's wearing here as well and it's up to think that she could have genuinely ruined this guy's life if he wasn't recording all this also for a little bit of context by the way the person recording in the karen in the video have a little bit of a beef going on and karen has apparently been recently harassing this dude who's now taking it upon himself to record her in  the act you know better come take your sign come take your side of my pr i knew you did it eliza i knew you did it i knew it i knew it the away from me get away from me don't you ever come by my house again stop where you are stop where you are right now don't you come near my house don't i said stop you keep coming closer i will call the police you keep coming close i'll call the police eliza get off my property is this your property get away from me you came over here with the intention of taking  pictures and video of my house i don't give a what you did you came over here intentionally to harass me get the out of here i blocked you get away from me get the away from me get the away from me immediately eliza get away this is out of your realm this is out of your realm i'm not on your property you came to the wrong house eliza the wrong i don't care where you were what i know is a post somehow you can see that i blocked you and you show up at my house to take pictures who are you call the police next time you ain't an  investigator you know goddamn wealth you know the law so well you know what you're doing is wrong i'm not doing anything you know what you're doing it's wrong this right here all over for everybody to see that you go around the people's homes and do what you just did not interested not interested we are on our way to cbs you're on your way to my house you're on the way to my house it came from that road you passed cbs from your house to get here the out of here get the out of here good good when the cops come  i'll be sitting there this is why everyone should always have a hose ready in front of your house i really do wonder what exactly the other karen is saying to the police at the moment also part of me thinks she just happens to own that hoodie and another part of me thinks that she might actually be a law student which if that's the case with 1.5 million views on tick tock i don't know if that's gonna last much longer she's only harassing someone also not to mention the public indecency and of course indecent exposure which i think  we can all agree on all right so i have an update on karen i got a call from the police and as a courtesy they said i'm not doing anything illegal and there's nobody pressing charges but long story short they said that yes she filed the police report to try to pin me to sexual harassment um and her intention which she spread already around her friends was to try to get my you know livelihood taken away based on what i do for a living and with that she called the police this time because she wants the video taken down  and the cops said there's no legal action that can be taken at this point not at least by them and um so they've kindly asked me to take it down just because listen they're going to keep calling the police and calling the police until it comes down so i haven't decided yet if i'm going to because i think at some point everybody has to you know have to be accountable to their actions as of right now the video is still up on tick tock with a juicy 1.5 million views which i think is the right decision  considering these karens are going as far as to call the police accusing this man of sexual harassment when in reality you happen to be wearing i think the smallest size shorts you could find in the kids section of a walmart even if the video gets taken down the damage is already done this is more than enough evidence to use if she actually does go to a lawyer which is not out of the realm of possibility considering she's a karen a stay away from the other people you hear me you just stay in this chair get  the out do that again i'll kick you out myself yeah i just thought i'd throw in this video i had to get my weekly dose of karen's getting owned this right here is a level 100 karen slang master in the flesh you could tell this is just another day in the office for him i feel like every single business needs to have a security guard like this present at all times to slay cairns that would make every place easier and safer for everyone get the out but anyways i think that's gonna wrap up today's video  thanks for watching drop a like if you enjoyed the video stay tuned for some more juicy videos coming soon to the channel and until then stay sexy peace 	Center			Leaning Conservative	174

O256	https://youtu.be/jJVrIUe_0Mc?si=UeVUdHpMKVE6qZOa	Has Joe Biden? Has President Biden reached out to you recently, asked for his support? No. Or your support? He hasn't. - Should he? - It's pretty stupid for him not to. Like when you're running for office, unless the person, like, morally repulses you. And even then, if it's close. No one cares about you. Chris Christie no one cares about you. The idea that it is stupid for Joe Biden not to call Chris Christie and ask for his endorsement. Why? So the four people who supported you during the Republican primaries  might consider voting for Joe Biden. - What was that? - Guys, I'm not joking. I out pulled Chris Christie when I was running for president. We were in the race at the same time and I got more. I had more support as a non natural born citizen than he did, and he was a former governor of new Jersey. - She's genuinely offended. - Yeah. Me too, by the way. Biden hasn't called me. But but guys okay, I, I would at least have enough self-awareness because it's I would not carry myself in the way that he is, where he feels that people owe him something.  Yeah, but I know why. So both you can see it publicly, but I've also seen it at some, venture capital, conferences, etc., where he's vetted, like in New York and DC. They love Chris Christie. They can't get enough of him. Why? He's the prototypical establishment politician. We'll do anything the donors ask him. No muss, no fuss. Right. He's not going to pull a trump and go off the reservation and do things just for himself. He's going to get the normal enrichment that he gets from corruption, etc.  He's going to do everything that the donors ask him. He's uni party all the way. So they love him and he's anti-Trump. Oh, he's perfect. He's perfect. Right. So that's rich folks, donors, media people, other politicians. Since they all adore Chris Christie. He says that because they tell him all the time how great he is, so he believes it. Oh, that's so sad. And secondly, he thinks, and he's right about this, that that elite circle in DC will think, oh, that is outrageous. How come Joe Biden hasn't called Chris Christie, a moderate Republican who is in  favor of all the same corporate tax cuts and giveaways that we are, and begged him for his support? Yeah, he should do that right away. Pausing here to deliver some honest truth, as we do in our news coverage as well. TYT is facing challenges, guys, as the entire industry is. You know who could make the difference? You. If you hit the join button below, it's going to make all the difference and keep us in business. We appreciate you. Thank you. This is a good rule of thumb, and I think most people operate this way anyway.  Most normal people, right? The normies, don't walk through life expecting others to owe you things. Right? Walk through life feeling that no one owes you a damn thing because that's the reality. Okay, so that's what kind of I wouldn't even say irritated me. I just find it laughable. I mean, it was hilarious what he just said, but why don't we hear more of what he had to say? He's speaking to Leanne Caldwell. And this was an interview that took place yesterday. President Bush, 43, one time said to me when I was running for governor the first  time, he called to give me advice, and he said to me, one last thing, buddy. Remember, ask for the vote. You know, you show in front of these groups, they all think. You think, well, they know I want their vote. People like to be asked, look at them and say, I want your vote. Ask for the vote. If this were George W Bush, man, my phone would have rung five minutes after I got out of the race. I have to believe it's philosophical with his staff, and they don't want to go there because they're concerned about the far left.  Well, God, what if we, you know, go and ask for support from an anti-Christ like a Republican? We need to be working together. And it would be a smart thing for Biden to do. But yes, so far no. And I know the. Invitation is open. And I know he's got my number because right after he was elected, I said some positive things on ABC and I got in the car to head back to new Jersey, and he called me and said, I listened to what you said. Thank you so much important for Republicans to be saying that. So he's got the number. I haven't changed it.  Just have some self respect, bro. Like a little bit of self respect. This is so no one cares about you Chris Christie. No one. You want to know who endorsed Biden in 2020? Wall to wall neocons. Wall to wall neocons endorsed Biden. Okay. Those neocons got absorbed into the Democratic Party. By the way, did leftists or progressives lose their minds over that? No. The reason Biden's not calling you because he's afraid of leftists or progressives, he's not calling you because he doesn't care about you, Chris Christie,  he doesn't think that you're influential. Accept it. And once you accept it, I think you'll live a better life. That self-awareness is a good thing. Yeah. Besides which, which progressives are fighting biting and Biden in Washington that they would bother fighting him over Chris Christie. They didn't fight him over paid family leave not being included, public public option not being proposed. They didn't fight him over minimum wage or voting rights. They're going to fight him over not calling or calling Chris Christie.  I think I think what he's referring to is the voters that, you know, voters who are further on the left would be upset if someone like Chris Christie endorses Biden after Biden gives him a call and kisses what kisses his butt? Yeah, I presumably look, Anna, you're right on two counts. One, he's flattering himself. No one is going to be animated enough to care to to be mad at Biden over that. Number two, you're totally right that everybody knows, like in the progressive sphere, not in the whole Democratic Party or the whole country,  but in our section of the populist left. Everyone knows Joe Biden is a Republican lite like he is. Like, I bet his opinion like his policies from Chris Christie's like five, 10% difference, almost no difference at all. So nobody's going to get upset. Oh, I can't believe you agree with the same policies that you have. Of course he does. Joe Manchin, Chris Christie, Joe Biden, their policies are nearly indistinguishable. Okay. So now, to your point about the entitlement complex, just real quick. I never once.  I didn't think about it until this story when I said I out pulled him and he remember he's on the Republican side. I'm on the Democratic side. And I got the equivalent in polling about 1.6 million voters, voters on the Democratic side saying, I'd like to vote for this brother, even though he wasn't born in the country. And it never even occurred to me that Biden would call me, even though those are voters he desperately needs, because I don't have an entitlement complex, whereas Chris Christie thinks I am owed everything.  Last thing, which is hilarious. I bet Biden calls him now because that's how weak he is. Look, if Biden does that Biden, you should have some self respect. - Like, no, he doesn't. - Have any self respect at all. - Well that's. - True. That's definitely been demonstrated time and time again. But I do want to go to one more video because in this next one he's specifically asked point blank, you know, he's not supportive of Donald Trump, clearly. I mean, he's been very critical of Donald Trump. So does that mean that he's supportive of Joe Biden as, the current president  who should get reelected? Let's watch. - Would you vote for Biden? - I don't think so. Now RFK Jr. No, look, right now. Look, things can change because campaigns matter. The one thing I know for sure now is I'm not voting for Trump under any circumstances. If he's the only person on the ballot, I'm not voting for Trump. But President Biden, in my view, is past his sell by date. I right now, I couldn't say to myself, I think Joe Biden is capable of being president today, let alone at 86. I mean, everybody take a breath.  He's going to be four years older. He it's not like they say to you when you get past 85, okay? You only have to be present in three days a week. You go to Delaware the rest of the time, take time off. No president is 24 hours a day, seven days a week. And I don't believe the man's up to it. I think Chris Christie is going to write his own name in. He's not going to vote for Biden, not going to vote for Trump, not going to vote for RFK Jr. Who are you going to vote for? Then? You're going to write your name in?  No. Jill Stein. No. That's a great point. I bet he does. That's the kind of egomaniac he is. By the way, what's also telling about politics is if Biden had called him, he wouldn't have said any of those things. Yep. That's how greasy politicians are.

performance yes number 20 Wen Phoenix today wiin Phoenix is a multi time Oscar nominee and winner but in 2009 his career was in a very different realm after appearing  on The Late Show with David Letterman is there something wrong I can't be the first one to make you feel weird about it no I guess not wearing sunglasses and a big bushy beard Phoenix mumbled awkwardly through the discussion causing the host to take verbal shots at him what uh what can you tell us about your days with the unibomber while this turned out to be a spook for his mockumentary I'm still here the media genuinely believed Phoenix was having a breakdown and producers stayed away from him but you you are you're not going to  act anymore no huh why is that I don't know the actor admitted in a later interview that

doing the best that I can and doing it in a way that I feel is is Right an erratic Cru doubled down on his anti Psychiatry views calling it a quote pseudo science and I know that uh Psychiatry is is a pseudo science his very patronizing approach did Cruise no favors as he combed Low's questions with  all the Scandal Paramount Pictures cut ties with the actor in 2006 after 14 years but eventually that relationship recovered Steven Spielberg also denounced Cruz's actions in 2005 however the duo reconciled in 2023 we've never seen you behave this way before I know have you ever felt this way

lack of attention and called  him a quote terrible interviewer I mean you can't even pay attention for 60 seconds you're a terrible interviewer well you just weren't keeping my attention that's not my

troubles he said that after finding out he walked the streets looking for trouble hoping to kill a black man before realizing that what he was doing was wrong and feeling ashamed of himself many branded him a racist While others defended his honesty including celebrities such as Trevor Noah and whoopy Goldberg because I believe that Liam n deserves a medal and I'll tell you why it may not have destroyed his career but it certainly put a fork in the road of his likability number 14 John Mayer at one point John Mayer had  the reputation of a quality musician who was seemingly going to reach legendary status one day but then he spoke to Playboy magazine in 2010 and destroyed that possibility he is giving this interview to Playboy magazine he wants to be provocative and he tried a little too hard on top of being gross about his past relationships with Jessica Simpson and Jennifer Aniston sexually it was crazy mayor compared quote little John to white supremacist David Duke and

wedding yikes as the backlash grew Dean was interviewed on The Today Show to discuss the controversy and it was weird if there's anyone out there that has never said something they they wish they

ology video she'd made afterward more companies cut ties with Dean as she fell Into Obscurity number 11 Michael Jackson  interviewed by Martin Basher for a year and broadcast to the world in 2003 the documentary living with Michael Jackson shocked viewers with a couple of massive Revelations from the singer these we bought yes and these yes this table these these firstly Jack spoke about the abuse

bankruptcy from other lawsuits before he passed away in 2009 black people were called colored people because we come in all colors from very white as white as  my hand to very dark number 10 Lance Armstrong seen as a hero for facing cancer and becoming a dominant force in professional cycling Lance Armstrong was beloved and one of the best athletes ever but then the rumors that he had had all

contracts with him reportedly costing armst strong millions of dollars did you ever use any other baned substances like testosterone uh cortisone or human growth hormone yes number nine Billy Bush while not an official interview  person say we're going to allow this Access Hollywood footage due to how notorious and career ruining it became it was actually captured before presenter Billy Bush and Donald Trump were able to cruise into a TV studio to do some filming and while they were unaware that their microphones were on I moved on her actually you know she was down on Palm Beach I moved on her and I failed I'll admit it I did try she was married s while on the bus they riff about Trump's sexual escapades which in include groping women and discuss how  power can give you free reign to do whatever you want I better use some Tic Tacs just in case they start kissing her you know I'm automatically attracted to beautiful I just start kissing them it's like a magnet you just kiss I don't even way and when you're a star they let you do it you can do anything whatever you want grab them by the we even hear them talking about how attractive they think Days of Our Lives actress Arian Zucker is before meeting her when they get off the bus Bush was suspended from his job  on the Today Show following a ratings drop and subsequently resigned he since had to repeatedly defend himself in interviews the moment that is on that tape I understand people's reaction I agree I also felt that way number eight 5 Seconds of Summer if you're a ban being interviewed by Rolling Stone magazine is a big big deal so much so that it can be easy to get carried away with trying to sound overtly rock and roll and that's exactly what happened with the band 5 Seconds of Summer in a 2015 interview the band did everything  from compare themselves to The Beatles to dismissing or insulting the American Music Awards Justin Bieber and their female fan base also known as most of their fan base they were criticized for their comments and for generally sounding like narcissistic Pradas it probably didn't help that they appeared naked on the front cover either number seven Paula Abdul what do Idol fans have to look forward to this season and what are you looking forward to seeing well is that what it is I was wondering what  is that you know when you're under the influence but you don't think you sound like you are well there's a good chance that Paula Abdul knows what that feels like at least in hindsight in this 2007 interview she's promoting the latest series of American Idol while she would later dismiss the idea as lies many viewers wondered if she'd had a few drinks or partaken in another type of stimuli delayed responses bouts of laughter this one has it all you know what they said listen any publicity is good publicity you got to learn to eat  it up and and embrace it and say Seattle had the best delusional people the interview went viral becoming an inescapable part of Abdul's career 2 years later she left American Idol as a judge due to a dispute over wages and dropped out of the public eye for a while number six the chain smokers next up we have another misguided attempt at sounding hardcore in a magazine interview this time courtesy of the musical Duo the chain smokers who let it all hang out with billboard everyone was making the same thing and after a few  years it got really stale and only a few people started breaking off from that and experimenting when asked about their manic musical romps they were all too eager to brag about their wild frat boy image and pensent for sleeping with as many girls as possible even though they both had girlfriends the two were heavily criticized and briefly became became the talk of the musical world for all the wrong reasons but we shouldn't hate on them too much right like they said quote we're just frat Boro dudes  you know what I mean loving ladies and stuff that's an actual quote word for word number five prince Andrew deemed a car crash by many this interview ultimately resulted in prince Andrew stepping down from public duties for the royal family today you've chosen to speak out for the first time why have you decided to talk now when BBC's Emily matless questioned him about his close ties to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein the prince's answer raised many an eyebrow for starters prince Andrew straight up denied ever meeting his  accuser Virginia Roberts I have no recollection of ever meeting this lady none whatsoever despite photographic evidence to the contrary there were other shocking answers littered throughout like saying he didn't regret his friendship with Epstein as it presented him with useful opportunities the interviewer is clearly impressed with his answers much like pretty much everyone else who watched it he has quite obviously conducted himself in a manner Unbecoming yes Unbecoming he was a sex offender yeah I'm sorry I'm being polite  number four Katherine hagall higel has long had a reputation for being difficult to work with but a 2008 interview with Vanity Fair proved particularly damning when she criticized the movie Knocked Up which she just start in she branded the movie quote a little sexist and critiqued the the way in which it portrays women which frustrated people considering that she decided to be in the movie A year later she starred in the movie The Ugly Truth which was widely panned as misogynistic who's this delightful  creature I'm your producer hey I like it when on top as a result of the entire episode already hesitant directors were given yet another reason to be cautious about working with her I'm going to be really honest right now I'm not I know I'm not I don't have to think about it I'm not a rude person I'm not an unkind or mean person number three Megan Fox as a general rule it's probably not a good idea to compare the director you're working with to Hitler but that's what Transformers star Megan Fox did in an interview with British  magazine Wonderland talking about Michael Ba's conduct on set Fox compared the director to the Nazi leader which was soon all over the media wa nice headers you've got a high-rise double pump carburetor that's pretty impressive soon double Pump It ultimately resulted in her being fired from the Transformers franchise but not by ba according to ba it was the franchise's executive producer a certain Steven Spielberg who insisted she be fired she's since worked with ba again on the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles films which the latter  produced but Fox's notable roles have otherwise been few and far between since giving this interview hi guys this is April O'Neal from Channel 6 news and I am here in beautiful New York City on the first day of spring and you know what that means it is time to shed that pesky winter weight number two Charlie Sheen this guy has said and done some seriously shocking and controversial things in his career but the reason he's on today's list may surprise you the interview in question is his 2015 appearance on the Today Show where he  announced that he was HIV positive they walked in the room and said boom here's what's going on it's it's it's it's it's a hard um three letters to absorb you know it's a it's it's it's it's a turning in in in one's life while some praised his bravery many criticized the fact that it had taken him 4 years to go public with it stating that it could have endangered his sexual partners were these people that you had had sexual contact with and were claiming that you had transmitted the virus to them or were  these people who simply found out about your status and were threatening to tell the world people also took aim at Sheen's surprisingly calm demeanor as he told of his diagnosis and battle with people blackmailing him for some the interview humanized Sheen more than ever before for others it further solidified his reputation as being Reckless particularly with the lives of others have you had unprotected sex on any occasion since you're diagnosis yes but but the two people that that that I did that with um were  under the care of my doctor and and they

however an interview about the allegations ensured that Kelly's mudded reputation would not be forgotten when asked about whether he liked teenage girls Kelly replied with this when you say Teenage

physically aggressive towards him in the past although he claims that he did not retaliate based on the information provided by the man it appears that the root cause of their altercation lies with

woman momentarily appears to have calmed down an officer attempts to explain to her that in cases of domestic issues law enforcement is authorized to enter her residence and conduct an investigation however she remains steadfast in her belief that she has done nothing wrong it's a domestic related issue but he does not have right to search my things or my home without my because you have kids here we have to  check their wellbeing that's great he's alive he's and that's the reason why we went in the room to go check so he's also opening my things he does have a right to do that if you are Cooperative with us I am cooperating I'm just saying why does he need to go through my things then that has nothing to do with the domestic dist servant that has nothing to do with my child can he

in her house steps outside there he encounters  the neighbor and questions him about his continued presence want to make sure her kids are going to be all right yeah as a matter of fact you know when they're going to come back from wherever they are and stuff like that uh I need to know if the the she's going to be here for them and stuff or anybody's going to be here yes she's going to be here for them she's she's not going to jail all she's going to get is a ticket okay okay okay so thank you yeah her her boy's going to be okay it's not just her boy she's got two  girls here she's going to be here when her other two children get in the other officer who was questioning the female then inquires about the whereabouts of her ex's bike initially she does not respond but eventually provides the necessary information enabling another officer to retrieve the bike uh Valerie ell I am getting return unnown an officer found the bike the female finally becomes calm enough to share her own side of the story she explains that the male owed her money as well as unpaid child support for their  child in response she decided to hold on to the bike until he fulfilled his financial obligations while her explanation seemed reasonable the condition of her room necessitated a report to Child Protective Services okay those cops are going to come off I'm not going to do anything crazy on my children once we're done Valerie okay for right now they're gonna stay on okay I just need to get a little more information I need to get you have two girls and a boy right I really I just need to get their names date of births  why do you need that they're not involved in this case I need it cuz they're in the household is CPS being called anybody who's in the households anybody who's in the household S I heard you I heard you I asked you a question though I'm not ignoring yours but I asked you a question okay are you calling CPS we're just making a report it's it's for the but are you reporting this and yes ma' I am thank you that's all I needed can I get can let's start with the boy they already have all their names okay well I need it Jackson I  would like to know officer real quick um what you are reporting accusational wise to CPS please uh reference to a domestic disturbance and so what is that conclude with CPS I guess does that open a whole case just for their information to them really up to them okay thanks that's no I appreciate I just need to know yeah just need to know is it net with two T's Double T ultimately the email is issued a citation instead of being arrested with charges including battery against her household member and resisting and  obstructing arrest after she's released from the handcuffs the officers depart from the scene that was exactly how I felt and it would not have happened that way so please maybe next time just take down the cop back attitude because it would have gone a lot differently I don't I would have worked I was not mad at you but I did not appreciate how I felt approach okay well so it can I'm a very reasonable person the next time the police respond especially in reference to a domestic disturbance isn't even a  domestic disturbance he's a pansy so why am I getting a ticket so you're getting a ticket for resisting evading or obstructing an alcer during uh an investigation okay I would like to understand how it was restricting anything yeah so we can argue this in no I'm not I'm not arguing I just I'm I'm talking I'm just saying I'd like to understand I'm autistic so my brain is just works a little bit differently I'm really just trying to understand what I'm asking questions I just want to see what I think I don't  know how I did wrong or what I did to resist so I just need to be told so I understand that's why I'm trying to explain to you is the next time the police officers arrive in reference to any kind of Investigation especially when trying to make sure that everybody's okay and the well-being of everybody involved making sure that nobody gets hurt especially when children are involved okay you need to cooperate that's it the same way right now I did go I just was a little Hy I was I felt threatened  okay can you understand as a mama bear I felt threatened and that's really where it was I have this man who's knocked me up and Li and abused me and my children and I just want it paid right so you got really close to me and I could smell the alcohol so I'm sure the alcohol had something to do with it now in regards to the children I see that your house is a mess

a woman in Sparta Wisconsin prior to reaching the scene dispatch relayed that the woman  identified as 20-year-old Nicole Campton had reportedly grabbed the man by the throat and tore his shirt when

O323	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stJMYycQuRE	he's my president I'm with him 100% he's anointed by God to lead this country and this world God talks to me and he SPS to me in a language I understand so like what does it sound like he sounds different to each person cuz what does he sound like to you I'm from Brooklyn he sounds like Brooklyn he talks to me like I'm from Brooklyn you see all sorts of cool stuff at Trump rallies like there's a license plate that says God family country and then on the side of it it's got the Confederate flag so I'm  not sure which country they're talking about it's a book that we've seen that's in libraries and lots of schools that features a story of uh two daughters having sex with their dad oh wow they get their dad drunk to have sex with him and this is like a book my should a book like that be in a school no no no just get that out of the school ABS why do kids need to read that that book is actually the Bible oh no no no no you know you seriously can't make this stuff up for decades now the right wing  has hijacked and bastardized Christianity for its own political goals infecting multiple generations of Americans across the country do you think the Bible is a pro-life book yes absolutely and uh what about in Leviticus when God tells people to kill someone if they're gay um there you have it God created life didn't God kill everybody on earth except for Noah and and some farm animals on an arc I'm sorry didn't God kill everybody on earth now seeing these zealots having their own supposed religious views  thrown back in their faces it is satisfying for a multitude of reasons but what shouldn't be lost is the true political power and danger these people pose if they get into a position to wield said political power country needs to turn back to God I think we bring God back into this country put it place it back in our schools place it back in our courts am I correct in saying that you're not a constitutionalist then I am a constitutionalist but I believe that the constitution has been Twisted to fit uh certain perspectives  well it's just that the separation between church and state is a pretty important thing so it sounds like you want church and state to kind of go back together sure do you think God needs to be back in government um yes our government was based on it right God We Trust is on our money so you know one of the amendments in the Constitution uh says that you know there will be a separation between church and state a lot of people are saying they want to see more Church in state I do I think so so certain parts of the  Constitution take it or leave it yeah yeah so um I I believe fully in the Constitution now this is the Crux of the Republican party's co-opting of American Evangelical Christianity eroding the constitutionally protected separation of church and State as a means to achieve their policy goals under the guise of acting out God's will or following the teachings of the Bible or any other bogus excuse for their bigotry do you think this should be a Christian country oh I do I do we were founded on God  and Democrats are taking them away taking them out of the school how about reconciling separation of church and state which we were founded on I don't think that's right I do not think that's right they should have never did that why would you take something as beautiful as America that we founded God on WE founded America on God and why would you try to destroy that and take it out of the schools and try to teach our children something that's that's what I mean about separation of church and state that's is it shouldn't be though  God should be we should be able to say in Jesus name you know and I I don't care what what religion you are because if we unite and come together as all in one they'll find the true God you come to this country accept our beliefs accept what we are accept who we are or don't come and that's not to be mean it's just to say don't come here and try to change our country to your beliefs that's what I see them trying to do you're trying to force something down our throat that we don't want we'll welcome you here we'll  welcome you with open arms come here and embrace America but don't try to make America to the Middle East they want to embrace um Islam and and make that make that more mainstream they have right like I said they have right their language anybody I it's not just Islamic it's any any religion if you want to come here and practice it you have that right there's mosques there's different things but don't try to say that the country that was founded on judeo Christian beliefs can't believe those beliefs I mean I  know we our uh country of Freedom here but I am very very strong and for this becoming a Christian Nation separation of church and state of foundation of the United States uh and and you know that we have people here who are Muslim and Jewish and Catholic and Buddhist and atheist what do we do about that if we're one nation well I don't support those religions I do believe in my heart that Christianity is the True Religion but we do have freedom in this country that even includes to worship whoever  we're going to worship I don't agree with those other false religions but but hey this is a free country and people can do whatever whatever they choose to do what they ought and you like that freedom nonetheless well yes and no because I being a Christian I don't support false gods or anything like that but what one thing I do support is America's freedom and just about every other way all of the folks you just saw are textbook cases of equality feeling like oppression even though there is literally no threat to their abilities  to freely practice Christianity The increased infusion of right-wing politics into their religious beliefs has created this false sense of paranoia in the community that they have a Target on their backs and thus must protect themselves which is all by Design this kind of manipulation can only succeed when fear is the vehicle fear makes equality feel like oppression to a dominant social group who was indoctrinated to believe that simply allowing someone else just a little more opportunity will mean the end of life as  they know it when in reality allowing everyone to share in Hope and opportunity well that lifts our entire Society it also probably gives us all a better chance at living in peace but 	Leaning Conservative			Liberal	185

after that last video and said hey I'm going to take BJ to uh to North Carolina and I he wanted 700 bucks I said as long as you you're taking your daughter to North Carolina to get her away from your family then I can continue my relationship with you guys right but I don't want to be part of you  guys if everyone's lying to me and lar goes yeah I'm going to take her tonight so he needed 700 bucks

O332	https://youtu.be/huvStjScFvM?si=0igfmxqDcCjIHox9	well hey B it's Jamie D me here welcome back to the channel honey listen I want to get into some things and what I want to talk about is this teacher over on Tik Tok who has his students taking down his braids I guess he has a hair appointment of some sort and I want to get into it um I've been saying it swarm all around social media but I have not actually gotten a chance to really check it out wholeheartedly so we're about to do that together okay make sure that you guys are indeed coming into the video  you are liking up the channel okay subscribing to the channel as well if you're not subscribed and make sure that you're cutting on your notification Bells okay so without further Ado let us go ahead and hop into this video to see exactly what uh this teacher has to say about this um let's check it out stream my students helping me take my hair out there was quite the discourse in the chat which had people saying this was inappropriate and other people saying this was completely fine there was nothing wrong with what I was doing and  people were just making it weird so of course I had to bring this issue to the big stage I would like to represent myself in this case your honor if I may number one for little context I had a hair appointment immediately after school and I needed my hair taken out beforehand I would have taken it out the night before but that Friday we had a camera crew coming in to shoot a promotional video and I was one of the ones being interviewed so I had to look presentable so I didn't take my hair out I didn't have the time to do it  all myself cuz it would have taken me forever so naturally I asked about four or five of my over over a 100 best friends to assist me in taking my hair out and they all agreed number two this was at the end of class this week we were doing stem fair presentations since it was Friday and all of my students did an excellent job on their stem fair projects and presentations I told them if we get one solid presentation in this class I'll end class a little early and they can have fun and play basketball  darts or be on their phones or whatever and during that time my team would help me take my hair out a couple of these were students from my class but others were students from other classes I would all of them a pass at the beginning of the class period requesting their assistance 10 minutes before dismissal I told the teachers only send them if all of their work was completed and they had good behavior they all met the criteria so 10 minutes before dismissal they showed up for their job my next point I  like to make is if I was a female teacher those people wouldn't be in the comments saying oh this is weird this is inappropriate cuz me personally I don't think there's anything weird about this people are saying oh that's too intimate to me it's literally just hair it doesn't have to be weird some people have never had cool teachers in the shows I personally believe that building authentic relationships with students is Paramount in being an Effective Teacher I make sure my students know and can  feel that I care about them beyond the schoolwork and all the stuff that I have to make them do I take the time to get to know my students outside of academics because caring for the whole child is what's important some of these students have been with me since I was was a substitute 4 years ago they see me as a big brother or a father figure as some of them say and me I don't want kids of my own so all of these kids are literally my children and in case you're wondering about their parents most of  them follow me on social media and always talk about my videos with their kids they always tell me that they're so grateful that their kids have someone like me in their life and my admin they're well aware of my social media presence and they love my videos to me this is just another wholesome moment that I'm having with my kids that I was fortunate enough to catch on film since I'm a science teacher one thing that I teach my students about is symbiosis symbiosis deals with the relationships between organisms the type of  relationship that I like to Foster in my class is mutualism or mutualistic relationship which means both organisms benefit from The Exchange so when my students have good behavior complete all their assignments and do everything that a scholar is supposed to do I reward them with downtime and just time to just be a kid be on their phones play games gossip so on and so forth my students and I work hard and we play harder I'm fortunate enough to have students that feel safe and comfortable around me safe  to come to me with their problems their frustrations they come to me seeking guidance and wisdom or come to me simply to chill and hang out because they know that they have a safe space to be themselves around me what I strive to do as an educator is be the teacher I wish I had grown up I strive to be the teacher that makes my inner child happy someone that my inner child would be proud of I want to be the teacher that my students reflect back on 20 30 years down the line and think like dang that  teacher I had in middle school he was the no further questions your honor so let me know your thoughts in the comments you think this was inappropriate or people are making something out of nothing and although you are entitled to your opinion all I ask is that you be resp respectful thank you all right so y'all just got a chance to check out that video and you know when I first saw it um my initial thought was like oh this is so inappropriate like what the hell does he think he doing and you know after I  listened to this video just now um nothing has changed I still feel the same goddamn way I felt the first time you could play however much classical music you want to play and talk as soft as you want to talk but in my personal this is uh inappropriate um I feel like everything that he said he was on point with um you know the relationships between students and teachers but then also when you allow students to get this comfortable in spaces it could lead to inappropriate behavior or misunderstandings of some sort um in my  personal and you know he talks about you know I feel like a lot of you people may have never had a cool teacher and I understand that but then at the same time a lot of people have had cool teachers in the school and a lot of times not all but quite a bit of the times those cool teachers have been caught up in rumors of them doing inappropriate things with students so why would you want to put yourself in a position for that to possibly happen where somebody could put these allegations out there on you and then  some of the videos like this they use against you in court at some point you know what I'm saying um and you know how one would set it up you know in court or whatever they can all easily turn a simple video as a lot of people may view it like this one into something that's extremely like salacious or whatever we see it all the time with media but um yeah I I I'm just I understood what he was saying and it was really the soft classical music and you listening and it's like okay I see what you're saying but no my dog  like that's still inappropriate um to me I just can't and I'm not going to let my child take nobody hair down especially a stranger if you ain't going to pay like run my kid their coins what this supposed to be for extra credit or some something or something like what is we why what was the purpose of even filming this and putting this off on social media and see the other thing for me is it's the students identity what if I'm a parent who don't post my child on social media and what if I'm trying to you know  conceal the school that my child goes to and you're over here putting them on display on social media like I kind of feel way about that you know even though he tried to you know answer that too and say most of my students or some of my students parents know that I put them on social media yeah I hear you say that but do we know that those children's parents know that you put them on social media you see what I'm saying um I probably would have felt the way if I would have saw that video and that was  my child in the video like what the like explain this situ why you got my child taking your hair down like what is that about you ain't give me no call ahead of time I understand it was like at the last few minutes of class and these are some of the good students some of my best students are the ones that I had come and they were so great in school they were so fantastic that I chose them to take my hair down like m I feel like that's still giving a bit of tacky in my personal I do feel like um  in my personal it was just it was inappropriate I understand that you're on crunch time and I understand that you have a hair appointment and things that you need to get done but I also feel like you should have did it yourself okay I hate to say it like I mean or just pay a five pay the five if you can afford to pay the five pay the five and just have somebody just had a person take your hair down on you get there to get your hair done you know um it did you know as I I mean to me it did kind of look a bit innocent as  I'm watching and I'm listening to him talk you know um but at the same time as innocent as it may have seem with the young ladies taking the hair down it still seemed a bit inappropriate especially for you to want to film it for social media and put them on display like that's my biggest thing like what if somebody's trying not to let everybody know what school they child attends and you got they ass all on social media like did you get clearance for that was there a letter that sent that was sent home for the parents that  was an approval of oh hey um can we get your permission you know sometimes what we like to do is we like to film um you know Tik toks and just want to get your approval that it's okay for your child to be filmed on Tik Tok like I ain't like that um and then another thing he said that a lot of my students see me as a big brother this that that and the other um that's a lot that's not all you don't know how those kids may see you you know a lot of times I do feel like you have older people teachers and stuff  who are just trying to be kind to you know the students or whatnot and they may take that kindness in a different type of way it's been plenty of times I know when I was in school around their age I would hear some of my friends and others have a crush on one of the handsome teachers in school or whatever not that the teacher will ever cross the line with them but you know doing little stuff like this make them feel like oh I probably got a chance or whatever ain't no telling what's going on with these  people heads so in these in these kids heads I just feel like when it's a situation like this in my personal I just um let's lower these type of conversations from happening by not engaging in this type of stuff I mean you know that's just like I just I don't know y'all I I mean I understand how people want to water it down and say oh you know it's just hair it's really not that big of a deal like it's not that deep but as soon as y'all come out with something soon as something happen or pop off y'all will be using this very  video as a reference to explain said person's poor Behavior you know what I'm saying like y'all should have known when y'all saw this D if this man got caught up in some stuff in the past or anything in the future this is going to be a video used to reference any allegations like you know and then I feel like I know you're trying to be you know a great person to these students a teacher that cares about them outside of school and all of that and I get that and I do think we need teachers like that but at  the same time I feel like if you're if you got them taking your hair down in class what other things do you have them doing that makes them feel a bit too comfortable to where if it came down to a situation of getting themselves or or you out of trouble they'll like they may just throw some allegations out there on you and then now you're having to defend yourself like I just yeah I can't let it fly for me you know I mean but if that's what everybody else feels and that's how y'all Rock like it's not that deep it's just hair  and if you people that are saying it's just hair have children and you feel like you'll be okay with then cool um if you're a person that probably don't have no kids and you looking at it like hey you know um I think nothing's wrong with that well then maybe when you have your child you might feel the same or you might feel differently I know me as a parent I don't want no like that okay I don't want my child taking your hair down okay I feel like you can be a friend to a student and also have clear  clear lines for them to know that I'm your teacher okay don't get too friendly with me think you going to come over here and take my hair down or none of that like it's a way to be cool and then it's also a way to you know draw the line just like you know as being a parent knowing that you are you know in a position of authority but also at the same time like not being too um I guess uh I don't want to say harsh but harsh of a lack of lack of better word not being too distant with your kid that  they can't have honest conversations with you and all of that so it's just like really I I just I for me as a parent I would not want my child taking down a teacher's hair uh male or female okay um son or daughter meaning teacher meaning whether the teacher is a woman whether the teacher is a man whether my child is a girl but what I don't want them participating in that and I damn sure don't want nobody putting my child on social media as you're sitting there what it looks like your School logo on  it so people know like I mean I think that's my biggest issue and that's crazy because it's really bigger than them taking down the hair in a sense it's like like how you know these parents really want their child on camera and then it being on display where they child go to school at like I don't know I don't really like this but I'm going let y'all do what y'all want to do cuz y'all going to do it do that anyway cuz how y'all is hello but y'all leave y thoughts in comments down below and let me know whether you felt like it was  that big of a deal whether you felt like it wasn't a big that big of a deal and keep in mind this my personal my personal ain't your personal okay and that's okay don't be trying to attack me girl for my personal cuz I don't see stuff the way that you do understand and I'm probably never going to see it the same way but that's just where we at all right so you guys leave your thoughts and comments down below I'm Jamie that's me uh follow me on Instagram and Twitter at Jamie that's me and I will catch you  guys in the next one bye-bye my city

P50	https://youtu.be/_TCLWsnVztA?si=DCh1l3VPeIhcYNZg	- 'Sup, you beautiful bastards. You're watching "The Philip DeFranco Show." I hope you had a fantastic Thursday afternoon, Friday morning, and I'm glad you're here 'cause we have a lot of news to talk about today, so let's just jump into it, starting with OJ Simpson is dead at the age of 76, or as the Drudge Report put it, "Cancer Murders OJ," which, yeah, I was unaware the guy even had cancer, but as you might expect, most of the reaction online has been either rejoicing or joking, with, for example, Satan tweeting,  "OJ Simpson just arrived down here, what the fuck?" People asking Satan, "Can you ask him who killed his wife?" which Satan said he's waiting for his lawyer to get down here before he answers, which surprised some 'cause they thought that at least one of them was already down there. Let's see, other top comments, "Gone too late," "RIP, I know he's looking up at us right now," "Finally, OJ can rest knowing his wife's killer is dead," though this, is there are also people that are disgusted by people leaving those comments, but all I can really say  with this news is that I hope that the families of Nicole Brown and Ronald Goldman, that they have some peace today, and then, let's play a little game called ♪ Out of touch or bad at math ♪ with this week's contestant being Fox News host, Jesse Watters, because as you might have seen this week, he had a take that went very viral because he was on a podcast responding to the news that California just raised the minimum wage for fast food workers to $20 an hour, which, if you're unfamiliar with the move,  it applies to limited-service restaurant chains with at least 60 locations nationwide. Of course, this as unaffected businesses are still probably gonna feel pressure to raise their own wages to compete for labor, and all that as the general statewide minimum wage in California is $16, and with this news, we saw a lot of different reactions, with a lot on the left celebrating the reforms as a victory for workers' rights, with supporters saying it's the least California could do to help people with the rising cost of living,  and it should actually do even more, but this, as you have a number of people on the right saying, "No, employers are now gonna have no choice but to either lay off staff and/or raise prices or even go out of business." And among those not happy with the move was Jesse Watters, who said that fast food workers simply don't deserve that money, and to try to make his point, he decided, "Hey, why don't I try to do some math?" And if you haven't already seen this clip, let's test it out with you as well.  When I tell you that fast food workers are gonna be making $20 an hour, how much do you think that is as far as a yearly wage? What is their yearly salary? I'm giving you three, two, one, here's Jesse Watters' take. - You're very good at math, so see if you can do this in your head. You probably can. If you're making $20 an hour to work at a fast food restaurant, right? Is that six figures? Are you making- - No. - No, no. - 40 grand, 40 grand. - 50 is just 2X it, and add a few zeroes. - Okay, so-  - [Patrick] 40K a year. - And so Jesse Boy, a little off, like in the same way as if a guy said he was rocking 10 inches but only had four, but then Jesse, he goes, "You know, I know how I can save face here. I'm gonna jump from an individual worker to a family of fast food workers." And so he took a second swing at math. - So, and then if your husband or wife is also there, you're making $100,000 as a family. - Sure. - Both working at McDonald's? - 80 grand. - Yes. - That is, okay, that's crazy.  - My man fucked up 40 times 2. Why do we have, why have we lifted so many unserious people to serious positions? Yeah, even two workers making $20 an hour do not approach six-figure incomes, and that's without mentioning taxes, but for Jesse, him being wrong back to back, that's not the point here. He still says it's still too much. - That is crazy because that job really doesn't require much. - And so with those moments going viral, unsurprisingly, we saw those on the left skewering him. - Working in fast food is incredibly difficult.  It is taxing to your body. - [Host] Yeah. - To your soul when you're dealing with customers all day long. Looking down at workers, people who wanna make an honest living, and demanding that they get paid less for their work is just incredibly gross. - That's insane, what does your job require, you (censored) asshole. You don't do anything. You just sit there, sexually harass the (censored) staffers, and just read whatever your (censored) producers wrote on a teleprompter, you (censored) donkey.  How much does Jesse Watters make? I'm gonna look this up right now. Let's take a look, let's figure it out. Jesse Watters' salary. $5 million a year. - You know, with all that, especially 'cause so many different people in so many different places, they watch this show, I gotta ask you, what are your thoughts here, and understandably, there's two stories. One, I mean what are your thoughts on Jesse Watters just making an ass of himself trying to do math, but also, two, what are your thoughts when it comes to the minimum wage?  You know, someone that's lived in California for a while, I'm more familiar with the costs here, so that's gonna affect my thoughts on what the minimum wage should be, and so if you're in another state where the cost of living is lower, you might have a different take, but also, if I can add one thing, and it is something that I have a gripe with. The argument, and this is kind of very more focused on like the food services industry or coffee shops, or just things that aren't traditional restaurants.  I think a lot of employers have the knowledge that they are not paying their employees enough, and I think part of that is showcased with the fact that how has everything in the last five years become a tippable transaction? And I say this as someone that tips every time, but for things as small as like I'm buying a coffee at a coffee shop, there's a turn of the screen at that transaction now, either reading 15, 20, 25%, or some places, 20, 25, 30%, and understand, that's been embraced because employers do not wanna raise the price  of their products, and they don't wanna pay their people better, but they're still passing off an extra cost to the consumer, it's just that they're doing it in a way that's not technically that, and it's an awkward interaction for a lot of people. It just becomes about optics. They don't want you to see prices that raised 15%, so they can, you know, actually pay their employees a more livable wage, but you're still paying it. And then, this is one of the wildest bits of news that you've probably never heard about.  In Vietnam, a billionaire real estate tycoon just got sentenced to death for her role in the country's biggest ever fraud case, with the BBC describing this whole thing as the most spectacular trial ever held in Vietnam for one of the greatest bank frauds the world has ever seen. Right, and at the center of this, you have a woman by the name of Truong My Lan. She's 67 years old, and she was found guilty of embezzlement, bribery, and violations of banking rules, with prosecutors saying that the total damages amounted  to $27 billion. Right, so basically, what happened is that Lan managed to accumulate over 90% of the shares of Saigon Commercial Bank, and that, even though Vietnamese law prohibits anyone from holding more than 5% of the shares in any bank, with prosecutors saying that she circumvented the law through hundreds of shell companies and people acting as her proxies. And then with that power, she appointed her own people to senior positions, who she then ordered to approve hundreds of loans to the network  of shell companies that she controlled. And over a period of 11 years, from 2012 to 2022, those fake loans reportedly accounted for 93% of the total credit the bank had issued, with Lan herself actually keeping $4 billion of cash in her basement, which, just as a fun fact, a way to contextualize this, even if all of that was in Vietnam's largest denomination bank notes, that would've weighed two tons, and then on top of that, she allegedly sent a $5 million bribe to a former chief inspector at the central bank,  which also notably, that inspector has been sentenced to life in prison, and also, it's important to note it's just not those two. Lan was actually tried alongside 85 others in this case, with nearly 2,700 individuals, including 200 lawyers being summoned for this five-week trial, and all the documents related to the trial kept in 105 boxes apparently weighing over six tons, which also brings us to the broader context of this trial, which is that it is part of a massive push to crack down on corruption in the country.  In fact, it's a campaign known as Blazing Furnace, and it's led to the indictment of thousands of people and the resignation of two presidents, with experts saying this is the most wide-reaching anti-corruption campaign in the history of the Communist Party of Vietnam, which is also why this trial has been so widely publicized. They want to put on a show, they want to make a statement. In fact, David Brown, a retired US State Department official with long experience in Vietnam, telling the BBC,  "There has never been a show trial like this in the communist era. There has certainly been nothing on this scale." So with that, I think, yeah, you know, with so much information coming from the state and state media, it is good to take all this in with a healthy degree of skepticism, and also, with saying that, there's really nothing to indicate that the charges against Lan are politically motivated, and though she's denied the charges, her defense apparently has been that she joined the banking industry without sufficient experience,  with her blaming a, quote, "lack of understanding of legal matters." Though I will say, it is very hard to imagine someone pulling off a scam like this by accident, though this also as there is a massive debate around the death penalty in this case, but depending on where you go online, people very split on this, where some saying the death penalty for crimes involving money, that's absolutely crazy, but then you go somewhere else, and others very supportive of it, arguing that statements like this have to be made  in a world where large companies and top executives usually just have to pay fines, but with all that said, I gotta pass the question off to you here. Where do you land on this? And then, you know, most people have experienced the same stressful feeling of being in the bottom of a mountain of debt, to the point where you can't even see a way out, and if you're feeling the stress of mounting debt, or you're feeling like your actions at reducing your debt are just not working, today's sponsor, PDS Debt,  has a program that rolls all of your payments into one low monthly payment, more importantly, one low monthly payment based on what you can afford, right?

Most people assume that science and spirituality don't play well together, but it's not true.  Today I wanna tell you about research with the classic psychedelic, psilocybin, that's showing that under supported conditions, psilocybin can occasion mystical-type experiences associated with enduring positive changes in attitudes, mood, and behavior. - Right, so that is Roland Griffiths. He just passed away last fall, and he was probably the world's most famous researcher on psychedelic therapy, with his 2006 paper finding that psilocybin, the active ingredient in magic mushrooms, can, quote, "induce mystical/spiritual experiences  that prompt positive changes in behavior and attitudes that last several months." And it's arguably the reason psychedelic therapy is something we even talk about today, with places like The New York Times even noting in Griffiths' obituary that the paper wasn't just groundbreaking, it was mind-blowing, ushering in what many called a renaissance in psychedelic research, but now more recent reporting from The Times has given us reason to look at Griffiths' research, and really, the whole psychedelic renaissance that it spawned  with a more critical eye, 'cause basically, The Times got their hands on the ethics complaint that was filed against Griffith before he passed away, and that, coming from Matthew Johnson, who's another big name in psychedelic research, who we've actually had on the show before, and who has also been a longtime colleague of Griffiths' at John Hopkins University, with it alleging that Dr. Griffiths ran his psychedelic studies more like a new-age retreat center than a clinical research laboratory,  acting like a spiritual leader and infusing the research with religious symbolism in order to steer volunteers towards the outcome that he wanted. And with all this, Joanna Kempner, a medical sociologist who reviewed the complaint for The Times, saying, "These are serious allegations that need to be investigated." Now with this, to be clear, this is not about maligning Griffiths' memory or his work. In fact, some of the issues that we're gonna touch on today were acknowledged by Griffiths himself.  And it's also not to dispute a huge body of research showing that psychedelics have real potential for treating psychiatric disorders like anxiety, depression, PTSD, and addiction. In fact, as I've made clear on the show, I am an advocate of its medical use, but it is more to highlight that there are smart and qualified people who say that the hype surrounding psychedelics has moved faster than the science. For example, even as the use of psychedelics has skyrocketed in both young and middle-aged adults in the US,  with research even showing that psilocybin's like the most popular one, we actually only have one head-to-head study comparing psilocybin with a traditional antidepressant, with neither one really coming out on top. And with the authors of that study noting that more research is needed. And Eiko Fried, a psychologist at Leiden University in the Netherlands, published a paper saying that psychedelic science is facing serious challenges that threaten the validity of core findings and raise doubt regarding clinical efficacy and safety.  And with that, telling The Times the inferences drawn in the literature at large certainly don't follow from the evidence, and similarly, Nora Volkow, the director of the National Institute of Drug Abuse, saying, "Psychedelic drugs have been promoted as a potential cure for many health conditions without adequate research to support these claims," as well as noting that there are businesses that are very eager to make money by marketing substances as treatments or cures. And so with all of that, these new allegations  against the person who sort of started this are definitely worth talking about, but also, before we get into that, I wanna make one important disclaimer, which is Johnson and Griffiths didn't really get along, at least toward the end of their time working together, the pair reportedly arguing frequently over how to talk to volunteers and the public, and colleagues at Johns Hopkins reportedly weren't a big fan of Johnson either, with allegations that he acted unprofessionally, leading to his removal from a leadership position,  with everything eventually leading to his resignation. So, of course, with that, some might think that Johnson was just acting out of spite. You know, maybe that is true, but as I mentioned, while Johnson's complaint is sort of the starting point for this discussion, he's in fact only one of many to raise these sort of issues, right? So with that said, let's dig into it deep. You know, Griffiths, before studying shrooms, spent several decades publishing research on other mood-altering drugs, his most well-known contribution being the discovery  that caffeine is, in fact, addictive, but in the 1990s, Griffiths had an experience that changed him. - I took up a meditation practice that really altered a core sense of self for me, and it got me asking questions about the nature of spirituality and mystical experience and how some of these kinds of sudden insights and mystical experiences can dramatically change people. - And as Roland goes on to explain, he began thinking about how this newfound interest in the mystical could fit into his existing research.  And he also met a guy by the name of Bob Jesse around this time, a former tech exec who ran the Council on Spiritual Practices, which is a nonprofit that says it's dedicated to making direct experience of the sacred more available to more people. So with funding from Jesse's organization, Griffiths began recruiting volunteers for his first study on psilocybin, with his team reportedly passing out fliers that said, "Seeking persons committed to spiritual development for a study of states of consciousness," which brings us  to Johnson's main criticism against Griffiths' research, you know, about steering results in the direction he wanted, with Michael Pollan, who co-founded the UC Berkeley Center for the Science of Psychedelics, noting that there were no stone-cold atheists among the participants. Instead, participants included an energy healer, a former Franciscan friar, and an herbalist, with the volunteers being given the pill, either actual psilocybin or the placebo, in a chalice-shaped incense burner from Mexico.  And in the room where they did it, there was a selection of spiritual books and a Buddhist statue. And so when you take in all that information, the results might seem a lot less surprising. Now with this, I should note that when this study was published in 2006, many other researchers praised Griffiths' work for its rigor, but at the same time, Griffiths' paper didn't mention the Buddha or the chalice or the fliers. It just said that the participants were adults reporting regular participation  in religious or spiritual activities. And other researchers, like Natasha Mason, a psychopharmacologist at Maastricht University in the Netherlands, noting, "Griffiths' mystical experiences results were very high compared to other groups." For example, Rick Strassman, a psychiatrist at the University of New Mexico, had performed a study on psilocybin before Griffiths, and notably, only one individual in that study, a religious studies major, had a mystical experience. So someone else in that group thought  that they had been abducted by aliens. And again, with this, I wanna be very clear, this is not about criticizing Griffiths. You know, he was actually somewhat open about these shortcomings, reportedly even telling Pollan that his team was interested in a spiritual effect and was biasing the condition initially, with him also acknowledging in a press release at the time that the research tread a fine line between neuroscience and areas most would consider outside science's realm, but importantly, all these issues  weren't just about his 2006 study. They were also about Griffiths' overall style of research. So for example, we have someone by the name of Manoj Doss. They worked with Griffiths on some of his later studies, and they told The Times that he was also taken aback by the forced mystical atmosphere of the studies. And notably with this, Doss also wrote a blog post saying that he is increasingly frustrated by the tendency of the field to make lofty claims about the drugs that stray from the realities and limitations of the data.  And going back to Johnson's complaint, he also recounted an instance where Griffiths actually asked at least one volunteer to reconsider her written rating of the spiritual significance of a session, which apparently specifically happened as part of the study that eventually became the most cited paper in the field, a study investigating whether psilocybin could help people cope with cancer. And actually, with that, one participant in the study committed suicide a week after storming out of his first session, with reports saying  that he was frustrated that he didn't feel the effects of the drug, and though Roland reported the incident to regulators, he allegedly urged his team to keep a lid on. And with that, you have a former mentee of Dr. Griffiths, Natalie Gukasyan, actually talking about this in a paper about the risk of psilocybin-assisted therapy, writing, "With recent media portrayals of psychedelics as cure-all drugs, patients who have failed to find relief from other treatments may come to see psychedelics as a last resort.  If a study participant believes they received a much-hyped treatment and still fails to see improvement, demoralization and hopelessness may ensue." And again, I gotta stress this in a world of out-of-context clips and one-minute attention spans, this is not about pinning everything on Griffiths. As Gukasyan says, the media has played a major part in creating this hype, and actually, Griffiths wrote a paper in 2022 warning about a psychedelic hype bubble driven largely by media and industry interests,  but this also as he was one of the most public and vocal advocates for their use, often appearing on big talk shows and podcasts, with him saying things on those like... - Excitingly, exploration of the psilocybin-occasioned, mystical experience will surely reveal underlying biological mechanisms of action will likely result in an array of therapeutic applications, and more importantly, because such experiences are foundationally related to our moral and our ethical understandings, further research may ultimately prove to be crucial  to the very survival of our species. - And so with all that, the way that I wanna close this segment out because you've been so kind to listen to myself and these clips just yapping, is that even when you are excited about something, you might even be an advocate for something, you should take time to consider and look at things that potentially detract from that because, you know, I can share the story of when I took mushrooms, it was honestly so much better than any antidepressant I've ever taken in my life, but that story is personal  to me, it's anecdotal, and the point of having more research, and why we should all call for more research of things that we're against and for, is the pursuit of truth, even though sometimes the truth can be complicated or nuanced, like with this, maybe certain aspects have been overstated on certain parts. And if you're right, the research just makes your footing even more solid. With all that, I gotta pass the question off to you. What are your thoughts here? And then, did you know that nearly 75%  of people have subscriptions that they've just forgotten about, which I will say, before I started using Rocket Money, I thought I had maybe seven subscriptions. You know, I guess just from like making companies, and like, I had four Netflix accounts. I was so angry, and it was the worst angry 'cause I was angry at myself. That's a no-win angry, and in general, I couldn't believe how many subscriptions I had each month, like things that I'd used for a certain period of time and then just forgot about.  I mean between streaming services, delivery services, everything fucking services, it's never-ending, but thanks to the sponsor of today's show, Rocket Money, I'm no longer wasting money on the ones I forgot about because with Rocket Money, you can see all your subscriptions in one place, and then you see something you don't want, Rocket Money helps you cancel with a few taps. And I like how their dashboard shows me this month's spending compared to last month's, so I can clearly see my spending habits,  plus they offer to help you create a custom budget and keep your spending on track, and get this, they'll even try to negotiate to lower your bills by up to 20%. All you gotta do is submit a picture of your bill, and Rocket Money takes care of the rest. They'll deal with customer service for you, which is why it's not surprising that Rocket Money has over five million users. They've saved a total of 500 million in canceled subscriptions, and they save members up to $740 a year when using all of the app's features.  So stop wasting money on things you don't use. Cancel your unwanted subscriptions by going to rocketmoney.com/pds. It's that simple, that's rocketmoney.com/pds, rocket money.com/pds. And then, I'm really interested to know what y'all are gonna think about this, right? 'Cause moms accused of neglecting their children are getting paid $500 a month, right? And that, because this is actually part of a program that'll study whether extra income can improve the lives of families enough to prevent the need for the government  to take away children and separate families. It's being run by the anti-poverty organization, Mother's Outreach Network, in conjunction with the Harvard Law School's Access to Justice Lab. And the idea is to see if you give low-income families more money, does it help mitigate the problems that contributed to the neglect in the first place, with the program specifically distributing funds to 12 low-income Black mothers in Washington, DC who were investigated for child neglect by the district's Child and Family Services Agency.  And so from now until October, those 12 randomly enrolled mothers will receive $500 a month and then get a lump sum of around $3,000. Right, and more specifically, this study focuses on people who have had claims of child neglect investigated and substantiated by the CFSA, but who are also still allowed to keep their children at home, and as it turns out, that's not necessarily uncommon. Right, as neglect can be defined as a range of things like a child lacking food, shelter, supervision, or education, and so as a result, officials can take a range  of actions depending on the severity of the neglect, like offering childcare resources for less serious cases or removing children from homes for more serious ones. And Jim Greiner, the faculty director at the Access to Justice Lab, he made clear that mothers won't be eligible for the program if the neglect allegations against them were severe enough to have their child removed from their home, but also with this, you know, you have some people saying, "Hey, neglect is neglect. Why are we paying people who neglect their children?"  You know, that's something that Greiner's even acknowledged, conceding that some people might think it's a terrible idea because it's gonna provide a monetary incentive to neglect children, with that, adding that others think that the underlying problem is poverty, in which case, providing money is a fantastic idea because it'll directly alleviate the problem. You know, that was also echoed by Clare Anderson, a senior policy fellow at the University of Chicago's Chapin Hall, who told The Post, "There's a societal narrative  that child abuse and neglect is an individual action by an individual person doing harm to a child," but saying with that, "the evidence shows us that policy choices are contributing significantly to the activation and deployment of Child Protective Services in the lives of families." And Anderson, pointing to the fact that decades of research have repeatedly shown that families who have less access to money, housing, food, legal support, and other services are more likely to be investigated for child neglect.  In fact, studies have found that an overwhelming 85% of families investigated by Child Protective Services nationally, they had incomes that were below 200% of the federal poverty line. Right, so $49,720 for a family of three. You even had the director of the CFSA emphasizing the huge role that poverty plays in the system, saying, "I have no doubt that poverty plays a huge role in how most of the families come to CFSA's attention." You know, like with all things concerning poverty in the US, there are major racial disparities.  For example, Black children and families making up an outsized portion of people involved in the child welfare system. In fact, half of all Black children experience a Child Protective Services investigation by the time they're 18. And in DC, specifically, CFSA data shows that a majority of the children served in their homes or in foster care during the first quarter of this year were Black, which is why this program is specifically being applied to Black mothers exclusively right now. Melody Webb, the executive director  of Mother's Outreach Network, explaining, "The system is penalizing families and taking children away from their homes for being poor. We also wanna combat negative narratives about Black women, Black mothers in particular, whose children are involved in the system." And so with this, you know, I think whatever results we see from this, it's gonna be very interesting 'cause as I often say, whoever first said, "Mo Money Mo Problems," is wrong. It's definitely more money, different problems, 'cause while anecdotal, I will say the times in my life  where we had no money, right, I'm a trailer park kid, those were the hardest of times. With that said, I gotta ask, what are your thoughts on this study? And then, in huge international news, you know, as Russia continues its war against Ukraine, this much smaller country is finding itself in desperate need of troops. In fact, so much so that Ukraine's parliament just passed a new law amending how the draft works, who's eligible, and the penalties for draft dodgers, with lawmakers having discussed this law for months,  also dragging their feet on this issue, and that's likely because they knew that it would be extremely unpopular, but seemingly, they've been spurred into action after military commanders came to speak to them this week. Right, and during those speeches, lawmakers learned just how bad the situation in Ukraine's east really is, 'cause over there, Russian troops outnumber Ukrainian ones 10 to 1, and in some of the lucky parts, it's just seven to one, which is just too major of a difference, and it makes anything more than just desperately holding  onto territory impossible. And the military pretty much said all of that bluntly. With this, President Zelenskyy still has to sign the law, which he is expected to do, although he was probably hoping that other measures would've been enough. Right, 'cause the law had already been changed once to lower the draft age to 27, and then Zelensky used other emergency measures to drop it again to 25 temporarily. Now this new law making that a permanent fixture and giving other mechanisms to lower the age again  if needed, which most military commanders want, but also with this, you know, that is ineffective without up-to-date information about would-be draftees. So the law now gives Ukrainian men 60 days to update their draft information or they face penalties, although notably, those penalties aren't nearly as bad as the early versions of the bill wanted, with this version instead being just large fines and really kind of a slap on the wrist in the grand scheme of things, but just updating that information alone  is expected to help a ton. Right, like imagine if the US implemented a draft again, and they relied on the Selective Service card that men filled out when they were 18. You know, most of us don't live in that same spot anymore, and we aren't required to update it. So that information would be so out of date that it's borderline useless, which is exactly what Ukraine's struggling with. Also, since I think it's understood that getting drafted into the military, that just sucks, Ukraine is also trying to offer a carrot, right?  Try to make things a little better for those who decide to volunteer instead by, one, raising their pay, and two, also making this an option for some convicts, although notably, that is not expected to move a massive number of people. Also something that the law fails to do, which will likely fuel its unpopularity, is limit how long someone can serve. Currently, it is open-ended service, and there have been Ukrainians fighting on the front lines for two years. And because there is an increasing shortage of manpower,  many haven't been rotated out, which is actually a much bigger deal than you may realize. And like we learned over a hundred years ago that during World War I, rotating the front lines helps a ton. It keeps soldiers more sane, more effective, and otherwise, they get battle fatigue, but if this draft law actually works as lawmakers hope that it does, then the soldiers might actually get some rest. Although with this, not at least till mid-May after recruits are trained, and even with that, Ukraine's commanders told politicians  to not expect any miracles because despite how much they have fucked up in this war, Russia's military has become increasingly competent and better armed, whereas Ukraine's in this situation where they just really need weapons, which is another reason lawmakers wanted to pass this, with many feeling that it would show international partners that they're serious, they are desperate, which would then hopefully open up the flow of weapons again, and in some instances, that may work, or with the EU Parliament now actually doing the opposite  of Republicans here at home. They are blocking funding for certain functions of the EU unless the delivery of advanced Patriot weapon systems is approved, and this as, of course, Republicans here in the States continue to block real aid to Ukraine because the US has still managed small sales here and there, but the massive aid packages of ammo and guns that Ukraine has begged for continue to be held up. And seemingly, the only way that changes is if the election goes a certain way in November, both at the presidential level and the congressional level.  And either way, from now till then, Russia is just continuing to ramp up its pressure and constant missile strikes against Ukraine. And then, finally, today, we have me just kinda yapping about some stuff I found interesting, and yesterday, today, as far as the yap, I had a number of y'all tweeting at me yesterday, saying I willed something into existence. And that is that after my random rant around "Heroes," it was reported, "Heroes" reboot in the works from series creator Tim Kring called "Heroes: Eclipsed."  which is reportedly set years after the events of the original series, featuring familiar villains and new enemies. Though I will say I am skeptical if it is gonna be good. I will have hope, but there's just something about that first season that was like, there was lightning in a bottle. Also, regarding entertainment, I got two more things to say. One, I was happy to learn in the last 24 hours that "Project Hail Mary," the movie, one, not only has Gosling in it, but two, will be coming out in 2026.  I know I've said it now multiple times in the past, if you have not listened to or read "Project Hail Mary," it's great sci-fi, mainstream, consumable sci-fi that's still like perfectly nerdy enough. And the final entertainment thing I'll say is it feels like there's just a lot of good stuff happening right now. It felt like there was this at least two-month drought for a while, but there's so much good stuff. I did a double feature last weekend of "Monkey Man" and "Late Night with the Devil." Both phenomenal, I also gotta say Dev Patel  is just a-fucking-mazing. I'm gonna try to sneak away to see "Arcadian" and "Civil War." Also, the new "Fallout" series just came out, and I'm only one episode in but fucking fantastic so far. But anyway, I'm done gushing about that. Let's talk about those comments yesterday, starting with a lot of people saying they feel bad about giving their parents so much shit when they were a kid for not giving them Lunchables. Right, Catherine saying, "I used to be so jealous of the kids who got Lunchables.  Now I'm gonna call my mom and apologize." And HyperWolf saying, "Thanks, Mom, for never buying us Lunchables. I used to ask my mom why we weren't allowed them, and she'd just say, 'I love you too much to feed you garbage.'" Even saying, "I got bullied for not having Lunchables as a kid a few times until I told the other kids their parents didn't love them if they bought them that garbage. Never got picked on again," though notably, you had folks like Gnome saying, "Anthony Bourdain said it best,  'Everybody should eat healthy, everybody should eat organic. But, when it to feeding your kids on a budget, Mom is gonna pick 99 cent cheeseburgers over $5 salads.' Until we start making it affordable to eat healthy, we can't complain that our food is unhealthy. We wanna say we care about children and their nutrition, but we also make it so that the average child's family can't afford proper nutrition." And then a lot of people were arguing in the replies on that about what food costs next to them.  And Haiku also chiming in, saying, "It's pretty funny that Kraft is like, 'You should not focus on one single ingredient,' but they fail to mention that the ingredient in question is literally lead. They're essentially saying, 'Yeah, there is poison but only one poison, and we added a bunch of other stuff too.'" Then, finally, there was a lot of conversation, understandably, about Elisa Jordana, with Kilometers saying, "As a Floridian, we do not claim Elisa Jordana. She's a snowbird who was born in Jersey.  She could have broken up with her boyfriend the normal way instead of doing all these theatrics that absolutely put lives at risk, especially streaming while driving. South Florida roads are some of the craziest roads in the state next to I-4, and she's just gonna livestream it while talking on the phone and looking at texts? Her license needs to be revoked. With what her boyfriend did, it was scummy, and honestly, fuck that guy, but did she really have to have this mental breakdown on social media to the point  where the fight in that car happened? Anything is content, anything for a view." Others adding that she needs to have her account banned for doxxing Sarah and also for abusing her boyfriend live on camera and driving recklessly, endangering other innocent drivers on the road. And Hunter saying, "The way that he flinched when she approached him, the way he doesn't fight back, the ease at which she attacks him while driving. I highly doubt this is the first time she's been physically abusive towards him."  But that my friends is where today's show is gonna end.

offers finished oh goodness I'm closer than I thought I just need to complete one deal oh here we go now this is really where the scam starts to take place because what you need to do is you need to complete five total deals and I need to complete one deal on this level to continue and this is a level one deal and as I keep continuing through this scam it's gonna get progressively worse so I can pick  any one of these offers and some of these are quite transparent like I need to deposit five dollars into an investment account then I'll get five dollars and chances are they'll probably have like a hundred dollar membership fees so you at the end of the day are paying money to this platform to get your free Robux gift card this one here is I can get a whole bunch of free drinks I just

personally I have been an idiot that did fall for one of these before and I got  yelled at by my parents that is why I'm also sad that kids do fall for this because they'll have to go through the same crap I did it's not fun now I spent a whole bunch of time trying to go through each one of these offer first to get a level one deal without paying any money because I didn't want to give any of these companies my credit card because I would probably be screwed and I couldn't do any of them because what would happen is I would sign up for one of these Services I'd click Start deal  and I'd have to go through their process and to finalize their whole entire process which Guardia once again telling me this is a redirect scam going to a scam website but if I tried filling out each one of these surveys eventually all of them would ask for a PayPal account or a credit card and when I click verify my PayPal account let's see it is my PayPal account but it says pay with debit or credit card it is going to try to charge my PayPal and take money from me of course this is not free Robux this  is get scammed by a whole bunch of companies get frustrated and get zero Robux and the best part about it all is that if you are a kid using your personal information well first off you're gonna have your email be absolutely bombarded I cannot wait two days for my email to absolutely be be unusable but if you did put in your actual phone number you're going to be called a whole bunch with a whole bunch of scams and you're kind of screwed to be completely honest now I was confused honestly I was promised freed Robux and  I didn't get it so going back to my DM interaction with protesty protesty said that I only based my research off of statistical charts instead of people's emotions he's right I never thought about people's emotions with Robux instead of having to you know finish the survey by using my credit card maybe I could write them a poem just kidding but instead what I did is I decided to really just look at the comments of these videos this person here said it really works touching but what about the people like myself that are frustrated  that they couldn't get their free Robux well what I did is I went to a different protesty video and they also had a survey at the very bottom and I said I didn't get any Robux this is fake this is on my uh give bowbox account which I made for some reason I don't know why but I said it was fake because I didn't get any Robux my emotions were negative but looking at the same video on an incognito tab because this is very important you can see my comments here I'm upset but in an incognito tab if I  sort these comments by newest first and I look for my comments which will take a very long time because of course if I scroll up it's barely working so I made it I scrolled down long enough and my my Chrome was lagging at this point but as you can tell my give Roblox comment saying that this is fake was eight days ago and I'm on the video and I'm scrolling through the comments and uh guess what comment I don't see my comment was nowhere in there now I can explain what's going on here in fact protesty set up a filter in their  YouTube Studio but if you send a comment that has a filtered word YouTube will still show you that you sent your comment just to make sure that you don't try to bypass the filter or get upset and angry but when I went to an incognito tab to look for my comments it was removed and that's because the filter removed it so I guess now it's impossible to gauge people's emotions protesty I can't do it on on your channel anymore but this made me realize maybe I was researching the wrong people I shouldn't be researching the emotions  of the kids that are getting scammed and have no idea maybe I should research the emotions of protesty and protesty's emotional response just all caps they're very upset they work on videos eight hours a day God what a pathetic miserable existence but they are very angry now I truly need your help in analyzing this message from protesty go f yourself you egotistical sadistic prideful arrogant okay hold on Boss put down the thesaurus for a second slanderous blaspheming heretic he also spelled blaspheming and heretic wrong so  let's do an analysis do you think protesty is upset well I said once again emotional response and they blocked me so rewinding a little bit protesty told me one very valuable piece of information I was talking about how these were scams but protesty is talking about the big YouTubers who do real Robux giveaways such as is land or boy mert with the messed up posture clown show the Clown that started this all and finally Carter escapule which I'm not even gonna get into because first off apparently they have a gold play button  their Channel's not even that big their whole thing is financed and their Channel's dead this is this is one of those rabbit holes within a rabbit hole this is too deep for me to go for today but let's try out clown shows surveys so I'm gonna click on one of their YouTube shorts pause it instantly so I don't lose IQ go to their comments and as we can see there is a pinned message here's how to get the Robux visit this YouTube post complete everything it asks for and enjoy my books so I click on this post  and I go to my boy is land yes our boy mer clown show in his land together forever and mert tells me to visit this YouTube post and this goes to is and what does this is channel say well I need to go to smart link here do everything it asks for and enjoy my Bo bucks and I must like this post you don't have to like someone's post and then also some legal stuff that really won't help you at all anyways clicking on the smart link here well Guardia one once again telling me that this is a malicious website 100 Roblox game gift  card oh my God I gotta enter my my fake first name again Andrew Alex on Minecraft continue anyways 100 Roblox game card I'm in America I changed my VPN to Washington oh and we go back to level up rewards it's the same website again yeah oh my gosh it's the same survey crap that led nowhere because it was always gonna try and charge my credit card or PayPal account oh this one's a hundred and twenty five dollars I'm so lucky but one thing I do want to point out is that this Merc guy isn't the best  person in the world in fact they started off with scams of course with iPhone giveaways and it's almost incoherence when you watch this video I'm gonna tell you guys how like um if you guys want or not on in the announcing winners when I started YouTube that's exactly how I started my videos but as their career progressed they got into uh rap music turn off the beat a little bit turn it up turn it up these guys his guys you know if I did emotional research here I'm touched my heart it is truly I  don't know what miracle happened in my life but I eventually made it to watch this video so I'm glad I can share it with everyone I think the best part about this all is when mert failed in both his rap career and his iPhone giveaway career he tried making an automation Channel where basically they'll make you a YouTube channel where it automatically runs and you just make money and print it for free that's not how life works but my favorite part is watching some of these videos you can tell that mert is absolutely living his  best life depressed but it doesn't stop there because even his friends bully him in the comments bro quit school to play Roblox it doesn't stop there because talking about mert is truly and honestly my passion on YouTube and when I go to Mert's Channel their description this channel is not owned by Islam it is owned by his dad his land did not create this Channel and doesn't have access he's just a paid actor he's putting this because his YouTube channel did get suspended for a brief period and  somehow YouTube lit this back up I don't know what's going on here this will definitely work and I think the saddest part is that mert will get 1 million subscribers before me so unless you don't smash the ever living crap out of the Subscribe button we're gonna be losing to this idiot now in terms of Mert's contents it's truly probably one of the most beautiful things on the planet we have how to become Sonic in Brookhaven we have expectation and we have reality oh thank goodness he didn't remove my comment now at this point I  think I'm basically cyber bullying someone so I might lay off a little bit but I do want to point out that they also have how to turn zero Robux into Infinite Robux and maybe mert has some sort of system that that isn't a scam because like protesty said this isn't a scam Islam is legit do you think this video is going to start off with screaming you you yes so I already did the sin of watching this whole video so mert probably got like a cent worth of AD Revenue which really tears my heart apart let's see how we get infinite  Robux you know what I'm saying so first click on the Roblox tab right over here this is Step number one step two You're Gonna Wanna click on the Roblox amount that you want okay now it could be any of these okay well I'm gonna click is the 10 000 Robux not the 22 22 000 oh I can okay but just click on one of the amounts all right skipping more of Mer okay honestly murt has a a gift their greatest gift is not only being the dumbest 18 year old on the planet that did drop out of school but their gift is  really being able to ramble absolute incoherent nonsense for eight minutes without losing their dignity that they're trying to scam kids on Roblox for like less than a thousand dollars a month wow I really went off there but step two is Click redeem Roblox Card okay we're we're enough with your Chit Chat I'm losing my brain cells at this point but you're supposed to redeem a Roblox gift card then you enter in a pin which doesn't exist then it will give you an error oh we zoomed in Fancy video editing skills maybe he has some  potential and then mert tells you to delete a couple of letters just remove the one and you press redeem again and while you're redeeming you go to your home page if you can't tell already this is an absolute waste of time then go on your browser and go to the pin comment thank you mert I had no idea what I was supposed to do I thought I was supposed to watch your video and get free Robux no I gotta go to the scam survey website for the third time in this video God it's the same post smart link here I'm  losing my mind oh it's a little bit different this time that's cool maybe we might have something here maybe mert is Spitting Fire maybe murd is someone who's misunderstood maybe they're giving me actual proper free Robux okay download and run Opera GX block the site because it's malicious thank you guardio I knew it was malicious already alright so I go through 30 000 different redirects and I should be able to download Opera GX anyways while that's processing and doing all that crazy bogus stuff I gotta pick another survey  hmm I'm gonna do the a hundred dollar Walmart gift card just in case I don't want to go too big because they might ask for my credit card again so 100 Walmart gift card oh no not again okay not a hundred dollar gift card I don't want to be on that level up rewards website oh Opera GX opened up 750 to my cash account click on it again Level Up Rewards oh no my Chase account click on it please don't be level up Rewards please don't please be a different survey website it didn't even work so I'm stuck on using offers from Level Up  Rewards so it's the same thing at the end of the day it's the same scam but as the wise researcher protesty said I have to look at both facts and emotions so it's emotional research time and what I did is I added Mert's Discord account to piss them off I mean to do emotional research of course and I got nothing is that the end of my emotional research no because I haven't Ace up my sleeve and this is probably the best part of the video this is what I've been dying to tell everyone murt try to take down my  video for copyright infringement now I've made it very clear that mert is not the sharpest tool in the shed they are an absolute idiot but this surpasses how dumb they are because this is a legal document and when you sign that document with a legal name it needs to be a real name and mert signed it with mert James and that's not Mert's real legal name now instead of me getting my lawyers out uh YouTube actually just said this is a completely crap notice and we're not removing it so my emotional research has  made me conclude that mer is very angry they try to take down a video and it flopped now why would mert go to the extent of trying to take down my video well these people hosting these live streams get paid to promote this survey in fact here is a screenshot from a forum and this is on a website where people basically try to make a whole bunch of money with zero effort but look at this post here we have a rewards thing a giveaway and you can get a temu 500 gift card and what website is this oh my gosh it's up level rewards the  same one I've been struggling with for the past however many minutes this video has been and when someone completes that survey and goes through with it these guys get four dollars yes mert went through all of this work to set up these bogus live streams to scam kids and also to send in a bogus legal notice that put them at massive legal risk all so they can make four dollars every time they scam a kid by promising them free Robux by making them fill out surveys and the worst part is that YouTube kind of lets  it happen there are a ton of these channels like I'm literally going through a lot of them and some of them do weird quirky things like animojis this person coming up next they uh did a vtuber thing just to hide their face come on guys if you're really gonna scam you need to go the mert method and show your face so that anyone that knows you in real life can bully you for being a worthless piece of garbage that scams kids for once again four dollars if you see one of these live streams floating  around just click on the three dots and click on report and it's spam or misleading I know we gotta choose one which one are we gonna choose it's scams or fraud and this applies to Links within the description we just need to provide some certain details the pinned comment in the live stream redirects to a Robux scam survey website and we click on report and hopefully the robots at YouTube because a human's definitely not looking at this will understand that and take down this live stream and eventually take down this channel  anyways that is all I got I don't know how long this video is gonna be I went through a whole bunch of stuff if you enjoyed it I'm gonna ask this time please do like and subscribe because this was a lot of work anyways bye bye sweetheart I love you 	Liberal			Leaning Liberal	192
P68	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV4wY2rjAWY&ab_channel=MichaelSaba	[Music] of all the books that have ever laid claim to the title of the great american novel one tome towers above the rest hermann melville's 1851 whaling epic moby dick is perhaps the essential treatise on the story of america melville was america's own shakespeare or dostoyevsky a prophet who exposes their native country's pride violence and immorality you probably already know the story even if you've never cracked its pages a doomed whaling ship piloted by the mad captain ahab pursues a bloody quest for  revenge against the eponymous white whale moby dick bit off ahab's leg maiming him and instilling in him a burning thirst for vengeance in pursuit of this revenge ahab sacrifices his crew his ship and finally his own life none survive the cursed journey but saying that moby dick is a book about how revenge is bad would be like saying dr strangelove is a movie about how nuclear weapons are bad sure it's technically a true statement but it also totally misses the bigger picture and the themes these works are  expressing urge mr president we must not allow a mind shout gap sir i have a plan because moby dick is more than just a novel it is the ultimate cipher and skeleton key to understanding the history of the united states and the past three centuries of western industrial capitalist society consider the subject matter whaling when moby dick was published the most widely used hydrocarbon in the world wasn't gasoline it was whale oil all around the world whales were hunted and killed for their blubber their meat  their bones and their skins but most of all for their oil just as coal and crude oil were the fuels that powered the industrial expansion of the 20th century whale oil was the fuel that powered the 17 and 1800s in moby dick america is brought to life in the form of ahab's ship the peakwood so named for the pequot tribe of indigenous americans this tribe was slaughtered by puritan settlers in the early 1600s giving rise to what is now the state of connecticut in the novel the 30-man crew of the peakwood are a jumble of races  ethnicities religions and political beliefs that number 30 is especially significant there were only 30 united states when moby dick was published and slavery was still legal in 15 of them despite frequent clashes around identity and social status this multicultural and diverse crew somehow manages to co-exist and function but like america itself the dark side is never far removed in hunting moby dick ahab consecrates a black mass spurring his crew into an unholy frenzy against the spirit of nature itself  now drinking mates happiness ye that stand the bow of the whaleboat drink and swear death is to moby dick drink and swear may god hunt us all if we do not hunt moby dick do his death like their captain every member of the piquit becomes infected and disfigured by this lust for revenge those who could object or who might have the power to stop this madness say nothing and are silent everyone dies and moby dick sinks the peakwood beneath the waves and in the closing words of the book the great shroud of the sea rolled on as it  rolled five thousand years ago moby dick is considered a masterpiece today but it took a few decades for the world to come around initial reviews of the novel were very mixed and melville was frequently criticized for his meandering and heavy-handed prose only about 3 000 copies were sold while melville was still alive the first print run of moby dick was also incomplete and did not contain the epilogue chapter revealing that the narrator ishmael had survived the sinking of the pequod the british publisher also censored  certain passages of the book which forced melville to make some last minute rewrites to get it printed moby dick stands as a testament to how the true meaning of the greatest works of fiction are not found in a rote recitation of their stories their power lies beyond words expressing something universal that is deeply felt by all human beings true art transforms us giving voice to the meaning behind the words this is a story about america about war and bloody violence this is a story about how the forces we  seek to conquer and control are the very things that will be our undoing and most of all this is a story about how a misunderstood gaming masterpiece ended up being even more prescient and powerful than we could have ever realized [Music] [Music] what's that kill [Music] [Applause] at the time this video is being published it's been nearly five years since the release of metal gear solid v this game was the subject of the very first analysis video i ever did on this channel and hell the metal gear series  is the main reason i started to care about game analysis in the first place five years later mgs v still holds up better than any other game in the series three included from a purely mechanical gameplay perspective this is indeed the ultimate metal gear a stealth action sandbox with near limitless modularity and replayability that's every bit as compelling now as it was when it was first released in 2015. there's also an incredible confidence and deftness to the game's storytelling that woman i know  she knows our location either way one of these days we're gonna have to kill her but now is not the time [Music] when the time comes [Music] i'll pull the trigger [Music] the mandatory codec calls interrupting the action are almost entirely gone with these conversations relegated to optional cassette tapes that can be listened to at any time and while the cutscenes make up less of the overall play time than the previous games in the series the cinematic sequences of mgsv benefit enormously from this quality over quantity approach  these cutscenes are masterful with their use of cinematic language with a visual flair that almost no other game before or since can touch now go let the legend come back to life [Music] but when it comes to the discourse around this game such a lust for revenge what the hell happened to metal gear solid 5. that that army and i just code army the discovery that episode 51 was cut from the game and director hideo kojima's subsequent ouster from konami after the game's release gave rise to a narrative  that money-minded konami had done our beloved co-genius dirty forcing him to compromise his vision and abridge or remove huge chunks of mgsv leaving a woefully incomplete final product and this truth became an unshakable meme wipe this meme from the face of the earth this meme that mgsv is unfinished was very lucrative for some of the people who created it but it was also insincere and hugely insulting to the game's entire creative team series director hideo kojima has said in multiple interviews since  leaving konami's legal grasp that mgsv is a complete and finished product and that he is satisfied with the game he released story included [Music] but this whole episode raised some very interesting questions about the idea of artistic integrity the death of the author and what it means to call a piece of art incomplete because by the same standard that was used to tar and feather mgsv the revered masterpiece metal gear solid 2 is also shamefully incomplete and a permanent blot on the records of everyone involved  multiple bosses and levels couldn't be finished in time and were scrapped from the game the sniper boss oldboy was booted to mgs3 where he became the end the dead cell spiritualist yikes was cut from the game and folded into vamp the whole second half of the game shell 2 was abridged and cut short and perhaps most significantly entire sections of the ending sequence of metal gear solid 2 like scenes showing the statue of liberty being destroyed and manhattan's battery park being crushed underneath arsenal gear were censored  for political considerations since the game came out mere weeks after the events of september 11 2001 at long last it seems that she will go through the immigration process will lady liberty finally get her green card mgs2 is also absolutely incomplete when measured by the metric of what fans expected versus what they got for years and years the game was absolutely torn to shreds for its bait and switch protagonist swap from the gruff stoic and hyper-masculine solid snake to the fae whiny and effeminate  ryden for a long time fans hated mgs2 for making us play as an inferior shadow of the beloved main character it took nearly a decade of deep analysis and reflection for the game to be rightly recognized as an incredibly prescient piece of speculative fiction which predicted so much of the internet-mediated dystopia we're currently living in but in the current digitized world trivial information is accumulating every second preserved in all its triteness never fading always accessible rumors about petty issues misinterpretation  slander all this junk data preserved in an unfiltered state growing at an alarming rate it will only slow down social progress reduce the rate of evolution right you seem to think that our plan is one of censorship are you telling me it's not you're being silly what we propose to do is not to control content but to create context create context and with mgs v it's happening all over again it is happening again i started this video by talking about moby dick not just because of the obvious thematic parallels  after all the game was only too happy to invite these comparisons from the initial e3 hype campaign courtesy of joaquim magrin of moby dick studios through to the numerous in-game call-outs arriving shortly at ld okay have time to go [Music] the similarities between mgsv and moby dick go so much deeper than surface level invocation each is the work of a creator who thinks relentlessly about the way the world functions and the hidden forces that shape our reality and each story reflects its historical  moment in its own way mgs v holds a black mirror up to our own reality as the series has done in every previous installment but even more critically mgsv is a dark inversion of the story and themes of the most controversial game in the series v has come too mgsv is loaded with imagery and dialogue centered around duality and reflections in other words mirrors this duality is even baked into the structure of the game itself with the split between the opening prologue chapter of ground zeroes followed by the  game proper in the phantom pain the tale begins with the legendary super soldier big boss aka naked snake conducting a solo infiltration of the us-run guantanamo prison encampment in cuba betrayed by his country and disaffected by how soldiers are abused and discarded by those they serve snake founded the private military force militar sol frontier an army for hire to anyone who can afford them upon completing his mission in guantanamo and rescuing his comrades the truth is revealed it was all a ruse  designed to lure big boss away from msf's mother base so the illuminati deep state damn the patriots could wipe them out entirely the aftermath of the attack on mother base leaves snake in a coma for nine years severing his left arm and embedding his body with 108 pieces of shrapnel upon examination we discovered 108 foreign bodies embedded within including a gigantic horn-like shard protruding from his forehead let's do a quick numerology interlude because that number 108 is especially significant  many denominations of hinduism buddhism zen and jainism speak of the 108 impurities and imperfections that all humans must struggle through in order to reach enlightenment mental and physical impairment are unavoidable after shaking off his nine year coma and awakening in the year 1984 naked snake embraces his inner demon rubbing our noses in bloody battlefield dirt all for revenge the world calls for wet work and we answer no greater good no just cause god cypher sent us to hell [Music] but we're going even deeper  msf is reborn as diamond dogs and the boss himself as venom snake he then embarks on a quest for revenge that will see him carve a path across soviet-occupied afghanistan and the civil war-racked border region between the central african nations of angola and zaire across the story of both ground zeroes and the phantom pain the player encounters a steady procession of mirror imagery both big and small obvious and not ground zeroes begins with us seeing the game's antagonist reflected in a soldier's helmet and then again in a  jeep's side window the phantom pane opens with a slow camera pan and zoom towards a mirror as the on-screen text welcomes you to just another day in a war without end very often imagery is first revealed to the player not by showing the thing directly but by showing its reflection the cutscene cinematography frequently positions characters as opposites of each other whether to indicate a clash of values a meeting of rivals or a struggle between the angels and demons whispering over your shoulder  the game puts mirrored digits in front of your eyes every single time you begin a mission the game also stresses this theme of duality in its spoken dialogue whether it's relayed through the cinematics or the cassettes characters will frequently say a word or phrase and then quickly follow it up with contrasting language group above nations even the us and i was the parasite below feeding off zero's power just as you live because of me he lives because of you look up please i know it's difficult  but please look down all the good news is here in the land of the living bad news on your feet soldier the whole place is coming down [Music] need a little pick me up okay this war is peace cipher sent us to hell that was not my kind of place anyway i chose the language of gratitude instead and go back to silence [Music] i am quiet i am the absence of words these constant invocations of duality have a subtle suggestive almost hypnotic quality to them the player is being subconsciously primed for what's to come even if you're  not aware of it in your rational brain you may have one notion of reality or one sense of your own identity but then something different something strange is reflected back at you by the black mirror so which version of events can you trust what's real and what's an illusion the game's narrative is further fractured not just by the form but also the format not only is mgsv divided between ground zeroes and the phantom pain but the phantom pain itself is divided between its halves of chapter one revenge and chapter two race  in retrospect it's clear that konami mandated that ground zeroes be released as a standalone game in order to recoup some of the sky-high development costs for this project and i think this is the primary reason why players and critics alike seem to have mostly not noticed how mgsv's story and themes mirror those of metal gear solid 2. this is a ruse we've seen before [Music] metal gear solid 2's divide between the tanker snake and plant ryden chapters served the same purpose as mgs v's split between ground zeroes and the phantom  pain you begin the game with an intro chapter that is pure stealth action pornography starring the glorious badass self-insert wish fulfillment protagonist in full regalia and as you lay down the thunder on hapless guard after hapless guard you think to yourself i am so awesome but this inciting incident then takes a dark turn transitioning the story into a much broader and stranger tale throughout the rest of the game the events of the intro are constantly remixed and re-contextualized and given  new weight and import and as the climax strikes the entire story is revealed to be unreliable narration from an unreliable narrator the player's identity is stripped away until they can no longer trust the reality unfolding in front of them and as you stumble away from the battlefield confused and unsure of anything including your own identity you think to yourself who am i [Music] [Applause] [Music] who you really are is indeed the central theme of mgsv what kind of person is your big boss is he a kind and philanthropic soul who  loves his comrades never takes a life if he can help it and spends his spare time creating a shelter home for endangered animals or is he the bloody demon of legend the nuclear-armed monster who murders friend and foe alike without a moment's hesitation thanks to the sandbox open world format and its tremendous emphasis on player freedom that question is entirely up to you go okay no matter what kind of big boss you think you are your freedom turns out to be a meaningless illusion in its pre-release trailers the game was  hyped to us as the tail that would close the 28-year loop of the metal gear saga we would finally learn how men become demons and how the beloved warrior poet of mgs3 and peace walker became the nightmare that haunts every hero and villain in the series and for the first half of mgsv the revenge chapter it really seems like that's where the story is headed after being betrayed and left for dead the player will rise from the ashes like the phoenix and single-handedly rebuild the legend of big boss  the first half of the phantom pain sees the player recruit and train a new private army construct a new mother base be joined by one badass ally after another and develop equipment and weapons worthy of the greatest super spy the 80s has ever seen [Music] [Music] you uncover a globe-trotting conspiracy about parasites that infect human vocal cords get a ton of weapons and gadgets along the way and enjoy some cool body horror and weird science story beats that help keep things interesting it's exactly the over-the-top and maximalist  approach to storytelling that we love kojima and the metal gear series for just in a different container a different format the narrative culminates with a solo infiltration of the enemy's secret fortress which sees you disabling their nuclear-equipped superweapon and claiming it as your own in that glorious moment metal gear sahalanthropus towers over mother base as the ultimate trophy for a conquering warrior of the nuclear age had the game ended right here with the triumphant climax of missions 30 and 31 there's no  doubt that metal gear solid v would have been far less controversial we hold our rifles in missing hands we stand tall on missing legs we stride forward on the bones of our fallen then and only then are we alive this pain is ours and no one else's the secret weapon we wield out of sight this was the ending and the resolution we've been conditioned to want by decades of hollywood blockbusters and indeed the metal gear games themselves you conquer the enemy base beat the giant robot maybe do a 1v1 with the big  bad and everyone rides off into the sunset while kojima delivers one final monologue via stand-in about how we live in a society again this bears repeating any other game would have ended things here and we would have loved it for it the victorious big boss triumphs over the new world order seizes the ultimate nuclear weapon and is cursed forevermore to play the villain in the eyes of the world but then comes the second half of mgsv snake must return to the battlefield once more soon you'll be replaying new variants of  missions you've completed before committing yourself and your forces to an eternal proxy war without end the crew of mother base is gripped with a totally baseless and evidence-free paranoia that they've been infiltrated by spies and saboteurs watch the man to your left to your right assume nothing report everything it's the only way to protect ourselves one by one all those bad ass allies who joined ranks with you over the course of chapter one leave or are cast out of mother base and just to drive the point  home they take your giant robot trophy with them this all comes to a head with mission 43 shining lights even in death this is both the black mirror that closes the loop of the narrative and the thematic finale of the entire game a new vocal cord parasite outbreak has taken place and no cure is possible you must murder every single soldier scientist and patient in mother base's quarantine platform to prevent the plague from spreading you begin the game in the prologue as a hospital patient escaping from enemy  soldiers as they mow down the facility's patients and staff shining lights ends the game with an attack on a medical ward where you're forced to execute your own soldiers a darkened version of the very same atrocities you witnessed in the game's beginning you start the game by putting on a new face and in shining lights you end the game by smearing the funeral ashes of your dead troops across your visage if chapter one is the player rebuilding the legend of big boss then chapter 2 forces the player to  experience the breakdown and deconstruction of that legend until all that's left is captain ahab and his ship full of fanatics pursuing mindless revenge against an enemy who might not even be real what if she's a spy what if i'm a spy are you go on all day and then comes the final revelation in mission 46 truth the beloved and adored series protagonist who you thought you were playing as this entire game gives way to someone else entirely the player is not big boss the player is you at the end of mgsv the main character is  revealed to be a body double for snake forced to undergo surgery and hypnosis in order to become a literal scapegoat for the commander to whom you've dedicated your life this one he'll take your place from here on he's snake he believes it too my very own phantom huh your skin of your teeth escaped from the hospital and indeed your very identity are a ruse engineered by a different creeping tentacle of the same illuminati deep state that put you in a coma in the first place you've been fighting a phantom enemy  this entire time your true reason for being is to draw attention away from the real big boss and keep the eyes of the world focused on you the real big boss is off on a top secret mission building the glorious future he promised to his soldiers but you your cannon fodder this is the ultimate evil of big boss his heel turn into villainy he became a hypocrite who mouthed flowery words about freedom and independence but in the end he abused and betrayed his subordinates in the exact same way that he was once exploited and cast aside by  the us government and he makes everyone who follows him complicit in his deeds metal gear solid 2 told us that the hero's solid snake was really a hollow facade a chimeric fantasy role that anyone could inhabit with enough motivation and training even a total loser like ryden again the black mirror shines back at us mgsv tells us that anyone can be big boss but this is not the same message of self-liberation espoused by the end of mgs2 this is a prophecy of damnation and the ultimate condemnation of the hollywood  power fantasy that the metal gear games have always aimed to subvert and deconstruct [Music] [Music] [Applause] mgs2 ended with the directive that the player should break free from the self-insert fantasy of trying to emulate a fictional action hero idol because this way of thinking is a prison one that can blind you to the reality in front of you and make you that much easier to manipulate anyone you know no never heard the name before [Music] i'll pick my own name and my own life i'll find something worth passing on  to be free to live a truly heroic life you must find your own meaning outside of received wisdom and official truths but mgs v ends on a diametrically opposing note to the player if you still want to be snake so badly after playing all these games then please enjoy your first class ticket to hell because we are all going down together it all comes full circle with this revelation you the player of 2015's mgs v are the big boss that the player of 1987's metal gear must kill in order to beat the game  the circle is complete and the snake swallows its own tail all that's left to us is an eternally recurring loop of violence and death directed first at an external enemy and finally against ourselves [Music] [Music] for quite a while i had thought that mgsv was one long extended parable about the post-9 11 united states and its global quest for revenge against terrorism and yes that's definitely one interpretation the metal gear games have always been sly and sharp parables on the perils of militarism and foolish imperial power  games four years ago the soviets invaded afghanistan muslims are fighting back with western support [Music] but after this most recent play through i'm more convinced than ever that mgs v is really a game about japan the government of japanese prime minister shinzo abe is currently pursuing an objective that has long been desired by the country's more authoritarian political elements the revocation of article 9 of japan's post-world war ii constitution following japan's defeat and post-war occupation by the u.s the country wrote  article 9 into its new constitution which outlawed war as a means of settling international disputes but that idealism wouldn't last long in 1949 the chinese communist revolution was complete and chairman mao zedong officially declared the foundation of the people's republic of china washington nervously watched as japan was gripped by economic stagnation and hyperinflation which led to the rapid rise of leftist and communist political factions within the country in response to the specter of creeping  communism across the pacific the u.s enacted its reverse course policy for japan labor strikes were outlawed and public unions were forbidden from most forms of collective bargaining communist rioters in tokyo turned mayday into a nightmare as fanatical speakers whipped 400 000 workers and students into hysteria with anti-american speeches japan's socialist and communist political parties were criminalized and driven underground pro-western and pro-business politicians and even straight-up yakuza were  installed in the government by the u.s occupiers who would go on to form what is now the country's ruling liberal democratic party and as part of the reverse course article 9 was watered down and reinterpreted to allow japan to begin maintaining domestic armed forces and a navy the so-called jsdf or japanese self-defense forces [Music] all in the name of fighting communism when shinzo abe assumed the prime ministership of japan in 2012 as leader of the liberal democrats he made it one of his primary goals to see article 9  revised or repealed by 2014 and with the full support of the obama administration he had succeeded in bypassing the country's parliament article 9 was in effect reinterpreted to allow japan to go to war on behalf of its allies japan's government is currently gripped by a debate over full re-militarization the verdict will supposedly be rendered before the end of 2020. fully two-thirds of the japanese population rejects the plan to overturn article 9 but abe's ruling party may nevertheless get its way  many supporters of the article 9 revision claim that spending big on the military will boost the stagnant japanese economy and help the nation address its numerous social pathologies by instilling a shared sense of national pride and purpose in the citizenry but the true aim of this push for remilitarization has always been clear from the outset washington and western europe need another spear carrier for their proxy wars they would like nothing more than to see japan become a mercenary military force  with global reach the entirety of mgsv is a thesis statement against militarization and it does not mince words or try to both sides the argument right now in my own country we can see a very relevant and pertinent example of what happens when a nation enshrines war as its highest principle it begins with hatred and violence directed against external enemies but those chickens always come home to roost up history is rife with these examples of imperial force boomeranging back home from the praetorian guard of ancient  rome through to the schutzstaffel of nazi germany the violence we export abroad and our ceaseless lust for domination are intimately linked to the social collapse that we are experiencing at home war can only beget more war giving way to an endless spiral of violence this isn't just some head in the clouds philosophizing ripped from one of my japanese animes this is the world we're living in right now and metal gear predicted it all in 2021 the new start nuclear arms control treaty will expire for russia and the u.s there will no  longer be any restrictions on nuclear weapon development or deployment and the global disarmament movement will be effectively dead in the water with start gone the entire post-cold war arms control regime will disappear overnight and nothing will be there to stop every nation and private army from exploiting nuclear technology for their own ends i understand but why metal gear the nuclear age ended with the turn of the millennium oh you're wrong the threat of nuclear war isn't gone in fact it's greater than has ever been  the world will need a new common tongue a language of nukes my metal gears shall be the thread by which all countries are bound together the scientific industrial powers that concentrated unimaginable wealth in the hands of a global elite are the same things that now doom us whether through the threat of nuclear annihilation runaway climate change or plane deprivation like ahab and like snake we have bound ourselves to a doomsday machine that will grind ceaselessly forward until we are all crushed between its gears  cuba decalia afghanistan angola zaire mgsv uses these resource-rich locations as its setting for a very specific purpose every part of this stealth action sandbox is either a hotbed of proxy warfare or a colonized territory that is deeply scarred by imperial expansionism the earth's natural resources and indeed the very bodies of the people who inhabit these lands are nothing more than pawns in a game where all that matters is optimizing profit as you shuffled through endless screens of the game's human resources simulator  from hell mode did you even feel a twinge of guilt about how carelessly you're treating the lives of your soldiers about how casually and thoughtlessly you make decisions by which dozens of your own troops might die in battle because all you can see is the bottom line and you really need those resources to build a new platform for mother base anyway you the player venom snake are not the hero you are not a hero you're a sad and confused nameless nobody building someone else's legend and making someone else rich off your  blood and sweat whether that's big boss himself the deep state illuminati or the larger war economy that has parasitized the world you are fated to spend your life behind the gun until you die at the hands of the demons you helped unleash cypher will rewrite the records and i will vanish from human memory but the thirst for revenge that i have planted will infest the system no one can stop it now will unleash that thirst unto the future the most devious trick of this system of control is to convince us that it's all a choice  something we want for ourselves of our own free will but in reality it's just another day in a war without end [Music] when i was 14 during an all-night hangout with my high school's anime club we tore our way through the first metal gear solid over the course of one fateful night that game forever changed the way i look at cinematic storytelling and gaming itself when i was 15 mere weeks after 911 had turned our world upside down i sought refuge in mgs2 i fell deep into a techno-espionage thriller that forced me to confront how  my own love of escapism had blinded me to the powers that rule behind the scenes when i was 18 deeply depressed and fearful of the future the hope of playing mgs3 kept me alive the story of snake eater reminded me that the fires of war i was seeing rise around the world were not permanent today's enemy could become tomorrow's friend making our current notions of objective right and wrong seem utterly foolish when i was 22 i was taking my first tentative steps into a bigger world but the future had never looked more  precarious and uncertain mgs4 told me to let go of my fears that even if i felt trapped right now my life was not set in stone i could find my way as long as i kept hope alive when i was 29 the world had nearly broken me i was barely a year returned from my time in russia and it was clear that even though i was back home i could never be repatriated battling my demons and my addictions while working a terrible tech job that was slowly grinding the life out of me i was deep in a spiral of anger regret and  self-loathing you too have known loss and that loss torments you still you hope hatred i someday replace the pain but it never goes away it makes a man hideous inside and out and mgsv arrived right on time after playing through the game i spent a lot of time going full never be game over hunting for every spare bit of symbolism i could find playing and replaying the cinematics over and over trying to parse the meaning of every single cassette tape but something about the ending still didn't sit right there  was a lingering pain i could not account for a faint sorrow over the might of bins and could have beens you feel it too don't you i wanted to make them give back our past until finally the experience made me pause and consider the phantom pains i was carrying around just as i had carried the metal gear saga with me my entire life i felt so much pain and sorrow did i want to be haunted by loss and regret my entire life or was it time finally to move on it's over time for you to put aside the gun  and live [Music] [Applause] it all began with a bunch of old fools now they've all passed away their era of folly is over the world that the black mirror of metal gear presents to us a world of super soldiers and high-stakes nuclear espionage and ruthless men engaged in grim and bloody battle this is all an illusion one must die and one must live no victory no defeat the survivor will carry on the fight it is our destiny the one who survives will inherit the title of boss and the one who inherits the title of  boss will face in existence of endless battle to linger in this world of sorrow is to become consumed by it until you are haunted and tormented by the loss never able to reconcile your suffering this is the phantom pain of mgsv listen don't obsess of a word so much find the meaning behind the words then decide you can find your own name and your own future during one of the final narrative beats of mgsv venom is bitten by a poisonous snake and is then given an anti-venom the cycle completes and turns once more  venom will be neutralized and only a phantom pain will remain this meditation on duality is a thesis statement for the entire series you mustn't allow yourself to be chained to fate to be ruled by your genes humans can choose the type of life they want to live snake whether or not you're in the fox die program isn't important the important thing is that you choose life and then live this is a thread that's been present since the very first metal gear solid in each of these games the player is told to  live on your own terms and not on anyone else's orders pick up the torch so we can read our messy and sad history by its light learn to live by your own definitions of morality and to see the humanity in your enemies and to find a new lease on life even when you think you're trapped by the system mgsv is the final synthesis of these themes and the most timely of warnings to the player do not allow yourself to become ahab do not chase moby dick do not become consumed by your phantoms and regrets  do not linger in the past this is the true essence and core of metal gear and by extension all of kojima's work it's also the emotional through line of death stranding a game that is in so many other ways diametrically opposite of metal gear in both form and content and if you're not scared of death how can you value life and life is pretty fragile right now [Music] and yeah the old ways die hard but that's what's gonna have to happen if we're gonna come together and build a better america that gun will help you here  that's her words not mine it is the most vital of messages coming from the most unlikely of places the gap in the door that is the virtual worlds that we so adore mgs v challenges us to find the strength to reconcile the messy awful contradictions that are a part of being alive can we harmonize even the most seemingly opposite ideas and arrive at a greater higher synthesis can we stand tall on missing legs can we turn venom into an antidote can a silly sentimental and over-the-top stealth action game directed by gaming's  equivalent of paul verhoeven have something truly profound to say about war and the human condition can we turn a phantom pain into a new source of strength and can we turn a requiem into new life [Music] it's not over not yet [Music] [Applause] thank you for watching this video was the product of nearly five years of pondering writing rewriting and multiple trips back to the drawing board the world is in a bad place right now you don't need me to tell you that i hope that this kind of alternative  entertainment adds some meaning and uplift to your day-to-day during these terrible times it's been too long since my last video i know i was laid off from my full-time work in december

TODAY HOW WILL ISRAEL RESPOND AFTER IRAN LAUNCHES MAJOR ATTACK WITH DRONES AND MISSILES ON THE JEWISH STATE? WE'LL LOOK AT HOW ISRAEL MAY STRIKE BACK EVEN AS PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN SAYS THE US WILL NOT HELP ISRAEL RETALIATE. CHRIS MITCHELL WILL BRING US THE STORY FROM JERUSALEM. >> EVEN BEFORE THE IRANIAN ASSAULT ISRAEL WAS PREPARING FOR ANOTHER WAR AGAINST IRAN'S MOST POWERFUL PROXY GROUP HEZBOLLAH. WE'LL HAVE THAT FROM THE BORDER  BETWEEN ISRAEL AND LEBANON. HERE AT HOME AMERICANS ARE STRETCHING THEIR FINANCES AS INFLATION HAS BEEN DRIVING PRICES HIGHER FOR BASIC THINGS FOOD AND GAS. WE'LL SEE WHAT CONSUMERS HAVE TO DO JUST TO GET BY AND. IT'S A BIG HIT ON NETFLIX. A DOCU DRAMA SERIES ABOUT THE LIFE OF ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT FIGURES IN THE BIBLE MOSES. THESE STORIES AND MUCH MORE FOR YOU TODAY HERE ON NEWSWATCH. THIS IS CBN. >> AND WE BEGIN THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT DECIDING HOW TO RESPOND TO BIGGEST DRONE AND MISSILE ATTACK IN HISTORY.  AS CHRIS MITCHELL REPORTS FROM JERUSALEM, ISRAEL'S LEADERS ARE CONSIDERING THEIR OPTIONS WHILE ALLIES LIKE THE US ARE TRYING TO RESTRAIN ISRAEL'S MILITARY IN ITS FIRST DIRECT STRIKE BY IRAN AGAINST. IRAN ATTACKED WITH MORE THAN 300 DRONES CREWS AND BALLISTIC MISSILES. IT BROUGHT A 45 YEAR SHADOW WAR INTO THE LIGHT OF HISTORY TO TEST THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN IRAN AND ISRAEL'S CAPABILITIES ON STARK DISPLAY WITH REPORTS THAT ABOUT HALF OF THE PROJECTILES EITHER FAILED ON LAUNCH OR CRASHED BEFORE REACHING THEIR TARGETS.  THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE REST WERE DESTROYED BY ISRAEL AND ITS PARTNERS, INCLUDING U.S., FRANCE, BRITAIN, JORDAN AND SAUDI ARABIA. THE 99% INTERCEPTION RATE DESCRIBED AS A SPEC TACULAR MILITARY ACHIEVEMENT STUNNING VIDEO SHOWED SOME MISSILES BEING SHOT DOWN OVER JERUSALEM ON SUNDAY WAR CABINET MET TO DECIDE HOW TO RESPOND. BENNY SAID ISRAEL WILL RESPOND WHEN THE TIME IS RIGHT AND DEFENSE YOAV GALLANT URGED AN INTERNATIONAL COALITION AGAINST . >> REUTERS IS REPORTING THAT TURKEY ACTED AS A MEDIATOR  BETWEEN IRAN AND THE U.S. IT SAID IRAN INFORMED TURKEY IN OF THE OPERATION AND WASHINGTON TOLD TEHRAN THAT ANY ACTION IT TOOK HAD TO BE QUOTE WITHIN CERTAIN LIMITS. >> AFTER THE ATTACK, PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN AND PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU TALKED BY PHONE. BIDEN REPORTEDLY TOLD NETANYAHU YOU GOT TO WIN, TAKE A WIN AND URGED HIM TO CAREFULLY THINK THE CONSEQUENCES OF ANY RETALIATION. HE ALSO SAID THE U.S. WON'T PARTICIPATE IN ANY STRIKE AGAINST. >> THE PRESIDENT'S BEEN VERY CLEAR WE DON'T SEEK A WAR WITH  IRAN. WE'D NOT LOOKING FOR ESCALATION HERE. WE WILL CONTINUE TO HELP ISRAEL ITSELF. >> YET SOME U.S. LAWMAKERS SAY THE U.S. SHOULD SUPPORT AN ISRAELI RETALIATORY STRIKE. >> I THINK A RESPONSE HERE I THINK ONE OPTION WOULD BE TO TAKE OUT THE FACILITIES WHERE THESE DRONES AND ROCKETS CAME FROM AND ALSO THE MANUFACTURING FACILITIES THAT BUILD THE DRONES AND ROCKETS. >> WE NEED TO STAND WITH ISRAEL. ISRAEL NOT AT WAR WITH HAMAS OR HEZBOLLAH OR YEMEN. THOSE ARE ALL SURROGATES FOR FOR IRAN. >> THOSE ARE THEIR PROSTITUTES.  >> THE IS IRAN. ISRAEL IS ON WAR WITH IRAN. >> IRAN HATES AMERICA. IRAN HATES JEWS. IRAN WANTS TO KILL AMERICANS AND JEWS. >> FORMER ISRAELI AMBASSADOR THE U.N. AND KNESSET MEMBER DANNY DANON TOLD CBN NEWS HE BELIEVES A GREAT DEFENSE IS NOT ENOUGH. WE HAVE TO SHOW OR OUR OFFENSIVE CAPABILITIES IN TO CREATE DETERRENCE IN THE REGION AGAINST IRAN. THEY ATTACKED A SOVEREIGN COUNTRY WITH 300 ROCKETS, MISSILES AND UAV AND WE CANNOT SIT IDLY BY. MY POSITION IS THAT WE HAVE TO HIT THEM HOW TO TREAT THEM A  LESSON THAT THEY WILL NOT DO IT AGAIN WHILE THE ISRAELIS AND THEIR PARTNERS PRAISE THE AIR DEFENSE. SOME ALSO POINT TO THE POWER OF PRAYER IN PROTECTING THE JEWISH STATE. >> I WANT TO THANK ALL WHO WERE ABLE TO STAND WITH US. I THINK LAST TIME WHAT WE WAS IN THE HANDS OF GOD PROTECTING ISRAEL AS WELL. >> CBN CHUCK HOLTON SHARED HOW HE HOSTED A LIVE REPORT ON YOUTUBE IN THE MINUTES AFTER THE ATTACK STARTED AS THE ROCKETS AND DRONES WERE STILL FLYING TOWARD ISRAEL. SO BEFORE KNEW WHAT WOULD ACTUALLY TAKE PLACE WE HAD  THOUSAND PEOPLE ONLINE I BELIEVE AND WE WE PRAYED ALL TOGETHER 40,000 PEOPLE THAT'S A STADIUMS WORTH OF PEOPLE AS WE PRAYED THAT GOD WOULD THWART THE PLANS OF EVIL MEN. >> HE CAME THROUGH LAST NIGHT AND HE ANSWERED OUR PRAYER AND THAT'S A VERY THING THAT I THINK WE CAN FORGET. AMEN INDEED. CHRIS MITCHELL IS WITH US NOW FROM JERUSALEM. CHRIS, WE'LL TALK MORE ABOUT PRAYER IN JUST A MOMENT BECAUSE THAT IS SO CRUCIAL. BUT FIRST I WANT TO ASK YOU THE ISRAELI WAR CABINET REPORTEDLY BELIEVES THEY SHOULD STRIKE  BACK BUT THEY'RE DIVIDED OVER HOW DO IT. >> WHAT ARE YOU HEARING? >> WELL, YESTERDAY THEY MET FOR ABOUT 4 HOURS ONE DAY AND IN FACT IT APPEARS LIKE THE THEY'RE MEETING RIGHT NOW EXACTLY HOW THEY'RE GOING TO RESPOND. IT'S CLEAR THAT ISRAEL WILL RESPOND AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE IDF HAS PRESENTED PLANS AND OPTIONS THE WAR CABINET. YOU KNOW, WHETHER OR NOT HOW THEY DO THAT REMAINS TO BE SEEN. YOU KNOW, CONGRESSMAN BUT CALL SAID MAYBE THEY COULD STRIKE THOSE DRONES OR THE FACTORIES THAT BUILT THOSE AND THE  BALLISTIC MISSILES. THEY COULD ALSO STRIKE IRAN'S OIL PRODUCTION, EVEN ITS NUCLEAR SITES, SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT FOR YEARS COULD BE CYBER ATTACKS RIGHT NOW AND REPORTEDLY BENNY GANTZ WHO'S IN THE WAR CABINET AND ALSO RETIRED GENERAL GARY ISAAC EISENKOT SAID THEY RECOMMEND HITTING IRAN ACTUALLY WHILE THE ATTACK WAS UNDERWAY WHEN THEY HAVE TO. IT WAS QUITE A NIGHT FOR ISRAELIS THE OTHER NIGHT AND FOR MYSELF AND MANY OF US HERE IN THE BUREAU. MANY WERE WATCHING THE NEWS LITERALLY AS THE DRONES  AND MISSILES WERE ON THEIR WAY. I HAPPENED TO BE IN THE GALILEE AT THE TIME I WAS DRIVING BACK LATE AT NIGHT. I ARRIVED HERE JUST IN TO HEAR THE EXPLOSIONS OVER JERUSALEM OVER JERUSALEM. WOW. WELL, MANY ANALYSTS HERE IN THE US ARE SAYING THAT IRAN CROSSED A RED LINE, CHRIS, BY ATTACKING ISRAEL ITSELF FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME RATHER THAN GOING AFTER ISRAELI EMBASSIES THE COUNTRY. DOES THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT SEE IT THAT TOO THAT THIS WAS AN UNPRECEDENTED ATTACK BY IRAN? WELL, DEFINITELY UNPRECEDENTED  A HISTORIC ATTACK NO OTHER NATION HAS LAUNCHED SO MANY DRONES AND BALLISTIC AND CRUISE MISSILES AGAINST ANOTHER COUNTRY. SOME ARE SAYING IT MAY BE A STRATEGIC BY IRAN RIGHT NOW AND THEY MAY HAVE OVERPLAYED THEIR HAND. ONE EXPERT THAT I WAS TALKING TO SAID THEY RAFAH ON A SILVER PLATTER TO ISRAEL MEANING THAT THE ATTENTION IS NO LONGER ON GAZA BUT ON IRAN TEMPORARILY AT LEAST IT SEEMS LIKE ISRAEL HAS THE WORLD ON THEIR SIDE AND THIS KIND OF PUTS IRAN IN A BAD LIGHT INTERNATIONALLY. AND WHAT IT ALSO SHOWED, WENDY,  WAS THE FLAWS IN THEIR MISSILE PROGRAM. MANY, MANY OF THESE MISSILES NEVER MADE IT OUT OF IRAN. AND I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING I SAW ON SOCIAL MEDIA IN TERMS THE DRONES THAT AMAZON DELIVERIES ARE FASTER THAN SOME OF THEIR DRONES. >> OH, DEAR. WOW. THEY'RE NOT GOING TO LIKE THAT . ISRAEL CHRIS AND HIS ALLIES SHUT DOWN VIRTUALLY THE INCOMING DRONES AND MISSILES AS YOU JUST MENTIONED. BUT DO THOSE DEFENSIVE WEAPONS COST ISRAEL A LOT OF MONEY AND WHAT DO WE WHAT ELSE DO WE LEARN ABOUT ISRAEL'S DEFENSES?  >> YEAH, WELL THOSE INTERCEPTORS SOMETIMES THEY COST THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS, SOMETIMES TENS OF THOUSANDS JUST FOR ONE OF THOSE INTERCEPTORS. ON THE OTHER HAND, YOU HAVE RELATIVELY LOW COST DRONES COMING BUT THOSE MISSILES AS WELL. PART OF THE STRATEGY, WENDY, WAS OVERWHELM THE ANTI-MISSILE SYSTEM BUT ACTUALLY IT A TREMENDOUSLY IMPRESSIVE COUNTER STRATEGY THAT WAS BUILT OVER SEVERAL YEARS OF ANTI-MISSILE LAYERS BEGINNING WITH JORDAN. SAUDI ARABIA ALSO COORDINATION WITH THE U.K., THE US, FRANCE AND REALLY JUST AN IMPRESSIVE  LAYERS ANTI-MISSILE STRATEGY MANY OF THEM THOSE OF ALLIES. AND AS I NOTED, SOME OF THE ABRAHAM ACCORDS NATIONS LIKE THE UAE AND PERHAPS A FUTURE ABRAHAM ACCORDS NATION LIKE SAUDI ARABIA. >> CHRIS, WHAT'S THE RESPONSE THERE TO PRESIDENT BIDEN SAYING THE US WILL NOT HELP ISRAEL, IT RETALIATES AGAINST IRAN BECAUSE IN FACT IT WAS BLOCK SOME OF THOSE MISSILES. THE OTHER NIGHT, RIGHT? >> YEAH, WELL THEY'LL HELP DEFENSIVELY BUT THEY REALLY DON'T WANT TO GO ON THE OFFENSE THEY DON'T WANT TO BE OFFENSIVE  HAVE A OF AN OFFENSIVE ALONG WITH ISRAEL TO ATTACK AND COME AGAINST RETALIATE IRAN MAYBE GIVEN THEIR RESTRAINTS OVER GAZA IT'S NOT SURPRISING AND THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION GOING BACK TO THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION AND OF THE SAME OFFICIALS ARE IN BOTH BOTH CABINETS. THERE IS A HISTORY OF APPEASEMENT WITH IRAN. NOW SOME HAVE TOLD ME THAT THERE'S MAYBE AN OPPORTUNITY GIVEN THE FAVOR THAT ISRAEL HAS JUST TEMPORARILY MAYBE THE RESTORED THEY CAN RESTORE THOSE SANCTIONS ON IRAN AND AND BUT THE QUESTION IS WHEN THEY IF  ISRAEL DOES ATTACK WHERE IT'S GOING TO BE WHEN IT'S GOING TO BE AND WHAT'S GOING TO BE AGAINST. >> AND CHRIS, HOW DOES ALL OF THIS AFFECT THE WAR AGAINST? THERE'S A REPORT FROM AN ISRAELI BROADCASTER THAT PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU HAS DECIDED TO POSTPONE THE INVASION OF RAFAH. HAVE YOU HEARD ANYTHING ALONG THOSE LINES? WELL, WE'VE ALSO HEARD THAT THEY'VE CALLED UP TWO RESERVE BRIGADES. I HAVE HEARD THAT. BUT I'VE ALSO HEARD, WENDY, THAT MAYBE WE'RE IN THE EARLY OF OF TRYING TO GET INTO RAFAH. AND AS I SAID BEFORE, IT'S  POSSIBLE THAT THE SHIFT HAS GONE FROM GAZA TO IRAN AND PERSON I TALKED TO EARLIER SAID IT MAY HAVE PUT RAFAH ON A SILVER PLATTER FOR ISRAEL. >> CHUCK HOLTON TALKED ABOUT THE PRESSURES THAT WERE GOING UP FOR ISRAEL AND THE ROLE IT PLAYED IN PROTECTING THAT COUNTRY. WHAT WHAT ARE RELIGIOUS LEADERS IN ISRAEL SAYING ABOUT WHAT WHAT HAPPENED? WELL, YOU KNOW, WHEN THE ISRAEL'S FIRST PRIME MINISTER BEN-GURION FAMOUSLY SAID IN ISRAEL TO BE A REALIST YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE IN MIRACLES AND MANY PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT WHAT  HAPPENED OTHER NIGHT WAS JUST MIRACULOUS WITHOUT TAKING ANYTHING AWAY FROM THE ANTI-MISSILE DEFENSE SET UP FOR YEARS. IT WAS ALMOST BIBLICAL THE OUTCOME OF LAST LAST THAT NIGHT 350 PROJECTILES. 99% RATE OF SHOOTING HIM DOWN. MANY PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT WAS A MIRACLE THAT WE SAW IN ACTION AND NO NO CASUALTIES, JUST ONE CASUALTY. >> IT'S ACTUALLY A SEVEN YEAR OLD BEDOUIN GIRL WAS TRAGICALLY HIT BY THAT. BUT BUT THAT WAS ABOUT IT AND VERY, VERY LITTLE PHYSICAL DAMAGE. >> WHILE IT DID SEEM LIKE THE HAND OF GOD WAS OUTSTRETCHED  OVER ISRAEL AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO PRAY. CHRIS MITCHELL FROM THANKS AS ALWAYS FOR YOUR INSIGHTS. PLEASE STAY SAFE AND KNOW MANY PEOPLE ARE PRAYING FOR YOU AND OUR STAFF THEIR INJURIES. >> AND GOD BLESS YOU. WELL, COMING UP WHILE ISRAEL IS FOCUSED ON IRAN AFTER THE ATTACK OVER THE WEEKEND, IT'S ALSO BEEN PREPARING FOR WAR ON ITS NORTHERN BORDER WITH CALL 800 7389698 800 7389698 800 7389698. AS ISRAEL IS DEALING WITH HOW TO STRIKE AGAINST IRAN ALSO BEEN KEEPING A CLOSE EYE ON TEHRAN'S MOST POWERFUL ARMY  HEZBOLLAH IN SOUTHERN LEBANON. GEORGE TRAVELED TO THE BORDER CITY OF KIRYAT KIRYAT SHMONA BEFORE THE IRANIAN ATTACK AND BRINGS US THIS STORY. >> THEY LOOK. >> YES. TOBY ABBOTT KNOWS JUST HOW FORTUNATE HE IS TO BE STILL ALIVE. FEBRUARY 13TH AT 1108 IN THE MORNING ABBOTT WAS DRIVING DOWN STREET IN QUIET SHEMONA, A CITY IN NORTHERN ISRAEL LEBANON'S BORDER WHEN HIS CAR'S DASHCAM CAPTURES THE MOMENT A HEZBOLLAH MISSILE LANDS A FEW AWAY FROM HIM. >> I WAS DRIVING ON THE STREETS OF THE CITY AND AN ANTI-TANK  MISSILE HITS RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME WITH NO WARNING. THERE WASN'T EVEN A SIREN SOUND WARNING OF AN INCOMING MISSILE. HE IMMEDIATELY STOPS, PUTS CAR IN A PARK, TURNS ON THE HAZARD LIGHTS, JUMPS OUT AND TAKES COVER HIS CAR. >> 10 SECONDS LATER THE SECOND MISSILE HITS INJURING A AND HER CHILD. AND THEN COME THE SIRENS. THREE MONTHS EARLIER ON NOVEMBER SECOND, HEZBOLLAH LAUNCHED A BARRAGE OF 12 MISSILES AT NORTHERN. TWO OF THE MISSILES HITTING RIGHT NEXT TO ABBOTT BULLETS. SURVEILLANCE VIDEO SHOWS THE  MOMENT HIS FATHER TWO SIBLINGS ENTERED THE FAMILY RESTAURANT AND THE MISSILES IMPACT FLEEING THEM TO THE FLOOR BUT NOT SERIOUSLY INJURED. >> IT WAS SCARY. MY LITTLE SISTERS AND FATHER WERE HERE WITH ME BUT WE QUICKLY GOT INTO THE BUNKER AND WE UNDERSTOOD THAT THERE'S NO ROOM FOR GAMES. >> THIS IS VERY SERIOUS. FIVE MONTHS LATER HE'S NERVOUS ABOUT WHAT'S COMING. I BELIEVE ISRAEL AND HEZBOLLAH ARE GOING TO GO TO WAR. >> THE TRAFFIC HERE IN DOWNTOWN KIRYAT SHMONA ARE BLINKING BECAUSE THERE'S AS YOU CAN SEE,  HARDLY ANY TRAFFIC TO SPEAK OF. IT'S A SCENE THAT IS PLAYED OUT PRETTY MUCH ALL THE ISRAEL LEBANON BORDER. SOME 60,000 ISRAELIS ARE FORCED TO EVACUATE FROM CITIES LIKE THIS. BUT YOU KNOW, BACK IN 2006 WHEN ISRAEL AND HEZBOLLAH WERE LAST WAR, THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND THE SITUATIONS WERE MUCH DIFFERENT AND TODAY HEZBOLLAH IS A MUCH MORE POWERFUL ARMY. >> WHAT IS DIFFERENT ABOUT THIS CONFLICT COMPARED TO 2006 IS BY DIFFERENT HEZBOLLAH IS MUCH STRONGER, MUCH MORE MUNITION ACCURATE MISSILES AND CAPABILITY OF INVASION EVERY  DAY. >> FORMER IDF INTELLIGENCE SARI ZAHAVI IS A LEADING EXPERT ON HEZBOLLAH. SHE'S TRACKED THE VARIOUS WEAPONS BEING USED BY THE TERROR GROUP HERE IN THE NORTH SINCE OCTOBER 8TH, THE DAY AFTER THE HAMAS MASSACRE. IN ADDITION TO MORE THAN 3000 ROCKETS, ZAHAVI SAYS FOR THE FIRST TIME HEZBOLLAH BEGAN MORE ADVANCED IRANIAN MADE WEAPONS LIKE THE ALMAS ONE ANTI-TANK GUIDED MISSILE LOW LONG LONG FLYING SHORT RANGE, VERY ACCURATE. >> NO ALERT, NO IRON DOME CANNOT INTERCEPT IS NOT PROTECT ITSELF FROM THE INFRARED ONLY  ONLY IF THEY ARE LAUNCHED AGAINST TANKS BUT THEY ARE USUALLY LAUNCHED AGAINST EVERYTHING ELSE. EVERYTHING NOT JUST EVERYTHING CIVILIAN, MILITARY, WHATEVER. >> IN JANUARY HEZBOLLAH RELEASED THIS VIDEO REPORTEDLY SHOWING ALMA ONE WITH A CAMERA ATTACHED TO ITS NOSE TARGETING IDF INTELLIGENCE BASE INSTEAD OF A TERRORIST ORGANIZATION.

P184	https://youtu.be/m6ISoGg5MfM?si=7Egar7E7H2cYUZHr	getting on the open show thanks for watching thank you for joining us here in our our studio on Hollywood are from your homes around the world oh you know what I have to say that makes me feel very good you know so much of every day now is a fight we're arguing uh we're criticizing we're at each other's throats there's so much unpleasantness I thought it might be nice to start with some good news for a change okay OJ was cremated [Applause] today too soon okay and we have a new trial of the century to replace his the people of New  York versus Donald Trump so far the people are winning um our friend sleepy donzalesko from websites that he feels make the case that there is no case I've been here all day on a trial that really is a very unfair trial these are all stories this is over the last few days from legal experts as this Wall Street Journal editorial but all of these are stories from legal experts saying how this is not a case I think this big sack of papers none of you can read speaks for itself folks take a look at all of these are  our stories you see them here uh they call a zombie case meaning it is no case the whopping outrage and drums and Di it's a whopping outrage and it is an outrage everybody's outrage right yeah no I'm not I love it I am not even the tiniest bit outrage but go on wow that's New York Magazine even all of them they just came out these are all every single one I haven't seen one that says it's a good trve and I'm sitting here for days now from morning till night in that freezing room freezing everybody was freezing in  there w w w motion to get the defendant some tiny mittens your honor Trump hasn't been that cold since the last time he was in bed with Melania I have to say a little worried about him this is what Trump looked like at the defense table to now I want you to note the difference between the color of his hands and the color of his face we did not doctor this those are his hands and his face those Shades aren't even on the same Sherwin Williams color palette looks like a cantaloupe wearing batting gloves or something here's how  one potential juror described him shortly after she was dismissed what was your impression of of Donald Trump when you saw him um you know he looked less orange uh definitely like more yellow yellow um nothing else than that he looks uh he doesn't look angry or I think he looks bored he's yellow and boor like a minion or something somehow even with two seated jurors being dismissed today one because she felt her identity had been compromised they managed to find 12 jurors and one alternate each  prospective juror had to answer question about what they think about Trump which meant he had to sit there and listen to comments like this one from a woman who said um she said I wouldn't believe Trump if his tongue were notorized I you know that that woman she did not get picked as a juror but I would like to hire her as a writer if she's interested the jury in this now the jury is picked by both sides the prosecution and the defense get to knock people out if they don't want them on the jury but  the Maga media they're doing everything they can to push this idea that it won't be a fair trial that way when he loses they can say oh it was rigged the jury pool is is so tainted here they are catching undercover liberal activists lying to the judge people will probably lie just to get on this jury no one on Earth not anyone honest with thems anyway believes that Donald Trump is going to get a fair trial in New York how in the world will this man ever get a fair jury there's no such thing as a  fair trial when Manhattan is 90% Democrat you have a 20-year-old white girl who works for Disney and likes to dance who who this looks like trouble let's look at jur number two uh gets the news from The New York Times and Google I don't really trust anybody that gets their news from The New York Times or Google I'm not so sure about jur number two jur number three is a young Asian lawyer from Oregon he's single lives in Chelsea and was wearing a purple jacket whoa a purple jacket I mean you know who  wears a purple jacket The Joker wears a purple jacket you know who wears a purple jacket come here this lady right here in our audience put him away and while um half of the Fox network is busy screaming about how unfairly Trump gets treated in New York when Da West took a little field trip to a bodega in Harlem on Tuesday his foxy friends bent over almost literally backwards to talk about how much New Yorkers love him a group of women up the block called for yelled at Donald Trump in Spanish and  they were calling him my tiger so they were referring to Donald Trump as my tiger and then employees of the Romantic Depot which apparently is a lingerie store in that neighborhood well waved a red banner advertising a product named after Donald Trump I have no idea what that is what that product is well I know what it is I know exactly what it is that product and this is not a joke we confirm this with the shop that product is this Trump dildos on sale now that's the product at the Romantic Depot and what  could be more romantic than a Depot you know poor Rudy Giuliani is at home going hey dildo stores are my thing that's where I meanwhile in Congress the animals Trump Unleashed are now threatening their own speaker Mike Johnson you know the guy who looks like a kid dressed as an adult for the school play he is being uh threatened with removal by a group of hard- brained Republicans who are angry because he's backing a military aid package that would send money to Ukraine being the Speaker of the House nowadays is like  being Leonardo DiCaprio's girlfriend you hang on as long as you can just try to enjoy the ride but they formed what they call a floor action response team or F for short so you know these are very serious people they're the these Americans are on Russia's side and they're led by none other than Clan mom Marjorie Taylor green who's determined to pave the way for Putin even at the expense of Mike Johnson's head it's unprecedented this is never happened in history and it's completely wrong he owes our conference the truth  and he owes Republicans answers does that mean you go forward today will you go forward today I'm waiting to I'm waiting to find out what's going to happen what's holding you back uh I'm a responsible person yeah marjerie you are neither responsible nor are you a person but right now her side project is putting space lasers at the border for real this is what she wants to do this party is insane somehow Mike Johnson man who called Planned Parenthood part of an American Holocaust isn't right-wing  enough for these people Mike Johnson a climate change denying homophobic religious fanatic knows that getting Ukraine these weapons is the right thing to do and even though his party is terrified of jello Putin lover Trump he's doing it anyway and that's why they're going to destroy him they can't have that if they let him do the right thing on Ukraine he might do the right thing on other stuff it's a very slippery slope but so but we have more important subjects to focus on right Gio because the new Taylor Swift album drops yeah  and and so and we still have to work tomorrow which tomorrow should be a holiday right I mean are we really going to make people drive after pulling all nighters listening to Taylor Swift please be careful out there tomorrow Taylor Swift's album isn't the only major release this month it's the biggest but we also got a new single a couple weeks ago for from uh RNC co-chair and former first daughter-in-law Laura Trump today America finally got the genre bending musical release it was waiting foring that  girl riding on theas tell her everything's going be all right there she is Taylor not too Swift um well now I feel like that sounded terrible but maybe I'm biased I don't know I recused myself from this jury and I turn it over to the people we went to the farmers market here in Los Angeles we told Shoppers strolling by we had a sneak preview of a new album from a big artist and we wanted to get their thoughts on it and we played them a song from Laura Trump but and then told him it was the new Taylor Swift We have a  leak track from a top artist we won't tell you who it is do you want to take a listen to it now and tell us your honest thoughts okay brutally honest honest reactions from people okay yes I can be brutally honest you sure can okay sure let's do ITP you can't give up know that is honestly it's I don't know who that is it's not very good the pitch was pretty pretty off to be honest they were off yeah the whole time if I'm being honest it does sound really really robotic more like AI that's terrible  it is Taylor Swifts from her new album The tortured poets Department doesn't even sound like her you seem surprised yeah I've been waiting for this album oh my god really yeah did she hurt her voice no way we I'm a Swifty heer I'm sorry I I don't want to offend the swifties but uh that single worst thing that she has ever released that I have personally listened to with my ears yes she sounds sick she sound like she got a little flim or something like might be some drink you know she might be drinking too  much maybe smoking a little weed something I don't know but it sound like some mucus in there I I don't think it's up to her usual standard of quality who it actually is is Laura Trump the daughter-in-law of Donald Trump see that makes way more sense oh okay well no wonder it sounds bad no wonder it sound yeah that would make sense sorry Taylor are you relieved to know it wasn't her yeah cuz Taylor I love her but that is not that's not my girl do you think she has a future in music nah she's not going to make  it sucks if you had to describe the song in three words what three words would you pick unhinged unnecessary unethical nily bad sad annoying basic mediocre three words try again is POS well sorry laa whatever your politics I think we can all agree she has a terrible voice and now one more thing before we Barrel ahead it's Thursday night it's is time to bleep and blur the big TV moments of the week it is time for this week in unnecessary censorship over in Memphis a man was arrested for allegedly trying to rob a store with a  snake around his you cannot prevent a defendant froming the witnesses froming the judge's daughter this is very simple I'm operating with the smallest in US history my hooa is going to be those aren't my words because I'm pretty sure I'm not allowed to say that on TV tonight new video of two men ancient rock formations here in the west I I've rarely seen this level of evil in my career and I two Nazis 100% guarantee I'll be the best you ever try my it's awesome and I also happen to some some animals particularly  dogs cats um horses

news a lot lately this is a dangerous man it's pandering a little bit one of them racists horrible working conditions it was venomous it's disgusting and it is vile you believe it's plausible that Stephen Crowder is just a monster [Music] there's nothing I love more than bad stand-up comedy nothing fascinates me as much as watching some overconfident  drunk idiot get up in front of a packed crowd on Open Mic nights and just letting it rip yeah it's almost incredible how bad you are I don't think enough people appreciate the genuine level of intellect timing and planning that goes into crafting a well thought out joke it's a talent and it's not hard to see who has it and who doesn't I'll pick some Mexican cookies and you go over them like some Mexican cookie what are you talking about it's like a chocolate chip with sauce all over it what are you talking  about not everyone is cut out for such an industry but that doesn't keep them from trying so I drove here notice a really disturbing Trend in cars nowadays I'm looking folks have seen these uh dream catchers is this is this thing working okay thank you sir if your stand-up career doesn't work out that's okay you can always pivot to selling overpriced mugs and t-shirts that totally don't have slurs written on them the Che Guevara socialism is for figs T-shirt If you found yourself spewing incoherent  drivel to make up for an evident lack of talent then your name might be Steven Crowder a man who refers to underage girls as tweets about wanting to have sex with his mom I guess and threatens his pregnant wife when he thinks no one is watching I love you sick watch it watch it see Stephen was once a leading figurehead of the online conservative movement respected by his peers and adored by his audience until a series of allegations made by former friends family and colleague needs a tarnish to his good name even in the  eyes of fans his own comment sections have gone from endearing words of support to complete disdain just over the past month alone but if you've been following Stephen as long as I have then you know these instances are just as much horrifying as they are consistent with his public Persona a wannabe comedian who failed so hard at his craft that he sought out alternative means to fulfill his incessant need to be liked being paid Millions to show chaos and contribute to what makes political spaces so poisonous in the first place  but before we get to all of that we do have a sponsor the spoke post the spoke post is a monthly membership club delivering box of awesome

yeah unfortunately back to this  guy I've actually known about Steven Crowder for a long time considering when I was 14 I used to watch Steven's videos yeah I know I know okay don't come for me yet let me explain I was brought up in a Christian conservative household and when I was given internet access I wanted to watch somebody who said things I was used to hearing regarding guns climate change and Obama not that I actually understood any of those issues but at 14 I didn't care about challenging my perspective on the world I wanted somebody who would  reinforce it someone who would validate it and Stephen Crowder was that Stephen's shallow dichotomy of Republican good Democrat bad satisfied the confirmation bias I was at the time searching for and that's ultimately one of the things Steven is best at presenting a right-leaning perspective in a way that's easy for the Youth to digest in fact he's long been accredited for putting a young face on conservatism which is different from the old white guy club that people see too often at least according to Chris lash a friend  of Stevens and husband of NRA spokesperson and local psycho who once compared gun owners to rape victims Dana lash another Rider critical of Stephen echoed a similar sentiment when he told The Daily Beast in 2013 Stevens being promoted because he provides a very good face for the right wing to reassure its older generation the 20-somethings don't really support gay marriage and aren't concerned about income inequality in the beginning Stephen carved out a niche for himself where he could be easily seen as  a more modern breed of conservative while still very much holding the same views as an older generation of pundits that were being increasingly seen as out of touch as Steven could reach young people in a way that Glenn Beck and Rush Limbaugh no longer could 866 Gold Line my n-word that doesn't really because Steven wasn't strictly a political guy no he actually denounced that label from the very beginning Stephen Crowder has always been a self-described cultural person whatever that means and would  rather think of himself first and foremost as an actor and of course comedian sorry but I'm making you watch a stand up with me if I had to see it sunny you you're ugly but if you're ugly you take the Greyhound bus Troy Behar is so mind-numbingly stupid that you could be sitting across from her talking with her and not even having the same conversation well Miss Baker I think this dead is getting out of control I don't think that we should be passing it down to our children I know [Applause] no I mean I'm just saying that you know  we're passing a debt down onto our children pancakes keep in mind this is the kind of stuff he whips out when he really needs a laugh well better his nuts apparently but we'll get to that later this might shock you but Steven isn't exactly known for a comedy that challenges the way we think Biden sharks and sharks most of his act consists of making pretty mundane observations you guys seen this it's a Native American Indian contraction consists of wooden hoops and Feathers supposed to help you out sleep  already agrees with his politics 911. in finding ways to show off his world-renowned impressions of other races which honestly he still can't really do so you get these Middle Eastern wannabe thugs they're nice people but you can't pull off the thug look like oh oh you know what I am going to mess you up hey check out the German white boy I want my nut on the left side yes that's the side they're cruising down the street for chicks like I won't show you anymore because I am against cruel and unusual punishment but  for what it's worth part two of his act only got about 20 of the views that his first part got so if that doesn't tell you everything you need to know about his theater skills maybe we should take a look at his IMDb page where you can read about his breakout role on it you ready for this get ready Arthur what would you think of me if I ever got anything wrong yes it's hard to believe my first exposure to this man was when he voiced the brain on a show my sister and I grew up watching and to make it  even more surreal one of the episodes is literally about brain trying to become a comedian and failing changed I need to be practical and train myself for a new career in comedy you're going to be a comedian I just smashed an atom are you crazy no just practical and willing to face facts [Music] though he's crying over spilled milk stop him you've got to do something fast before he humiliates himself ironically Stephen was predicting the rest of his career with this one as he struggled to find work outside of Arthur with the  exception of a few minor roles in the late 2000s including the jot character in a Pure Flix movie and an appearance in the feature film directed by his brother Jordan where he pretty much just plays himself double standard it's like the women's rights thing is a double standard like now they have oh but now we're not allowed to hit them the Stevens and media career wasn't exactly popping off in the way he may have hoped but that's not to say there wasn't an audience for his style of entertainment see despite growing up in  Canada Steven was always interested in American politics and it was only a matter of time before Steven launched his own YouTube channel weighing in on whatever political matters were relevant at the time you really can't find anything funny about this Administration when Joe freaking Biden as vice president oh yeah it's like having Rain Man as vice president yeah definitely that definitely make a better VP than Joe Biden Hillary Clinton Rainman make better VP than Joe Biden this stuff was so quality Steven  eventually caught the attention of big Hollywood no not Hollywood big Hollywood was an affiliate of Breitbart News The Fringe right wing News website accredited for giving your grandparents a computer virus turns out Breitbart and PJ TV never even nerd of that one we're pretty big fans of what Stephen was doing over on YouTube in 2008 and don't worry I took the liberty of diving into the dark vat of Steven's old content so you don't have to Pelosi on Elm Street the nightmare continues now whether Steven wants to  admit it or not conservative comedy isn't the most competitive industry given how most mainstream Comics entertainers and even musicians are typically left-leaning meaning Steven never had to try as hard to get noticed given the path that he chose for himself was always so narrow before long he was being recruited to do stand-up at various Republican conferences making his long-awaited rap debuted CPAC 2012 with the single Mr America I think I'll just let you be the judge of this one America don't you run away  yeah but right now you're high hey ain't you big hitter but now I'm back from the dead I'm bringing back on my what knickers no it's okay I can say knickers because I wear knickers great job Stephen your tireless effort to engage the youth in America is encouraging I want to hear this on the radio better than anything else on the radio right now I guess it's time to give rap music a second look I can't do this man in 2009 Stephen Crowder landed a job as the youngest media correspondent at Fox News at that  point he had climbed the ladder from YouTube to obscure propaganda sites and finally to the biggest Cable News Network in the country cutting his teeth on extremely pretentious op-eds that have aged absolutely tragically in light of recent revelations in one bizarrely judgmental article titled A waiting till the wedding night getting married the right way Steven writes as anyone who's read my apps and its column here at Fox News opinion could guess sorry just what an incredible sequence of words that is  my wife and I not only waited sexually in every way we courted each other in a way that was consistent with our publicly professed values we did it the right way now of course Steven is referring to a personal choice that he and his wife made together saving sex for marriage is a completely fine and acceptable thing to do just as it's also fine and acceptable to have sex before marriage my hot take is that there isn't a right or wrong way to do it it just as long as you and your partner are on the  same page everyone is different and that's fine but Steven disagrees going on to write that he doesn't care if you feel judged since he and his wife were apparently mocked all the time people laughed scoffed and poked fun at the Young celibate naive Christian couple we'd certainly never make it to the wedding without stuffing looking back I think the women saying those things have felt like the floozies they ultimately were and the men with their fickle manhood tied to their pathetic sexual Conquest felt threatened side note but  Steven might possibly be the worst writer I've ever seen and he's writing it on their honeymoon sorry babe I'll be there in a sec finishing up my Fox News abstinence column before we can get to stuffing I don't want to focus too much in this one article though since we still have so much else to cover but for Steven to assume the role of an authoritative figure on the concept of marriage morally grandstanding on anyone who may have had a different experience than him only for it to be revealed that  he's been abusing his wife behind the scenes for years tells you everything you need to know about Stephen Crowder this article is an embarrassing read not just because it's littered with incomprehensible slang from what I can only assume is the 1920s but because it perfectly encapsulates everything Steven represents a reality in which he conceals his ugly intentions behind a wall of judgment hate and hypocrisy in an attempt to spread an ideology and he's been doing it forever [Music] in December 2012 the conservative  advocacy group Americans for Prosperity funded by two billionaire Brothers by the way crashed a protest in Michigan regarding the states recently passed to anti-union right to work law with the help of Stephen Crowder the group of right-wingers erected a giant tent in an effort to aggravate union members who were there protesting causing a dispute that resulted in Stephen getting punched in the face by a union worker while the full unedited footage showed the man being first pushed to the ground before  getting back up and decking Steven in the jaw this crucial bit had been mysteriously left out of the version Stephen both to do his channel for some reason making it seem like the man had attacked him unprovoked this was not only the narrative Steven tried to spin on Fox but the edited clip ended up being the one sent in to the Ingham County prosecutor's office in an attempt to press charges against the union worker dunning's question why Crowder didn't initi they provide the original footage to dunning's office I'm not  holding that against them but why would they provide the edited video the longer video clearly shows the guy got pushed down and came up swinging I think that's the polite way of the prosecutor saying they tried to provide us with false evidence though after reviewing the unedited version prosecutors ultimately ruled the man in fact acted in self-defense and dropped the case so at the end of the day this was all just Stephen Crowder whining on national TV about an event that he and his own group instigated  that's right I saw that guy's back go down and then he came up off yeah there he is what is that Steve he did go down you deserved sir you deserved your reunions are being swallowed these are babies flailing before being put to bed they are violent this was not an isolated event look around you man Stephen was finally dropped by Fox News only a few months later for reasons that are still up in the air to this day some say it has to do with contract negotiations While others insist it was because of comments he made about their  biggest on-screen Talent at the time Sean Hannity most hilarious to me is when one senior employee at Fox told The Daily Beast that Stephen was never that funny anyway and crossed a line more than a few times do you have any idea how obnoxious you need to be for even Fox News to turn against you to have insult to injury least Twitter messages from Fox's very own Greg Gutfeld seem to allude to how frankly unlikable Steven was on a private personal level keep in mind that these messages are all alleged  as I can't personally verify them myself but it is worth noting that Gutfeld has yet to deny or disprove their legitimacy plus they kinda already fall in line with Steven's public personas so just let me be messy here for a second they're funny okay he has issues I met him at a bar once and he sat Indian style on the floor in the middle of a crowded bar he was asking me what he thought of the looks of his fiancee how up is that she is beautiful but he couldn't judge it was like he was shopping for a car and was asking his  friend to take it for a test drive I nodded and wondered how I got into this mess adding it me thinks he hasn't issue with his sexuality which is fine but it's so obvious to everyone but him he was only at Fox News for like six months we all hated him he acts like he was a badass who left Fox no none of us could stand him he wants to be a star and hates everyone who took that risk and he didn't he calls himself a comedian but doesn't perform that's how the Schumer thing started I would not let him call  himself a comedian on my show and Amy knew that I hated him for saying he performs what Gutfeld is alluding to here is an old episode from his show where Steven and Amy Schumer were both guests and as you can probably imagine having these two in a room together didn't go well and you know you slip by the the dirty comedian thing but honestly you call yourself that much like I go fishing at cutter but I don't introduce from that moment Stephen would make it a priority to slam Amy Schumer from the  comfort of his own Studio any chance he got in a crusade that you cannot tell me wasn't a tiny bit personal by the way Amy Schumer you're a fat role model taking pride in being a fat bag of potatoes she's the guy she accuses all the guys of being only she's way gross grosser and fatter I'm fat ah snacks triggering the libs though would become the focal point of his new show on YouTube a louder with Crowder launched soon after it's falling out with Fox and this is where you really get some of the  most potent feminist owned videos that plagued all of YouTube in 2016. hey feminists with its first viral video being hashtag sjw feminist Festival crashed by Crowder in underwear prove once and for all that not all feminists are fat unattractive boy cut it androgynous amoebas oh my God epic editing there Stephen why he needed to go the extra mile and strip down to his underwear is beyond my reasoning at least I think him being removed has less to do with them being offended or whatever and more to do with Steven  intentionally irritating and causing a scene on purpose just to get a reaction for the internet let's talk about male body shaming should I be ashamed it's not even about politics at a certain point it's just about Stephen being a public nuisance that nobody wants to be around but after racking up a juicy 30 million views Stephen and his producer are not gay Jared which is a totally normal thing to call your friend by the way but make a habit of crashing these left-leaning events for the sole aim of  exposing the liberal agenda according to them but if you ask me it was mostly an excuse for Steven to dress up as a woman as he liked to do over and over and over and over and over I'm not going to keep going but it is funny that for a guy who thinks trans people are grooming your kids Steven sure can't get enough of wearing his wife's clothes and touching his producer in front of children like the time he and not gay Jared convinced a bunch of people at a feminist rally that they were trans women and were met  with uh kindness and support by the people there we quickly found out that nobody questions criticizes nor runs security background checks on trains that's what he grabs back nice going Stephen you really own those feminists by lying to them and taking advantage of their Hospitality for cheap clicks you definitely look like the reasonable person in this picture in case it says it's hard to tell these videos on louder with Crowder really didn't contain much substance outside of Steven working backwards from an already established  conclusion to prove some kind of flawed hypothesis sometimes that not even he understands what it is he's truly arguing for take for example his position on trans athletes she even personally wants to see trans people competing in sports with the gender they were assigned to at Birth it's something he's long propagated across his platforms but here he is complaining about just that this is Mark bags a senior from Euless Trinity High School near Dallas is in the process of transitioning from female to male and  taking low dose of testosterone I just entered a high school wrestling tournament with an undefeated record and surprise one that picture says a thousand words right Hey Stephen that is a trans man competing with CIS women he's being forced to compete with women because that's what people like you are arguing for this is what you want and this trans wrestler in particular Mac Beggs has openly expressed wanting to compete with cisman because it just makes more sense but he can't do that because republican-backed Texas law currently  requires trans athletes to play in an athletic league which matches their biological sex determined at Birth something that Stephen encourages and supports my position is biological males compete with biological males biological females compete with biological females like Stephen if you're watching first of all hi what the did you mean by this tweet and secondly just suspend your political bias for a minute and imagine if there were hundreds of bills circulating around the country invalidating your right to live a normal  life imagine if your basic Access to Health Care education legal recognition Etc was all up in the air for a small group of politicians to dictate something about that seems a wildly big government to me a gross overstep of legislative power but the small government conservative like yourself should frown upon but Stephen Crowder and the dozens of other vocal opponents of trans rights freedom of expression is trumped by blind hatred for those that are just different from them despite Freedom being one of the deciding  factors that makes America the best country in the world according to Stephen not only do I believe that our Health Care system is superior to those countries uh but there would be another reason outside of healthcare let's assume that Healthcare were better in those countries um freedom but it's just he doesn't believe everyone deserves the same access to the fundamental freedoms he's been given at least that's what it seems Stephen doesn't seem to Value those he personally deems inferior and would  rather resort to ostracizing them in a public setting the same way he was ostracized and bullied as a child oh but don't you feel a little bad for the bully he's just a kid I I feel zero bad for him and you know what happens when bullies aren't stepped down early in their childhood Gaddafi you'd hope someone like Stephen who has talked about being on the receiving end of Relentless bullying throughout his life would be one to stand up for those who have been unfairly attacked for committing the cardinal sin of trying to  live a normal life like the rest of us but instead Stephen takes the low road and chooses to Relish in the power he now gets to wield as the bully himself I think it's better the bully learn his lesson now as opposed to later on in life when somebody snaps as an adult it gets uglier this is Stephen Crowder a man who ironically brags about his strong Christian values likes to spend his time berating people who strangely aren't white by threatening to call Ice on Mexican workers I need papers do you  have papers he's gonna call ICE you Stephen and Joyce showing off his impression of Martin Luther King Jr five things you don't know about MLK bet you didn't expect to hear MLK and crack I have a dream of non-crack hoes at a motel six and when he's not making a mockery of black Farmers I don't know where you find this many farmers of color I planted a Hennessy tree but it's not growing turns out the uh the the the the soil content is a high level of meth crazy wow I didn't know he's disingenuously recreating George Floyd's  murder in an attempt to exonerate the psychopath convicted of killing him was it unpleasant yes is there any way that that would kill someone who was in moderate health I I can't see it Stephen's been known to make a mockery of Asian people on the sole premise of them being Asian aggressively Asian face when he's not wearing a dress or cosplaying as a root and tootin sheriff with this fake little gun holsters in his Studio he's poking fun at whatever he thinks Islam is Islam the religion of peace  excusing the torture America inflicted against prisoners at Guantanamo Bay I personally believe that prison should be as unpleasant as humanly possible let's take a look at some of these torture techniques used at Club gitmo we've got slight sleep deprivation repeatedly playing children's songs people out there do you honestly believe that America is losing its moral High ground and consider this torture killing two birds with one stone in his embarrassing portrayal of not just Muslims but also  trans people it has critically acclaimed video transler of Bane versus Jihadi bod which are two different franchises I mean that one doesn't even make sense [Music] Steven loves to make the exact same joke about trans people every single year on trans day of visibility confusingly blamed trans rights activists for there being a higher rate of trans besides is anyone surprised when it's a 42 attempted side rate you don't have that anywhere else in demographic that would suggest some kind of mental proclivity  toward extreme behavior and I don't think it's helping people to Simply enable it I don't want nearly half of all transgenders to attempt suicide I want that to be lower guess what doesn't work you saying you're all good you're a woman it doesn't help it makes it worse had this to say about victims wouldn't it stand to reason that the victims of rape would usually not always generally be those who are most desirable sexually considering the crime maybe like the fives to tens I mean like you don't carjack a 98  Oldsmobile no I've searched and I could be wrong about this there are many right how many times I've been to a change in my mind it's always a blue haired would be lesbian feminists who claim they're right as far as I know not one Victoria's Secret model has been and at the beginning of his career did a really fun and tasteful bit he liked to call cultural appropriation week where for about five days straight he had not gave Jared began their show dressed in whatever caricature of a costume they  had lying around that day this week the mystical age-old culture of China [Music] oh I like the glasses with that combination like it it's kind of like The Other Woman put them back on oh oh okay um now I understand Steven's fans may be quick to write these things off is nothing more than edgy jokes and that his critics are just being snowflakes for getting mad at such top tier comedy but it's hard to make the argument that these are just mere jokes when they still accurately reflect the real belief Stephen appears to hold for  example Stephen has stated that he's a traditionalist who doesn't believe in the concept of gay marriage myself personally I Am pro traditional marriage I agree with the president on this you can't then turn around and make such unfunny jokes at the expense of gay people and expect viewers to suck it up and buy your socialism is for figs shirt gayness is still funny it's absurd so it's funny it would be the same thing if a duck walked in right now wearing pajamas we'd be like oh my God oh my God there's a  duck on us what are you doing at CPAC duck in pajamas I would have never imagined that it's the same thing when there's a dude like hello you look delicious there's just no way to genuinely write this stuff off as innocent jokes when it's Rudder than something that you genuinely Believe by 2019 Stephen had really taken off in popularity thanks to a little series he likes to call change my mind which is ironically something Stephen never actually does even if you've never watched an episode of this thing you've  probably seen the memes the premise is that Steven travels around to various locations mostly college campuses it sets up a booth to debate random people on whatever issue he's feeling that day maybe it's fascism gender immigration black lives matter is a terrorist organization you know non-incendiary topics like those for the most part he uses pretty eye-catching and intentionally offensive language to trigger a more passionate response from the people there why well it's exciting to watch people scream at each other I  guess plus it's always helpful to make the opposing side look as unreasonable and shrill as possible Stephen is banking on the fact that most of these kids are liberal so having a substantive conversation with someone who disagrees with him shouldn't be a hard thing to do but the problem with these debates is that the scales are already tipped so much in Steven's favor that it's really not much of an evenly matched exchange of ideas you start taking hormone therapy it changes the way your muscles  grow and you're not actually given that much of an advantage or you're not they don't have as much of an advantage as you think they might you know are you sure about that well I guess I'm not sure but I also not sure about anything you know this is his show after all so of course Steven picks the topic the setting the circumstances who gets the microphone and when what makes the final edit and what doesn't plus he's already given himself ample time beforehand to prepare his talking points as much as he  needs whereas the kitties debating left their dorms that morning not expecting to debate their beliefs on things like abortion they haven't made a career off politics like Steven has making them easy targets for him to rain down upon with facts and logic even when those facts aren't actually facts for example take his video America is not racist change my mind Stephen at one point claims that the US has a higher class Mobility compared to the rest of the world first off we have more class Mobility here in the United States than  anywhere else meaning there are more people in the United States who end up in the top 30 percent of income than anywhere else in the world at some point their life are in the top 10 percent including people go from the top 10 from the bottom 10 or the bottom 30 the top 30 top there's more class Mobility here in the United States more ability to rise out of poverty into upper middle class than anywhere else in the world it's not even close only I don't know what Stephen is going by sure he links to an image of a random study  on screen but even this doesn't show the US compared to the rest of the world according to the world economic Forum America ranks 27th beneath all these other countries not what I would call a hide personally and another one on abortion that Stephen finds himself perpetuating the notion that the majority of late-term abortions are not a result of medical complications but rather because the woman just feels like doing it you know women who do have late-term abortions they're not out here walking around at eight months pregnant  saying ah you know what I don't feel like having this baby anymore let's just get rid of it sure they are no they're not that's almost all light-term abortions they are medically induced and necessary no not a majority well whatever one as a matter of fact nearly never but I'm not sure where Steven got this either considering just how exceedingly rare abortions in the third trimester even are making up for only one percent of all abortions across the U.S this means the data on why women would need to get  an abortion later into the pregnancy is extremely limited so the term weight term abortion is not a medical term and it often really complicates this discussion because people kind of take it to mean something like a third trimester abortion or abortion just before or during birth which are not really things that happen and I think that it kind of really distracts from the conversation when people use that terminology for reference only about one and a half percent of U.S abortions happen after 20 weeks and this is  usually what people are referencing when they say quote late term the percent of those that are due to life threat or lethal fetal anomalies is really hard to track because they aren't always reported and when they are reported they aren't always reported with a reason but a vast majority of them will be because of a lethal fetal anomaly or a serious complication and risk to the person who's pregnant I would venture to say that all abortions that happen between 20 and 24 weeks fall into three categories most will fall into those two  groups of a life risk or lethal fetal anomaly and the remainder are people who wanted to have an abortion earlier but didn't have access so the irony here is that people who talk about this Crowder absolutely included are almost always against easier access in the first trimester which directly increases how many people seek termination later on in pregnancy I have had more patients than I can count who have experienced not only the trauma of having to end a pregnancy that they wanted but then having to go on and be repeatedly  traumatized mentally by family and friends having these conversations in such black and white non-compassionate manners we cannot forget the fact that this number is probably going to go up because we have taken away access that was previously difficult and now is impossible for probably 50 percent of people in the US so the only outcome of that is going to be that more abortions happen later in pregnancy because people have to spend time and money figuring out how to get access when they can't get access where  they live or in the state that they're in the issues that Stephen tries to condense into just a few short words are far far more nuanced than he'd have you believe and he doesn't this kind of thing constantly like here when he insists America's Health Care system is the best in the world simply because hospitals in Canada and Europe have a higher mortality rate which apparently means they have worse care don't just look at the one portion of the equation how much are you spending what are you getting for that what is the rest of the  world getting from privately funded Health Care the reason why less Americans are dying in a hospital if true wouldn't have to do with hospitals in America being better quality it actually just means more Americans are dying at home because they can't afford to die in a hospital which you might recognize as literally the opposite of his point but Stephen will stop at nothing to make sure he comes out looking smarter than the other person in the heat of debates even if he needs to Pivot to another talking point if you  watch enough of these you'll sometimes hear Steven say things to the effect of hold that thought or let's put a pin in that when his opponent says something that actually makes sense only Stephen never comes back around to those points what's your position on the minimum wage age hold on a second uh is this your this is your changing my mind I want to make sure yes I want to get started okay my position the minimum wage yeah you know what uh I'm not a fan are you against the legal immigration and legal  immigration from poor third world countries of course I'm against illegal immigration well I'm trying to convince you that your own objectives if you're a conservative cannot be achieved under capitalism okay and so I'll give you an example of that yeah um you have a lot of Republicans like Paul Ryan you cannot deny that he is a big capitalist and he has lots of capitalist donors that would like nothing more than to increase their profits I think you can agree with that and people like that have been opposing  immigration reform for decades because they believe that mass immigration will lower the wages of the working class and increase their profits okay so I would agree with you on that so if you impose a minimum wage you're not going to have this Mass immigration coming in because the companies that are taking these illegal immigrants and taking these low-wage immigrants if they had to pay them 15 an hour we wouldn't have mass immigration like we're having right now yeah I don't necessarily know that I  agree with that premise so let me kind of go um because first off before I would like to take that hold it what example we point to before we go on because I know a lot of times we disagree of a successful socialist country they just get forgotten as the conversation Trails elsewhere Steven also loves to move the goal posts when he senses his opponent making an argument he isn't able to disprove the idea that there have been different genders outside of man woman for centuries okay house yeah uh India yeah  in India you know they have their gender Native American cultures they have their genders in ancient Egypt they had their genders okay so you do realize um and you talk about how very different it was from Western culture so antithetical to Western culture you named India ancient Egypt you know what else uh we also believe in it's anathetical of those cultures we're against slavery he tried to claim the idea of two genders was a new one when the individual in classes corrected him with historical examples that proved him  wrong he immediately pivots Stephen is relying on the people he's debating to not be prepared so it's easier to twist the conversation wherever it however he wants and if things get too hot he can always just pass the mic to someone more naive Define because it's a very specific definition you came in and just said chill and really quickly to give him get ready to give the microphone to someone else if you don't stop doing this because this isn't the goal of this what's a shill well I think you're	Center			Center	198

P208	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d59kfp7CNCk	If I could just, for the record, say I would not take Congresswoman Porter's investment opportunity because it's investing with other people's money, and it's making choices that they might not themselves want to make with those dollars. I want to start by talking about other people's money, because last time I checked, that's all we spend is the American people's money. That's actually the function of Congress. And there are no dollars that we spend that do not come from the American people. So the argument that we shouldn't do something because it's spending  other people's money, would simply suggest that we don't spend any money at all, including zeroing out the defense budget. Is that, in fact, what you were suggesting, Doctor Burke, that we zero out the defense budget so that we don't spend other people's money? No, but it is the case that I just want to. I'm reclaiming my time. You are spending other people's money always, and that those choices need to reflect what most Americans want. - Okay, most Americans do. - Reclaiming my time, Mr. Chair.  Reclaiming my time. This is not a hearing about federally mandated head start. I don't know what you're talking about. This is actually not what this hearing is about. This is a hearing about the economic and individual investments and returns and benefits both to the future generation of American children as well as to our ongoing current economy. So I have an investment opportunity for everyone in the hearing room today. For every dollar that you invest, you will get back at least $4. Anyone want to invest?  - I'll take it. - It's pretty good. You won't lose your money. You'll always get back more than you put in. And unlike some of these investment schemes, mine is legal. Anyone in? This is, just math. Four is more than one. More money is better than less money. Economists agree. Republicans. Democrats agree this investment is not a hard decision. People would snap this up in the real world. Invest a dollar, get four back. No risk. Miss Patek, would you believe me if I told you that Congress had that same  investment opportunity for our country and turned it down every year? - Sadly, yes. - Why would you believe that? Because we know that the science is there. That when we support children and families, especially starting at birth, that it yields long terme and outsized benefits for families and for our economy? And yet, here we are, over 50 years after Nixon vetoed universal child care. Still, with families struggling to find and afford care and providers making poverty wages. And I think you gave earlier, what is the total new estimate of how much this would  generate for our if we had affordable childcare, full access to child care, what would this generate for our economy? So for a family, for the whole economy, for the whole economy. Okay. So we're losing right now $122 billion. $122 billion that we could have in our economy. And yet what we hear around here all the time is that we don't have money to do things. So Congress has had years to invest in universal child care. Every dollar we put in would have generated estimates show about $4 for our  economy, and yet we still don't have it. Why? Miss Potato. Why don't we have this? Well, we need to build the political and public will. The voters are there. - Okay. - So let's. The problem must be then the will of the people here. Because voters support this. So let's talk about who's here. How would you describe the gender balance and average age of Congress? - It skews older male and whiter. - That's correct. So about only about 28% of members of Congress are women. The median age in the Senate is 65, and the median age in the House is 58.  So lots on average, lots of older people, lots of older men, lots of men. Is this the type of group who personally needs early childhood education? - Generally. - Not generally. Not so. Early childhood education won't benefit many members. Most the average member of Congress. Most members kids are grown so they don't have to care about where their kids are going. And even when their kids were young, most members leaned heavily on their wives. And I say wives because most members are men, heterosexual men,  to juggle their kids schedule. And frankly, there's a lot of rich people in Congress who didn't have to worry about how to afford childcare or how to navigate the system because they were wealthy. Too many in Congress don't get it because they never had to live it. So this leads to the familiar policy pattern. The older men collectively, that's our Congress not to take away from any individual champions, including Representative Beyer and Senator Heinrich, but the collective body of older, richer men in Congress overinvest in things they  understand, like the Pentagon, and they under-invest in things like early childhood education that don't personally benefit them, maybe don't even make sense to them, and maybe do not reflect how they lived their lives, even if they are big problems for the majority of Americans. So, Miss Batiuk, when institutions like Congress perpetuate long standing social disparities for women like this, is there a terme for that? - I think it's called patriarchy. - Patriarchy is correct. I would also call it structural sexism.  When we say smash the patriarchy, when we say that structural sexism continues to permeate this body and this policy, our policies, that's what we're talking about. We're not imagining it. It's not about interpersonal slights. It is about what this body chooses to get done and to fund and to focus on, and what always ends up on the cutting room floor and legislation. Sexual, structural sexism is an age old story. It's not going to go away by itself. It's going to go away because we make it go away.  When we stop undervaluing the work of black and brown women who or the majority of child care workers, we start recognizing that women can and must contribute to our economy if we're going to have a globally competitive economy. So, Miss Boutique, to fix this problem, Congress has to abandon these sexist, outdated ideas and start thinking more about investments. How much would Congress need to invest to establish universal early childhood education? We have been advocating for $700 billion over ten years to invest  in high quality early care and education, which could easily be supported by taxing wealthy individuals and corporations. So you're advocating for 700 billion over ten years, president Biden, remember, everyone proposed 400 billion for preschool and child care. And yet that would have multiplied by four generated trillions of dollars for our economy. So all of our witnesses, everybody said that we take this bet we'd quadruple our money if we could. So investing in early childhood education shouldn't be a hard call.  Even given the profile of Congress, we should all want to make investments that pay back. So if my colleagues are not moved by the clear economic benefit of investing in early childhood education, maybe they'll be moved simply by this single mom asking them to care on behalf of all the other parents of young children who are struggling in this country, I implore Congress to invest in child care, child care workers, and early childhood education. There are lots of ways that we could deliver this.  Like Representative Beyer, I have had lots of different kinds of arrangements. Universal, to quote what most mosaic said, doesn't mean the same. Universal means that the funding, the outcome, the choice is there and available. If if we had universal health care in this country and we don't, some people might choose to go get a colonoscopy every year and a lot of people won't. It's the same thing with child care. I personally have had my children in big corporate care. I have had them hourly in home part time.  I have had full time living, I have been in a family owned small business and I have had in-home family based care, all of it. And you know what? It all was really helpful. Particularly as a single mother. Because there is no other person. Senator Vance's hypothetical says that one parent might prefer to stay home. That's probably true. There's a lot of statistics that show that parents, men and women have different preferences at different points in time. But what about the 10 million single moms? Where do they fit?  Doctor Burke, where did you put your children in child care? Well, I'm not going to bring my children into this hearing, so doesn't have any bearing on this. - Do you have children? - I do. So I'm sharing my story because my story is one that doesn't get heard in this Congress. Because, you know how many single moms there are. 1 or 2. One. Child care, custodial care to help people who may choose all kinds of different options. I've had full time care. I've had three fourths care. I had a state when I had a spouse. He stayed home some years.  That was how we fit the pieces together. But that's what this hearing is about. Not jamming one size fits all. But if there isn't the money, there won't be the choice. That's why we see married parents choose saying they would prefer to stay home because they have the option to stay home. Single parents don't say they'd rather stay home because they couldn't. So our whole perspective here is warped by the fact that this body is so disproportionately unrepresentative of the American people's experience.  It is absolutely Congress's job to spend the American people's money. And if we can't spend it to help the next generation of American workers, I don't know what the hell we're doing here, I yield back. Can I respond quickly to that? - No, she actually cannot. - No. Thank you, doctor. All right. We appreciate it, but. 	Liberal			Liberal	201

SAM GANNON, FOX FOUR SPORTS, SAM, THANKS. AS THE US SUPREME COURT WEIGHS WHETHER CITIES CAN BAN THE HOMELESS FROM SLEEPING OUTSIDE TODAY, DALLAS COUNCIL MEMBERS HEARD ABOUT PLANS TO TRY TO INCREASE HOUSING FOR THE HOMELESS. FOX FOUR'S LAURIE BROWN LIVE IN DALLAS WITH THAT, LAURIE. OF COURSE, THE CASE THAT WENT BEFORE THE U.S. SUPREME COURT MONDAY IS CONSIDERED ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT CASES ON  HOMELESSNESS IN DECADES. SOME COURTS FOUND THAT IT IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL TO FIND AND ARREST HOMELESS PEOPLE IN ENCAMPMENTS. IF THERE IS NO SPACE AVAILABLE IN SHELTERS FOR THE HOMELESS ARE UNDER ATTACK, WHAT DO WE DO? STAND UP. FIGHT BACK. HUNDREDS OF ADVOCATES FOR THE HOMELESS GATHERED OUTSIDE DEMOCRACY TO DALLAS, LIKE MANY CITIES, HAS STRUGGLED TO DEAL WITH HOMELESS ENCAMPMENTS. OFFICIALS CLEAN UP ONE SITE, ONLY TO HAVE ANOTHER SITE POP UP DOWN THE STREET. IN GRANTS PASS, OREGON, THE CITY BEGAN ISSUING  $295 FINES FOR SLEEPING OUTSIDE AS TENTS SPRUNG UP IN THE CITY'S PUBLIC PARKS. THE U.S. SUPREME THE POLICY AMOUNTS TO CRUEL AND UNUSUAL PUNISHMENT. JUSTICE SONIA SOTOMAYOR ASKED, WHERE DO WE PUT THEM? IF EVERY CITY, EVERY VILLAGE, EVERY TOWN LACKS COMPASSION AND PASSES A LAW IDENTICAL TO THIS, WHERE ARE THEY SUPPOSED TO SLEEP? ARE THEY SUPPOSED TO KILL THEMSELVES, NOT SLEEPING? JUSTICE BRETT KAVANAUGH QUESTIONED IF TICKETING PEOPLE FOR CAMPING WOULD HELP THE PROBLEM. IF THERE ARE NO SHELTER BEDS. BUT HE ALSO  RAISED CONCERNS ABOUT FEDERAL COURTS MICROMANAGING POLICY. THESE ISSUES ILLUSTRATE THE PROBLEM IN MANY STATES ACROSS PARTY LINES OF MANAGING ENCAMPMENTS. IN DALLAS TUESDAY, THE FOCUS TURNED TO CREATING MORE HOUSING THROUGH A PROGRAM CALLED ALL INSIDE OUR ULTIMATE GOAL IS TO ENSURE WHAT WE DO HERE. WE'RE CREATING A DEVELOPER FRIENDLY ENVIRONMENT. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE AMELIORATE ALL BARRIERS TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING. CITY COUNCILMAN KAREN MENDELSSOHN ENCOURAGED THE FEDERAL PARTNERSHIP TO FOCUS ON  MORE SINGLE FAMILY HOUSING FOR THE HOMELESS. MY DISTRICT 65% MULTIFAMILY, AND I DON'T THINK IT'S HEALTHY TO HAVE THAT HIGH OF A LEVEL. IT'S ALSO THE NUMBER ONE LOCATION OF CRIME IN OUR CITY. IS MULTIFAMILY HOUSING. COUNCILMAN CHAD WEST WAS CONCERNED ABOUT A LACK OF SPECIFIC SIX, WHICH IS SIGNIFICANT WHEN CONSIDERING BUILDING AND PROPERTY COSTS. WHEN CAN WE GET THAT FROM YOU? THAT SAYS, YOU KNOW, WE NEED 20,000 MORE UNITS OF X, WE NEED 10,000 MORE SINGLE FAMILY HOMES IN THE CITY. AT THIS PRICE POINT. WHEN CAN WE EXPECT TO GET  THAT FROM STAFF? IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN THAT KIND OF DATA BECAUSE OUR MARKET CONSTANTLY CHANGES. BUT IF WE'RE NOT WORKING TOWARDS A SET OF DATA THAT WE'VE ADOPTED AS A CITY, WE'RE JUST SPINNING OUR WHEELS. HOMELESSNESS IS AT A RECORD HIGH IN THE UNITED STATES AT 650,000 PEOPLE. THE SUPREME COURT IS EXPECTED TO DECIDE THE ENCAMPMENT CASE BY THE END OF JUNE.

hiding behind a chair in that room alone naked next to this knife is that normal or does that concern you whatsoever absolutely not because I left  him in the hands of my AG girls okay which I thought was legal I thought I was able to do that listen if if your girls are capable of looking after him that's fine but you were unconscious with vomit all over you in the driver seat of a car so I'm just trying to figure out how long has it been since you checked on your kids how um an hour or so what happened between when you checked on them and you ended up in the car passed out like that an hour or

you  need to just own up to it where's my kids going to go we have to call DCF they're going to have to put in some kind of parenting plan for now Chelsea in fact did the exact opposite of getting clean and was rearrested in February 2024 for coaxing her 73-year-old boyfriend to drive back to her home for sex while her newest boyfriend Andrew Marx awaited them only to beat the old man with a metal object and Rob him of his wallet glasses and wristwatch she is currently housed at the vucha county jail a nine counts  including aggravated battery on a person 65 years or older robbery with a weapon possession of synthetic cannabis with intent to sell possession of Controlled Substances including oxycodone and amphetamines among other charges following this video's events robbert and Chelsea were both booked into jail and Chelsea was charged with one count of felony child neglect while Robert was charged with culpable negligence of a child Chelsea posted bonds 6 days later in the amount of 2500 Robert was able to post bond after only  one day in the same amount they both eventually pled no contest to the charges Chelsea was sentenced to 36 months of probation with special conditions including mandatory drug testing grief counseling a department of children in family's parenting class and was even eligible for an early release after 24 months if she hadn't robbed and beaten her new elderly boyfriend Robert received a similar probationary sentence and was recently released from it because he did not Rob and beat up an old man like Chelsea did do you think  the

P295	https://youtu.be/eThIFhZiToI?si=OJiqfxlb9G1TrQqc	it is episode 14 14 episodes when you do the math 14 episodes four episodes a month 4 8 12 I mean we are really doing a good job here of keeping it regular it is let's chat with cat and Pat my name is Patrick Gilroy alongside Katrina B episode number 14 our second consecutive episode off schedule Off plan Katrina you just said uh off mic that you don't like recording off schedule neither do I but let me ask you a question based on the fact that we are both dedicated employees that travel as part of our  jobs uh parents and everything else that we've got going on in our lives how the are we supposed to keep this thing to the regular Monday night recording Tuesday during the day publishing schedule that we have come to know and love we can't right now during our season I'm in back to school season already you're in trade SE no no it's funny because this these are our jobs right so you're in back to school and how bananas does that sound back to school all these kids are looking forward to they're coming off of April  break looking forward to summer vacation you are already in your back to school season it is what um it'll be May 2024 by the time this thing publishes I have already sold Christmas 2025 I'm sorry Christmas 2024 Valentine's and Easter 2025 and I'm now on the road selling summer 2025 I'll be selling Halloween 25 by the end of August so our schedules for our real jobs like the timeline that we work on are not in the present it's so and it takes so long to get used to it and it has ruined Christmas for me  forever because Christmas is the season that will not end so instead of you know November 1st rolling around and you start to see the early adopters with the early trees the early lights the malls get all lit up instead of that excitement building for the holiday season that you you're almost ingrained into believing in and and it's been a part of your life forever it's ruined for me because what has happened is I sold that Christmas a year prior I got the POS uh I don't know April of that year they're supposed to ship in June  and July of that year inevitably they're late every single year because they're supposed to be received in August and September so at this point I'm getting emails and phone calls from all these angry buyers and once the stuff actually hits the stores I am nervously awaiting sales reports every day are we going to hit our sell through minimums how are the items doing and then on December 26th from all the majors I get an email all the charge back all the money that you owe for selling them Christmas and  then the next week you're back on the road selling them Christmas for the next year so this podcast truly is a labor of love it really well I it's it's what keeps us sane because I am so happy to be away from my 20-year career in retail so that that isn't the life that I have to live but I still have to plan a quarter or two ahead of where I'm actually at in my education job um which is equally as frustrating and then you're supposed to like staff for back to school but yet you have such tough labor controls and it and it's the  constant of like it's like 6 weeks of nothing you hear is it's all moaning complaining constantly and managing a report like you have to sell this Munch you have to do this much I have to hire this much we have to have these many people on but you can't spend that much labor or you don't have any sales going through because Christmas that can't if it gets delivered in September it can't hit the floor until after Halloween and then if they sell through Halloween then it can hit the floor but like them selling through  Halloween isn't necessarily a big win for you in selling can so it's this constant whole thing where we're very much looking forward to when all the kids are old enough when it's the holiday season we're just going to go be those people who like hop on a cruise and like Island hop the week between Christmas and New Year like that is going to be us I want to make this very very clear from the time that I was born until the time that I die I will always believe that Jesus Christ was the son of God that he was nailed up on on a cross  that he resurrected and that he is our Lord and savior I am going to act like the biggest baddest Jew when the kids are done growing up we are going to go when it's Christmas time sure we're buying ourselves a trip like I when when I say a Jew I don't mean I'm going to be cheap I mean it doesn't make a difference cheap enough for us if it's December 24th December 25th like I I know I should be in church and celebrating with family and doing the seven fishu and all this that like you see on TV and that we used to do as  children the reality is addiction old age alcoholism and real life have ruined what once was large families like growing up I know you had a relatively large family growing up I had a large family we had an annual Gilroy party in my backyard where there were hundreds of Gilroy I think I I talked to four Gilroy right now and none of them are immediate family one is a stranger that found me when I was doing my late night on on EI and was like oh we have the same last name we're related yeah like like I don't talk to  anybody anymore so I have no problem going on a cruise during Christmas time and you know I'll hit the chapel I I'll make the sign of the cross and then we'll move on what we can do it's like we can just appreciate like we've we've worked hard all year we enjoy spending time together it's about appreciating and reflecting on like your year what you have grabed gratitude for and I'm happy to do that on a pool deck on a cruise through like the Mediterranean and the reality is unless something drastic changes with the kids and when I  say changes I mean all three of them suddenly get this sudden need to show some gratitude for the things that we give them or one of them or two of them have children in a normal fashion uh not something that you know happened at 16 years old it hasn't happened yet but not something knock was exactly but you know if in five eight years the oldest are married or are engaged or in a committed relationship and they and they want to plan a holiday with us by all means but right now we are not the priority  holiday parents no and neither we're not we're the ones with the good gifts but we're not the priority we're on a cruise and we are unreachable via phone those grandkids will still get spectacular gifts oh yeah and if those grandkids are brought about in a relatively normal-ish way we will be there to support them and be there for them but we are not going to be the parents that sacrifice another 20 years to raise a kid that was born because one of these kids up at 16 years old the exes they can handle  that we have handled all the heavy lifting for the entirety of Our Lives between our up families and our up marriages and the up kids so at this point I think we've earned the right tapped out to say you know what it's somebody else's turn H brings it back to that word boundaries these are our boundaries yeah it's funny when we started the show we do have a topic and we're going to get to it I said I've got something I want to get to real quick this was not it I just want to run something by you I know we've  talked about it a little bit but it's getting to the point now where I made your Lexus appointment today so when you're on your trip um you can take my car to the airport I'll take your car but you've got the appointment and that's going to be the last time because I'm going to start doing the oil changes once the sun is real okay and I got your email about your Marriott booking and I will attach it so that you get the proper Reward Points tomorrow I appreciate that honey I do we're see that we're on the same page here where  one favor is given to one it is returned in another way uh we just do what we're good at we're leaning into our strengths but like this is my big annual trade show so the reason why next week's show will be off schedule a little bit is because we normally record on Mondays Mondays are a long day 100% of the time we've got the youngest here and the youngest is 13 Going on 14 so he goes to school all day we're at work I get home from work at quter 6 he and I need to be in the car by six to get into  Civil Air Patrol anyone who's been listening to our podcast knows Monday night is a civil air that's how we Rec long night and that's when we record right but this coming week you're going to be gone you're going be I'll be in Orlando during our recording time you're going to be gone for a ridiculous amount of time and it's it's stupid but God bless you uh I swear the amount of work that they've got ready for you you guys could do in 2 and a half days but instead you're going to be gone all week  that's fine and today you had a prec Cascade so so the meeting is called a Cascade meeting today you had to spend four hours on a pre Cascade virtual Cascade before the Cascade meeting for five days it's amazing what big corporate companies uh do to to sort of waste time we're meeting for the meeting for the participation preparing for the meeting to to be prepared for the meeting to make sure that you are best prepared for your meeting and now mind you I am p I have all my appropriate outfits that I  need and I basically need three outfits a day one to work out one to go to the meeting one for the evening events I did do all my prep work so did you pack your Gala event I did what' you pack my Christmas dress that I wore to your holiday event oh off I thought you said s you so you're going to wear a booby dress no well no cuz it's up to my neck so the leather dress yes but it doesn't show you're wearing a leather dress well cuz the other option was going to cleavage no it was going to be the pants suit I know but you can see  that I got some serious boobs and I just thought that was inappropriate I think it's inappropriate for a company to hold a Gala I'm sorry like I I I find it wildly inappropriate for them to make you stay for an extra 24 hours for a gala where they at the beginning of the preparation for this said family and friends welcome kids welcome and then we find out about the gala and the next thing you know we hear that you're going to get multiple Awards ws and I'm excited because you're it's an excuse  for you to get doled up for me to get doled up and I can be there to support you the woman that I love and we live hold on no no no I want to be there to to to stand up and cheer as you win these Awards and instead what happens like the Casual disinvite happens well not only that you have a work trip and let let's just talk about the Christmas parties CU we had two Christmas parties to go to this year how much time did I actually spend getting doled up I worked a full day and then spent 30 minutes  right and you were the prettiest girl there wasn't even doing that like that I'm doing the same routine I am not here for the pr Le dress do not need to go to dry yes it was a leather dress that's Calin Klein so it's a good brand you look great at it but I got it on clearance for $25 what what are the odds that either a married Andor single actually I can't even do that what are the odds that a human being hits on you in your leather dress you're going to smell unlikely because it I don't want to hear that it's against company  are you serious right now do you know how naive you sound you worked for Victoria's Secret for 11 years that was a little different I mean who was running Victoria Secret at that time how many that's a whole different stul how many things against company policy took place it's a family focused business it is not an issue I'm sorry Family Focus you're going to be at a trade show that's way worse than going to an educational conference I'm going to be a trade show for 48 hours with sales people my co-workers will all be there  for 5 days like you okay but you're with other salespeople I have been to these trade shows yours is way worse than mine I am perpetually exhausted A and B there's only one well there's one guarantee I think I mean depending on the poor zingus injury because I can't guarantee it anymore oh so you're going to go drink and go to a freaking game in a box yeah what's Jake you know what the the optional night that I have the optional event if the Celtics are playing the orando of magic I'm finding people and  we're going so go I want you to go I want you to go and be the like the hot like sexy Celtics girl there did you pack a your your I Pritchard is going with me so pritchard's going Horford's not going Ty is not going like it's just isn't on the cmore I know he's not but he he he stands for principle like I feel like Daniel Ty kind of helps Define you like you are the well that is hardworking but that isn't that like pton Pritchard he goes out there he gives 100% like he's the best player every freaking night yep  so we started this podcast saying it was going to go 40

never celebrate your birthday on your birthday we try to make a weekend of it the weekend before or the weekend after and actually it's both weekends because one of those weekends is a kid weekend so

Security and my identity of keeping my maiden name has always worked out best so I I say like roll with what's worth best so what did you say though about uh I have no problem on social media or invitations like a Sur name when it comes to the podcast is the description going to be am I going to continue to say it's Patrick Gilroy along Katrina ptii or am I going to say it's Patrick Gilroy alongside Katrina Gilroy well we like whatever you choose  honey whatever I choose let's see how good you are between now and January of 2025 when we get married by the way our rings are in we got the the the phone call today we can go pick them up at barakan uh big thank you goes out to bakian Jewelers they had their annual wedding ring Sales Event in March so we went we took advantage of that they 20% off saved us a bunch of money I got I wanted to buy my ring on Teemu for $2.98 and I said hell no so we wound up spending a lot more than that on mine much more than I ever thought I would  spend on me but I think it's a good investment because if this relationship doesn't work out we're all it it's we're so financially like we have all these plans where we're almost over the hump that hump is going to get much larger if this doesn't work out um but one thing I wanted to get to is this for the last three weeks I have been doing my hair instead of wearing a hat when I go to work yeah I need to buy new hairspray for you I have an Ulta coupon I'll get why do I need a new hairspray because you've used all the hairspray in  the house well I need to it's not quite long and thick enough yet for it to like are you going to need a travel hairspray now too yes I am because so when I go to Ulta this weekend with my birthday coupons I'll make sure to get big sexy hair straight for so what it's got to be the little can though for for Trel I can get a little can and I can get get a big can stock our bathroom since we're out of hairspray so we've got a marketing team at our job right and most of them are girls and and they're not like they  hate me because I'm a pain in the ass um one of them said to me today Patrick you're a walking billboard for a hair transplant and yeah you are so I like that like it means that because today coincidentally is the femon anniversary of it being done so I also got a text today from pariso who is my Advocate at asvita in Turkey so are you going to do like another like the the after look of what this looks like from the prolook for the video so she yes so she sent me a text today because once a month on the  anniversary she wants to see a picture yeah so I sent her a picture it was the first time that my hair was like done usually I just take my hat off and I show her and she was blown away so she sent a picture back of the day of my surgery and because we're together every day I think it looks as drastic to you as it does when you compare and contrast the two and then she sent the best message she said understand Patrick you're at month five you still have seven months to go for that to get thicker and longer that full and  Luscious and your whole sales pitch mind you ladies and gentlemen he takes more time to do his hair he uses more hair products than I use I do it's not easy being me but regardless at least now I've got the I've got something to work with here okay so I'm excited about it but this show my point is you're coming back from your show I am going to mine 72 hours later I've been in the industry for 12 years now I've been at the show for 12 years straight I see a lot of these people one time a year 99% of the  time they've seen me wearing a button-down shirt sometimes a jacket and a scall cap because I don't like to show my hair off they're not going to recognize you do I get my hair colored I want to get my hair colored I don't want to go jet black but I want to find a place that will do the proper salt and pepper look for my beard and my hair because I've come this far so why not just why don't we just do Just For Men and I do it for you because the one time I've done Just For Men I stained my face  yeah but that was you doing it I had to take an SOS pad to my face okay you also couldn't clean up a freaking broken glass this morning so you don't want me to spend the money to get my hair done prop asked for a few options for you to get your hair dyed and people are nervous with doing it because you're fresh off the hair transplant that's the reason that's the reason so why don't I just not tell somebody that it's like why can't I just make an appointment somewhere Why can't your guy doesn't  your guy do hair dying no really no they don't believe in it they do the topic stuff so they'll put fibers in my hair to make it look fuller and look darker but those only last 48 hours they don't dye hair there so yes they charge good money it's cash only they do a great job they make a sexy haircut they don't die there so I went looking in the last couple of days for places local to us and I'm struggling to find a place outside of Great Clips and Fantastic Sams you can't do that I don't want to  I'd rather I'd rather do it I'd rather you do it but then I wanted to ask you your father is how old how how old is Grandpa Dave Grandpa how old am I so oh my God this is not that hard of a question Jesus Christ he's the same age as my mother that was very easy answer he's 64 he doesn't have a single gray on that head of hair of his yes but it's that like faded look but where does he go because when he gets it done it looks awesome that dude comes Rolling In Like a Pimp the day that he gets his hair done he goes in  Hudson her name is Angela I used to sell her stuff I can figure it out for you if you'd like but I don't want what I don't want it's AA I don't want the shocking look that your dad gets I want something where it's more subtle I want more pepper than Salt but I don't want it to be completely you know what I mean I don't want that you're you're you're asking to pay for a lot of money to get your hair dyed and when I have my hair appointment while you're gone on the 15th it'll be cheaper than yours I know  okay anyway so we've got one thing to talk about here today one thing only and it's not about my hair it's not complaining about trips it has nothing to do with that does it have to do with you stealing my face moisturizer no we've already been I didn't steal your face moisturizer recently oh is the razor did you not like the new razor what are you talking about in the bathroom what are you talking about like are you still using the razar the Venus I'm not using your Venus okay do you see I've got my my  Mach 3 in the B what are you talking about I my balls I needed a fresh gut today because the the sun is leaving tomorrow and I'm hoping your period leaves tomorrow and I hadn't done a fresh cut in a few days but I didn't want to do one tomorrow with one more day of growth so this morning I took care of it so tomorrow it's much easier on me I was bleeding today just to make myself Katrina ready knowing we've only got a limited amount of time between when he leaves and then when you leave and then when I leave and we need  to get back to being regular in that department real soon you you said back to being regular like so many times I feel like I need to get you metam musel I don't have poop I don't have poop on the mind I've got sex on the mind but this is yeah what a turn on but I we just got back we we talked about it last week do you want me to pause this you go refill that glass no it's I just feel like you need it right now but we just got back and from from a lowy four five day vacation with a 13-year-old but and we love him to death  we're super proud of him he gets great grades Civil Air Patrol he he's come a country mile but you know sometimes in in this world that we all live in a country mile what's a country mile I he's come a long way like I'm super proud of the kid so I'm I'm I'm being cautious with how I I parse my words here you know he's not the most social kid in the world and every kid at 13 14 years old is looking for their people looking for an identity and in talking to him maybe this new world is very different from the world that we grew up  in but he swears to God up and down that because he plays football he plays basketball he is a much better football player than he is a basketball player but he's also in chorus he was in drama he's on the track team so you would think that he's got his group but he doesn't and he says Dad we don't have groups the way that you did and we've had this long drawn out conversation a few times they don't Define kids in their lunchroom by the jocks don't sit together The Artsy kids don't sit together they don't identify that way  anymore everybody can get lost behind like a phone or a tablet or like I mean he's almost closer with his friends that he plays online video games with with and when you mentioned like going to do a visit to Michigan cuz easy for either one of us to get to Michigan he been playing he's been playing with this kid cat for like five years they talk every day they exchange gifts in the mail and I offered to go take him to go hang out with cat for for a long weekend and and he said no dad that'll ruin everything  that we've got and that was eye opening to me it's like this whole alternate reality of how to socialize and have a friend group but you know the the bigger picture here is that part of me is happy that if this is the reality that there's no longer the table for jocks the table for The Artsy kids the table for the Alti kids the outcasts like that's great and that everyone's inclusive that means we've come a long way as a society in the last 30 years however what I what I struggle with is for all of his intelligence and maybe  I'll post it and I'll I'll black out the the the identifying factors in it because nobody's going to believe me but what I struggle with is like the last two years we've seen his standardized test scores come back and the kid is in like the 99.6 percentile in all these major categories Uber intelligent like it's stupid he's he's smarter than we are and he knows it and he uses that the problem is the ability to communicate the street smarts the ability the ability to read to read facial like facial recognition to understand a  situation that you're in uh being socially aware all of those things I swear we're dealing with a first grader and there's no class that we can take together there's no lesson that we can all do together to get him up to speed and yes with the Advent of phones and technology and and being interconnected 20 247 that goes Way Beyond or way before covid but I swear Katrina the issue that we have now and to a certain extent it affects your your son too because it's the co effect it's the co effect like like your son is much more  socially Adept than Connor is however based on his social maturity I would never believe that he's entering his junior year of college I put him maybe a sophomore junior in high school and he's like I'm going to go hang out with my friends and what that means is going home to his room to his computer to play video games virtually with all his friends it it doesn't make any sense to me so my worry here is this Co effect where all of these kids and it happened at different ages and different stages  you know for Connor for the youngest it was fourth fifth and part of sixth grade where you're stuck at home you're stuck at home doing school virtually and yes I applaud the schools for coming up with the ability for these kids to continue to get their education with very short notice like there was no notice here they they had to adapt immediately so I'm empathetic to the struggle that the schools had however now here we are a year and a half two years fully postco where nobody's wearing masks except for  the crazy people and we don't hear about it on the news anymore the kids are developmentally and socially behind to the point where our son or Connor here is going into eighth grade he's got one year left before high school and I think socially he's the equivalent to a third grader and it's because he had two plus years of sitting in his bedroom in his pajamas not being forced to learn how to socialize grp birth parties like there's no birthday parties there's no play dates you can't go to a playground you  you can't there's no lunch table there's no sleepovers there's no foret you're talking about popular no I'm sorry there's open discussion in class to even have like a good debate on anything like you didn't have to sit through somebody reading their story or their poem that they WR that they WR that they wrote so you're talking you're talking about the popular kids and and that's fine like the sleepovers the parties and all that stuff that matters just as much I'm sorry like a good trampoline did you say  thing invite would be Fant what you you brought something up to me the other day about I don't know if you read it or you heard it but there was something about how kids no longer want to do sleepovers they no longer want to do sleepovers but the other thing is is you also don't know the other person's house are they a predator do they have a different sexual preference but but the kids want to do it do the kids the kids don't want to do it and well and the reality is is they can continue hanging out and discussing  and talking through FaceTime through Zoom through the video games you don't need to be sleeping at somebody's house at 12:30 in the morning in order to continue communicating with them but what you're losing in that and I think because you work remotely 98% of the time and I like I know I have a love hate with it I really do because we get to keep up with laundry I can like do grocery shopping or get the gym in between you want to get out too but at the same time like I don't have the same connectivity with a person that I did  face to face like I do via zoom and I feel like that contributes to why my turnover sometimes is high because I don't get to properly build a relationship with somebody of course it does and I can't properly communicate or understand somebody's feeling through a text message as a salesperson and one thing you you and I have in common when it comes to work is when Co hit and hit hard and everybody else went on fur low and got money from the government we kept working weing our companies adjusted good bad and different we can  come up with reasons why we liked it we didn't like it but for a couple of years I wasn't able to get on a plane and make that one one-onone connection with my buyers and and as somebody that sells a nice two not a half to uh that one-on-one is critically important they need to know my name meaning if I call my buyer right now and I call their cell phone if they don't answer the phone one of two ways where they say hey Patrick or give me the opportunity to say hey it's Patrick I never want to have to say  it's Patrick Gilroy from Original Gourmet if I have to fully identify myself to any one of my buyers can't sell to them I have failed as a professional they need to know who I am they need to know about you my divorce the 40 Grand that goes out the window the expenses for my kids because what happens is this when you sell a nice to not a have to it's easy to dump that item however if they like you and have a relationship with you they're not just dumping an item they're dumping you and they're dumping a lot of responsibility  and burden upon you and if they know about your previously exist burden and responsibility they're going to think twice it's human nature we can deal with that as adults because we've got the knowhow we've got the it it's built up in us so we've almost got the insurance built up in US to deal with that these kids don't have that and well they missed out on the whole like crushes asking somebody to like have an have an invite am I going to see you at the like the school dance they don't want to go to the school dances right  are you going to participate in the like ice cream socialist going on at the school they missed all that but then they also never got to learn how to get like rejection and it not necessarily being a bad thing so now if if a kid gets rejected they're anxiety strict in you need to be concerned about their mental health like how do like we can't we can't have any bad news and it's like a it's not a joke and this is the problem I don't want like Co happened in the'80s there'd be no good 80s movies  like what would have happened to the plot line well like suicide is not a joke it's it's affected you personally you know your mom and we'll have that show at some point here it's it's a very real thing um mental illness has affected both of our families my mother has been addicted to to heroin and opiates for 40 years you know alcoholism helped contribute to the death of my dad these are all coping mechanisms and there's no generation that's perfect here what I worry about so much about this current generation and I can't  pinpoint it down to today's sth eth and nth graders because I see it affecting kids that are in college too is that the two and a half three years of Developmental development that they missed is it's been crucial the accountability accountability socially so here's the thing and you and I having to power on work hard like overcome an objection they they AB they didn't have to suffer a consequence they didn't have to be held accountable to anything that like even asking Connor to do homework we've had to come up with like three  different ways and how can we figure out homework because during Co homework wasn't even a thing it was optional so so why was it optional for three years and and now you're asking me to do homework how dare you I already went to school for 7even hours what do you mean that there's more mind you we both work 60 hours a week but this is the thing about homework and you know this in elementary school they barely have it and then in Middle School you step it up a little bit so in junior high you step  it up a little more and then in high school step it up a little more and if you know anything about the curriculums and the way that they are set now they're state to state so and I know this is internationally broadcast but state to state they're kind of similar homework is built into the curriculum as a structured way of reinforcing what was taught in school that day and it it is if your the lesson plan calls for 45 minutes of learning about x y and z the lon plan also calls for something reassuring that and and making it  essential later on at home that day for 45 minutes these kids missed a step in the ladder and as human beings if you climb a ladder and you miss a couple of steps 99% of the time you're going to fall flat in your face now you get redus you get excuses to get out of it you're not set for Success when you go out into the workforce so heaven forbid we ask you to do like an attendance log for children coming into program it's wait wait wait wait wait and like these are Basics like and and they just they  lost they lost accountability skills they lost social skills they lost reading cues they lost feeling uncomfortable and having to kind of work through that so like a conflict resolution like all of that so like I I vividly remember not being ready for tests in like seventh grade and my stomach would hurt I'd feel like I have the shits and it mat but that's because it mattered to me I didn't know it mattered to me at the time I just knew that I would find myself in the bathroom because I didn't study properly these  kids don't have that anxiety well no they get to retake it three or four times until they actually pass which is also like I have such an issue with the accountability piece for that because like nobody has to learn how to earn anything anymore and then when you get into the workforce it's you know yes you're expected to be at work on time yes you're expected to work a full eight hour shift yes you're expected to have communication and get along with your peers and like these are the basics these are the minimums and we're seeing  on social media all these people complaining or I got laid off or I got this or I got that I had to actually go to an in-person interview and it wasn't virtual what a waste of my time for 45 minutes that I had to drive there and interview in person and anybody that knows anything about that knows that if you don't get the job you treat that interview as an for the next like what is the feedback what did I learn from here what did I what can I do better for the next time instead like the rejection has to go  down this social media like slide where everybody else is on it and then they're all like self diagnosing I got this I got that I BL autism Asbergers like I we hear it all and we hear it all the time I need I need time off for mental health and here's the thing which which I do feel like mental health is a real thing very real thing except for I feel like we use it as a regular way as a crutch to get out of doing what 20 years ago were were normal everyday things that people just got off DE well what's  happening now is that people that have real mental health crisises and and look we brought it up last week I'll say it again right now uh thank you to Kirk minahan uh Kirk minahan has brought us on his Network and we are so grateful for the opportunity to be a part of what you do Kirk left EI for a while uh Kirk I don't know if you know this but Kirk tried to commit suicide he he legitimately really get this person no he's he's my age he's a little bit older than I am all right he he legitimately put himself out there was  going to walk in front of a train and kill himself meanwhile he had two kids a wife and a dream job mental health is very real and it's something that we should not take for granted however because we're going to ask a child to do homework for 30 minutes shouldn't mean that they have a mental health issue we can't equate that 30 minutes to what Kirk went through and so many people what your mom went through like these are things that are very real that affect your ability to live in this world and enjoy your life and be a  productive member of society for a long time be there for your family and be your best self versus doing your social studies homework for 30 minutes but these kids now because they didn't get that 2 and 1/2 years of inperson with the social skills and they didn't feel the pit in their stomach and what I was going to say about the pit in the stomach the same pit in the stomach that I felt about not being prepared for a test was also the same pit in my stomach that I felt before I asked a girl out or	Center			Liberal	208

Ober Leutnant Ranneft represented the German Army which was present with a detachment  The graves were marked with simple white Wooden Crosses bearing the name and army unit of the deceased. The Joint Memorial by both armies is remarkable to say the least A memorial was erected at Crooswijk cemetary as can be seen here Here we see the NSKK, the Nationalsozialistische Kraftfahrkorps parading through respectively the Hague, Amsterdam and Haarlem. The NSKK was a paramilitary unit within the NSDAP, the German National Socialist laborers party The NSKK consisted of various so-called "Motor gruppen", motor corpses  that largely performed logistical and other tasks for the Wehrmacht [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] On the 29th of May 1940 the government of the Netherlands was officially transferred from the Wehrmacht to the military commander of Belgium and the Netherlands General Alexander von Falkenhausen to the Austrian-born Arthur Seys Inquart Originally he was a lawyer and a Nazi politician Here we witnessed part of the ceremony in the Ridderzaal at The Hague where he is  instated as Reichskommissar. [On behalf of the Führer and highest Wehmacht commanders, ] [I now, as the German Wehrmacht commander in the Netherlands, transfer my] [military and civilian powers to Reichs Minister Seys Inquart [As Reichs Kommissar of the occupied territories in the Netherlands] [According to the wish of the Führer power is trasfered from General Frankenhausen to me] [...to be translated...] [....] [....] [....] On the 15th of July 1940 the so-called Orderdienst began its task of redeveloping the country  This service had a military structure and was led by a Dutch Army Major Here he is seen speaking to his Orderdienst troops [....] [....] [....] As early as October 1940 the Reichskommissar Seys Inquart decided to reduce and gradually close the Orderdienst to transform it into the Dutch Labor Social life starts to pick up as well as the Dutch population tries to regain the typical Dutch coziness called "Gezelligheid" typical for the pre-war era. In view of the curfew [....] At the beginning of World War II the Dutch national socialist movement NSB  a kind of "Netherlands first" party established in 1931 joined forces with the German occupiers as a collaboration party Its leader engineer Anon Mussert was in the assumption that he could politically run the country as part of the new Third Reich during World War II Around 1943 of 101 000 people were a member of this authoritarian anti-democratic movement [Music] In the course of World War II the NSB became more radical, fascist and anti-Semitic For decades the stigma of NSB members having been in the wrong, in Dutch "Fout",  during the war persisted [Music] This is interesting footage of an NSB WWeerbaarheids Afdeling (WA) parade marching on the Damrak and the Dam in Amsterdam on the 9th of November 1940. It is rather astonishing to see the number of Spectators lining the route and making the NSB "Houzee" salute the WA was the militarized entity of the NSB better designated as "riff raff in uniform" They were called The Zwarthemden, black shirts, and were extremely violent to Jews On the 1st of May 1941 Anton Mussert held this speech:  "It is our firm conviction that the 1st of May will be a Day of Unity in the whole of Europe (etc.) [Music] [Music] Part one of our series about the Netherlands in Wartime ends here in In subsequent episodes I will dig deeper into this period in the Netherlands history You will have noticed a much higher quality of video enhancement and especially the colorization. This is the result of a new colonization method where by an AI is fed with manually colorized reference frames The AI then tries to keep track  of the objects in the reference frames Here is a slideshow of nearly all the manually created colorized reference frames Thanks for watching!

P332	https://youtu.be/huvStjScFvM?si=0igfmxqDcCjIHox9	well hey B it's Jamie D me here welcome back to the channel honey listen I want to get into some things and what I want to talk about is this teacher over on Tik Tok who has his students taking down his braids I guess he has a hair appointment of some sort and I want to get into it um I've been saying it swarm all around social media but I have not actually gotten a chance to really check it out wholeheartedly so we're about to do that together okay make sure that you guys are indeed coming into the video  you are liking up the channel okay subscribing to the channel as well if you're not subscribed and make sure that you're cutting on your notification Bells okay so without further Ado let us go ahead and hop into this video to see exactly what uh this teacher has to say about this um let's check it out stream my students helping me take my hair out there was quite the discourse in the chat which had people saying this was inappropriate and other people saying this was completely fine there was nothing wrong with what I was doing and  people were just making it weird so of course I had to bring this issue to the big stage I would like to represent myself in this case your honor if I may number one for little context I had a hair appointment immediately after school and I needed my hair taken out beforehand I would have taken it out the night before but that Friday we had a camera crew coming in to shoot a promotional video and I was one of the ones being interviewed so I had to look presentable so I didn't take my hair out I didn't have the time to do it  all myself cuz it would have taken me forever so naturally I asked about four or five of my over over a 100 best friends to assist me in taking my hair out and they all agreed number two this was at the end of class this week we were doing stem fair presentations since it was Friday and all of my students did an excellent job on their stem fair projects and presentations I told them if we get one solid presentation in this class I'll end class a little early and they can have fun and play basketball  darts or be on their phones or whatever and during that time my team would help me take my hair out a couple of these were students from my class but others were students from other classes I would all of them a pass at the beginning of the class period requesting their assistance 10 minutes before dismissal I told the teachers only send them if all of their work was completed and they had good behavior they all met the criteria so 10 minutes before dismissal they showed up for their job my next point I  like to make is if I was a female teacher those people wouldn't be in the comments saying oh this is weird this is inappropriate cuz me personally I don't think there's anything weird about this people are saying oh that's too intimate to me it's literally just hair it doesn't have to be weird some people have never had cool teachers in the shows I personally believe that building authentic relationships with students is Paramount in being an Effective Teacher I make sure my students know and can  feel that I care about them beyond the schoolwork and all the stuff that I have to make them do I take the time to get to know my students outside of academics because caring for the whole child is what's important some of these students have been with me since I was was a substitute 4 years ago they see me as a big brother or a father figure as some of them say and me I don't want kids of my own so all of these kids are literally my children and in case you're wondering about their parents most of  them follow me on social media and always talk about my videos with their kids they always tell me that they're so grateful that their kids have someone like me in their life and my admin they're well aware of my social media presence and they love my videos to me this is just another wholesome moment that I'm having with my kids that I was fortunate enough to catch on film since I'm a science teacher one thing that I teach my students about is symbiosis symbiosis deals with the relationships between organisms the type of  relationship that I like to Foster in my class is mutualism or mutualistic relationship which means both organisms benefit from The Exchange so when my students have good behavior complete all their assignments and do everything that a scholar is supposed to do I reward them with downtime and just time to just be a kid be on their phones play games gossip so on and so forth my students and I work hard and we play harder I'm fortunate enough to have students that feel safe and comfortable around me safe  to come to me with their problems their frustrations they come to me seeking guidance and wisdom or come to me simply to chill and hang out because they know that they have a safe space to be themselves around me what I strive to do as an educator is be the teacher I wish I had grown up I strive to be the teacher that makes my inner child happy someone that my inner child would be proud of I want to be the teacher that my students reflect back on 20 30 years down the line and think like dang that  teacher I had in middle school he was the no further questions your honor so let me know your thoughts in the comments you think this was inappropriate or people are making something out of nothing and although you are entitled to your opinion all I ask is that you be resp respectful thank you all right so y'all just got a chance to check out that video and you know when I first saw it um my initial thought was like oh this is so inappropriate like what the hell does he think he doing and you know after I  listened to this video just now um nothing has changed I still feel the same goddamn way I felt the first time you could play however much classical music you want to play and talk as soft as you want to talk but in my personal this is uh inappropriate um I feel like everything that he said he was on point with um you know the relationships between students and teachers but then also when you allow students to get this comfortable in spaces it could lead to inappropriate behavior or misunderstandings of some sort um in my  personal and you know he talks about you know I feel like a lot of you people may have never had a cool teacher and I understand that but then at the same time a lot of people have had cool teachers in the school and a lot of times not all but quite a bit of the times those cool teachers have been caught up in rumors of them doing inappropriate things with students so why would you want to put yourself in a position for that to possibly happen where somebody could put these allegations out there on you and then  some of the videos like this they use against you in court at some point you know what I'm saying um and you know how one would set it up you know in court or whatever they can all easily turn a simple video as a lot of people may view it like this one into something that's extremely like salacious or whatever we see it all the time with media but um yeah I I I'm just I understood what he was saying and it was really the soft classical music and you listening and it's like okay I see what you're saying but no my dog  like that's still inappropriate um to me I just can't and I'm not going to let my child take nobody hair down especially a stranger if you ain't going to pay like run my kid their coins what this supposed to be for extra credit or some something or something like what is we why what was the purpose of even filming this and putting this off on social media and see the other thing for me is it's the students identity what if I'm a parent who don't post my child on social media and what if I'm trying to you know  conceal the school that my child goes to and you're over here putting them on display on social media like I kind of feel way about that you know even though he tried to you know answer that too and say most of my students or some of my students parents know that I put them on social media yeah I hear you say that but do we know that those children's parents know that you put them on social media you see what I'm saying um I probably would have felt the way if I would have saw that video and that was  my child in the video like what the like explain this situ why you got my child taking your hair down like what is that about you ain't give me no call ahead of time I understand it was like at the last few minutes of class and these are some of the good students some of my best students are the ones that I had come and they were so great in school they were so fantastic that I chose them to take my hair down like m I feel like that's still giving a bit of tacky in my personal I do feel like um  in my personal it was just it was inappropriate I understand that you're on crunch time and I understand that you have a hair appointment and things that you need to get done but I also feel like you should have did it yourself okay I hate to say it like I mean or just pay a five pay the five if you can afford to pay the five pay the five and just have somebody just had a person take your hair down on you get there to get your hair done you know um it did you know as I I mean to me it did kind of look a bit innocent as  I'm watching and I'm listening to him talk you know um but at the same time as innocent as it may have seem with the young ladies taking the hair down it still seemed a bit inappropriate especially for you to want to film it for social media and put them on display like that's my biggest thing like what if somebody's trying not to let everybody know what school they child attends and you got they ass all on social media like did you get clearance for that was there a letter that sent that was sent home for the parents that  was an approval of oh hey um can we get your permission you know sometimes what we like to do is we like to film um you know Tik toks and just want to get your approval that it's okay for your child to be filmed on Tik Tok like I ain't like that um and then another thing he said that a lot of my students see me as a big brother this that that and the other um that's a lot that's not all you don't know how those kids may see you you know a lot of times I do feel like you have older people teachers and stuff  who are just trying to be kind to you know the students or whatnot and they may take that kindness in a different type of way it's been plenty of times I know when I was in school around their age I would hear some of my friends and others have a crush on one of the handsome teachers in school or whatever not that the teacher will ever cross the line with them but you know doing little stuff like this make them feel like oh I probably got a chance or whatever ain't no telling what's going on with these  people heads so in these in these kids heads I just feel like when it's a situation like this in my personal I just um let's lower these type of conversations from happening by not engaging in this type of stuff I mean you know that's just like I just I don't know y'all I I mean I understand how people want to water it down and say oh you know it's just hair it's really not that big of a deal like it's not that deep but as soon as y'all come out with something soon as something happen or pop off y'all will be using this very  video as a reference to explain said person's poor Behavior you know what I'm saying like y'all should have known when y'all saw this D if this man got caught up in some stuff in the past or anything in the future this is going to be a video used to reference any allegations like you know and then I feel like I know you're trying to be you know a great person to these students a teacher that cares about them outside of school and all of that and I get that and I do think we need teachers like that but at  the same time I feel like if you're if you got them taking your hair down in class what other things do you have them doing that makes them feel a bit too comfortable to where if it came down to a situation of getting themselves or or you out of trouble they'll like they may just throw some allegations out there on you and then now you're having to defend yourself like I just yeah I can't let it fly for me you know I mean but if that's what everybody else feels and that's how y'all Rock like it's not that deep it's just hair  and if you people that are saying it's just hair have children and you feel like you'll be okay with then cool um if you're a person that probably don't have no kids and you looking at it like hey you know um I think nothing's wrong with that well then maybe when you have your child you might feel the same or you might feel differently I know me as a parent I don't want no like that okay I don't want my child taking your hair down okay I feel like you can be a friend to a student and also have clear  clear lines for them to know that I'm your teacher okay don't get too friendly with me think you going to come over here and take my hair down or none of that like it's a way to be cool and then it's also a way to you know draw the line just like you know as being a parent knowing that you are you know in a position of authority but also at the same time like not being too um I guess uh I don't want to say harsh but harsh of a lack of lack of better word not being too distant with your kid that  they can't have honest conversations with you and all of that so it's just like really I I just I for me as a parent I would not want my child taking down a teacher's hair uh male or female okay um son or daughter meaning teacher meaning whether the teacher is a woman whether the teacher is a man whether my child is a girl but what I don't want them participating in that and I damn sure don't want nobody putting my child on social media as you're sitting there what it looks like your School logo on  it so people know like I mean I think that's my biggest issue and that's crazy because it's really bigger than them taking down the hair in a sense it's like like how you know these parents really want their child on camera and then it being on display where they child go to school at like I don't know I don't really like this but I'm going let y'all do what y'all want to do cuz y'all going to do it do that anyway cuz how y'all is hello but y'all leave y thoughts in comments down below and let me know whether you felt like it was  that big of a deal whether you felt like it wasn't a big that big of a deal and keep in mind this my personal my personal ain't your personal okay and that's okay don't be trying to attack me girl for my personal cuz I don't see stuff the way that you do understand and I'm probably never going to see it the same way but that's just where we at all right so you guys leave your thoughts and comments down below I'm Jamie that's me uh follow me on Instagram and Twitter at Jamie that's me and I will catch you  guys in the next one bye-bye my city

S8	https://youtu.be/xMy-CcwYzjA?si=WitOGTBJfxpRqc0r	all right late night World War II emergency update we got some Insider Intel from our friend of the channel Rafi Farber who is currently on the ground in Israel and he sent us a message about what is going on there and we got to talk about everything that is happening on the ground there we also have to talk about some other geopolitical Oddities and entities mostly pertaining to World War III in Ukraine but let's first start with the topic of gold gold hit a brand new record again feels like every day I'm  saying the same damn thing gold hit a new record of $2,320 20 bucks more than yesterday but that $20 signifies an increase in market cap of around $130 billion in real terms because the USD that it's measured in has remained relatively stable over the last 6 months so we're talking about a $4 trillion r valuation of gold purely organically driven okay you're not hearing about this in the media uh this is being driven by Central Bank purchases by maybe some rich guys whales you know maybe some institutions maybe some hedge  funds quietly hedging but by and large this is purely organic this is not speculative fomo you know the retail investor has barely even entered the market yet in fact a lot of dealers of uh metals are saying that they're running out of metals to sell so that's how bad it is getting so what that tells you is two things is that the media is suppressing the price of gold okay they're they're not talking about this they have to talk about it a little bit but they're not talking about it too much because if they talk about  it a lot that means they have to provide an analysis as to why the price of gold is going up that's going to Spook the markets it's going to Peak the interest of the retail investor everybody's going to fomo in the price is going to Skyrocket and that means that the central banks and the Really wealthy people and even the other nations who are currently hoarding that and other Commodities are going to have to pay more for it they're trying to postpone that as long as possible they know that if they were to make a big deal of this  like they do with Bitcoin and all the other speculative distractions that people are going to start a new tulip craze and they are going to fomo the price it's going to be a melt up there's going to be a bit of a blowoff top there'll be a slight correction but by and large the price is going to stay highly elevated for an extended period of time they don't want that this is a barometer for social chaos right now pretty much every commodity is skyrocketing in price we're talking about Oil we're talking about copper  cocoa coffee uh orange juice the list goes on all the Commodities that are supposed to be depreciating at this point in time or being you know showing a reduction deflation or even disinflation we're not seeing that for the most part and that's because a lot of countries are stockpiling these commodities for War for the multi-polar World War III scenario that awaits us all now rafy Farber has indicated in a tweet that he tagged Us in he's a friend of the channel he breaks down in an interview that we did around 6 months  ago where he predicted that things were going to start to really get crazy right around now he talks about how the gold how gold and precious metals are the foundation of our financial system everything derives its value from gold and his prediction is that when the whole Fiat derivative scheme collapses everything will be revaluated according to Gold proportionately so so 1 ounce of gold you know he's saying it could be 30,000 50,000 100,000 I'm not saying that that's not Financial advice but uh it  appears as though it could happen anyways what he's saying with respect to what's going on in Israel right now is that the Bank of Israel in a secret message to banks have advised them to prepare for a run on the ATMs this is due to the imminent Homefront command media blitz warning residents to prepare for war so right now the Israeli government is scaring the out of the population uh because of course they target targeted three Brigadier generals of the Iranians at the Iranian Consulate in Syria which is effectively in active  War because it's on Iranian soil other high-ranking uh Iranian officials went down as well they are expecting a retaliation in fact the CIA released a memo yesterday that said that they are expecting in the next 48 hours there's going to be a retaliation now they're making it out as if this is going to come directly from Iran and uh I mean we'll talk about some of the reasons why I don't think that's very likely but on the topic of this ATM situation this is all the more reason I want to give some practical advice right  now cash is going to be king in the early phases of any collapse scenario you need cash now first and foremost you have to ask yourself why would I need cash okay well maybe you have to evacuate and maybe you lose all your preps that's really the only reason why because anything that you would need cash for you should be prepping for first but everybody has a plan until they get punched in the mouth as Mike Tyson says so you have to have that backup plan first and foremost as much as some people like to stack precious  metals and I'm not really one of those people but I understand this the importance of precious metals um one thing that you have to do is make sure that you have a lot of cash on hand because e ATMs are going to be cleaned out very quickly because you got to remember something else we are now in a debit based credit card-based Society there simply is not as much physical cash in circulation as there used to be so there's not nearly enough cash for the entire population there now they have a culture of preparedness as far as  I know most people there go through basic training in the military they're indoctrinated with all that stuff and I'm sure they learn a few skills as well they all have access to safety shelters they all know the drill and the Israelis have been preparing for you know World War III for some period of time so they're probably more insulated from a major crisis like this than we are here in the west but don't discount cash in the early phases of collapse yeah a few months go by people don't believe in the financial system  anymore then maybe your silver your precious metals your jewelry or your Commodities and barter that's going to come in handy but in the initial phases of the disaster cash will be King okay so make sure you have some on hand now here's what else is going on in Israel as I said they're on a high state of alert they are waiting for reprisal from the Iranians I don't think it's going to come from Iran Iran is going to view this as a provocation by the Israelis to go them into the conflict that Israel  needs right now Benjamin Netanyahu needs a conflict okay for starters it gets gets all of those protesters off the street you see how convenient it is to have air raid sirens and uh all these threats that people you know got to make sure they know where the shelters are and all the shelters are open it scares people away from protesting and night after night from what I'm told there's been a lot of protest activity in Israel this is a great way to suppress those protests okay so they want a war and I  don't know how they plan on waging it I don't think our Western ERS or the Israelis for that matter really think that far ahead I don't think they thought this one through there's no way you're going to win a war with Iran even if it goes nuclear it's just going to be a bloody miserable mess for everybody involved so is Iran going to attack Israel directly I highly doubt it they're going to do it by proxy recall that a few months ago they targeted a I believe it was they claim the Iranians claim it was a Massad agent in Syria and  his family or something like that and it was the longest range ballistic missile that Iran ever shot from its territory into another country apparently now they could do that into Israel they could launch just tons of missiles and they could probably you know destroy the Israeli power grid they could destroy the Demona nuclear power plant and that would trigger the Samson option and the United States would get involved it would be World War III they're not going to do that what they're going to do is  they're going to attack via proxy they're going to activate their proxies in the surrounding regions and this is just I'm not a military expert in this region I'm not there but Common Sense would dictate they want a modulated response they need a measured response so that it doesn't escalate vertically but they also don't want to be viewed as a paper tiger so the Optics of this are important to the theocracy in Iran as much as they are somewhat objectivists like the the Russian in some ways in terms of how they wage war meaning that  they're not going to be triggered into an immediate reaction they will likely settle for a puic response meaning that the response might not even accomplish much but it will appease their population who are going to say well at least they did something and it will seem like a small victory a retaliation and Redemption for the loss of their generals but what they likely won't do yet even though they're they're preparing for it the Iranians are preparing for war with Israel full-blown War there's a reason why they're  building all those bunkers and stockpiling all that that is going to be used someday but I think they want to do it on their own terms but if we know that the war in the Middle East is inevitable then both sides are incentivized to go on the initiative so if you know that war is coming why would you wait for the 50 F-15 Strike Eagle jets that the American an are now sending to the Israelis as a part of this $8 billion Aid package these Jets apparently I don't know much about it but I'm suspecting that they have a  longer range so these are the Jets that they're going to use if they do uh stage an attack on the Iranian nuclear facilities that are now completed and no longer as thoroughly being monitored by the international atomic energy agency these are all underground so that tells you that the Iranian are preparing for this thing this is what they've been preparing for so if you know that that's about to happen why would you seize upon the opportunity from the Iranian and the proxy and all the other Arab countries  in the region why would you seize upon that opportunity and go on the initiative right now of course Israel has nukes or America has nukes let's be honest okay that's really kind of what's going on here I think and that's where a lot of Israel's nuclear ambiguity uh comes into play is that it's probably really the American stuff uh anyways so they're going to utilize the Samson option it's going to get nuclear it's going to get ugly what I think is going to happen hopefully for now war is coming there that that's basically  guaranteed at this point that they're going to start a war with Hezbollah and is going to be destructive to both sides uh you know the Israelis have what are these 1500 lb bombs 2,000 lb bombs JM bombs that they're getting ready and uh that's going to rake Havoc it's not going to destroy the underground tunnel Network systems and I don't think that the Israelis have enough missile defense I don't think that the population there truly realizes the Hellfire that is going to rain down when the war actually  begins it is going to be brutal GPS jamming abound throughout the entire region okay Israel is counseling vacation calls for their reservist who they just relieved of Duty due to the operations starting to not wind down I mean they're going to wind up again in Rafa but in other parts of Northern Gaza 77,000 reservists have been called up they're opening up Emergency Shelters it's very likely that Iran is now going to accelerate its nuclear program in response to this what other option do they have okay so that this is what's  going to happen they're going to accelerate so and this is the self-fulfilling prophecy of all of this this was all to prevent Iran from getting nuclear weapons and now Iran is going to feel insecure enough that they need to have nuclear weapons people are supposedly fleeing hia as well now in terms of the other geopolitical Oddities that are going on right now Emanuel macron has reiterated that France does not need NATO's support in Ukraine basically saying that article 5 will not be triggered when the troops start  filing in now according to Maria zacharova spokesperson for the Russian government she says that 1,500 French troops will be deployed to Ukraine in April and that it's already approved right now they are on full combat Readiness in April to deploy to the Ukrainian theater of operations very likely assisting in Logistics in the rear but I don't think it will take long for them to uh permeate the entirety of uh the country in some capacity and basically just be intermixed with the uh Ukrainian military Russia has done a  ballistic missile test they did they did a strategic missile test on the cura Missile Range on the Far Eastern Arctic Coast apparently the US in response to this two US Air Force rc135s uh ballistic missile tracking aircraft were put up in the air and why this is important because I don't think that the Russians notified this us about this because there did not appear to be any communication usually NORAD would issue some sort of uh advisory that Russia had notified them and that this was a standard test and all that stuff  but because there's no more treaties this is uh very concerning because of course the United States has a policy called launch on warning and what that means oops what that means is essentially if they detect that the Russians are launching nuclear missiles then that is grounds for them to launch everything that they have so perhaps this was the Russians uh putting the Americans on notice perhaps this is just the way that they were trying to test us to see what our response would be and you know that this was a trial run  because what you'd want to see is okay if we were going to do a decapitation strike if we were going to attempt the first strike we got to test it out first we want to see what's going to happen when we put just one in the air we know there's a 95% chance that the Americans are just going to know it's a test and they're not going to launch everything but let's just see what they do what kind of planes do they put in the air what kind of jets do they scramble what do they do okay and I think that's what  this was about they're trying to smoke us out of our holes so that's serious that's sending us a warning shot cuz right now here's what's going on this is crazy zalinski bought a house in Britain did you hear about this in the news I highly doubt it zalinsky bought a house in Britain this is 100% fact as far as I know okay I hope I hope it is because you you know you guys know how I feel about providing you with valid and uh information that is you know that you can take to the bank for 20 million  pound British pounds he bought a home from Charles III okay who else is currently residing in the UK his old buddy valer Zusi right now zalinski is replacing his entire Cabinet why is he doing this well some people speculate like myself included that maybe the war isn't going so well maybe NATO is getting ready to take over the Reigns which is why the French foreign minister was on a phone call today with Sergey shyu the Russian defense minister and uh zilinski is going to do some sort of leadership from  Exile thing and spend his remaining days just hopping from one mansion into another $20 million now I'm not knocking the guy hustle okay I mean boy was it a hustle actually some people might call it quite the racket I mean we're talking about over a hundred billions of dollars dumped into this whole scheme okay and this guy has the audacity to just buy a$2 million mansion in the UK while telling everybody that the war is going great people aren't evacuating from kov which they are by the way that's now  confirmed I've been talking about that one for the last 2 days I was a little uncertain that I was giving you guys false information but it it's turns out that it is in fact true but this is this is bad because this means that he's really getting ready to leave the country and uh leave from Exile that's what this appears to be because right now they're saying that the Russians are getting ready to do an offensive and that it's going to happen likely in the next couple months if the ukrainians can't get the artillery that they need  to fend them off and of course we have more threats from the Ukrainian foreign minister demitro kba or kaliba saying that I'm not exaggerating when I say that Europe will be at War and missiles will fall on Brussels Patriot systems can intercept missiles in Ukraine or they will do so in Europe and he references the fact that right now the ukrainians have been given seven Patriot systems but 100 Patriot systems are still available according to them so I don't know how many missiles are had for said systems but uh I would say that  that's just another threat now what's going on in kov I've been talking about this for the last two days came out today according to the statement uh by kov by the kov mayor in the second most populous city in Ukraine all critical energy infrastructure facilities have been partially disabled and it's going to cost them $1 billion to fix 10 billion okay so you can't tell me that that grid is not severely compromised when it's going to cost you 10 billion unless that's just another racket that they're putting up they're  probably just throwing out numbers uh regardless it's confirmed that there is in fact evacuations going on in the surrounding regions there's more bombardments there tonight as I'm doing this video so I think that's only only going to ramp up so that's pretty much confirmed guys that uh the shit's hitting the fan in Ukraine my polish Source has responded to an inquiry I made last night where I asked the question out loud about what poles think what do polls actually think about potentially going to war and this is  what he had to say and this is important because of course that's the most likely next front I'd say after Maldova Lithuania he says an answer is an opinion poll published today which reads that only 11% of those questions declared that they would go to the uh the fight on the front whilst 20% declared that they would immediately leave Poland 20% one in five can you imagine the congested roadways the rest would state that they would stay but only in support in a non-combatant rule however in The  crucial age bracket of 18 to35 nearly 30% said they would immediately get out of Dodge that's not a lot of commitment unless there is some massive false flag operation to motivate people to partake in such a conflict I don't think it's going to happen that's what you would need to have happen you need to build up that hatred of Russia for it to happen but it might not be Russia that's the irony they might turn on each other they might turn on the ukrainians who knows at this point in time and uh there's some other information  here I'm not sure it will be that relevant but the Minister of Defense in Poland has stated that in current situation there is no alternative but to direct all resources to the war economy in light of that he said because Armament factories which belong to the government cannot keep up with demand private companies will now be contracted to also move to making Munitions and other military equipment zalinski claims that Russia is mobilizing he's claiming that the Russians are planning on mobilizing another 300,000 people by  June 1st now the Russians are claiming we don't need that we get 30,000 volunteers a month in fact I think on the week of the crocus uh terrorist attacks they got another like 18,000 applications or something so but I will say though you know usually the saying is where there's smoke there's fire usually with what the ukrainians say or zalinski you know where there's smoke there's like some smoldering coals you know buried under some dirt somewhere uh but I do think that there's probably something to it because you never can  really trust what the Russians say either and uh I would not be surprised if they did plan on mobilizing a lot more troops in fact if they do want to uh fully see through what they've committed to which is creating a sanitary Zone and that's from the horses MTH Vladimir Putin himself all the way up to laviv Lavo whatever you want to call it then they're going to need a hell of a lot of troops even if even if Ukraine is only relegated to using their miniature dragons teeth and very limited artillery okay uh even if the French  troops don't come you know it's going to take a lot of Manpower in order to do what they need to do and then you're talking of course about Guerilla Warfare after that so you need enough you need a lot of troops on the ground to uh keep a population that large in line so I guess we're going to see what's going to happen but Sparks are going to fly soon guys I would not be surprised that by the time I woke up tomorrow morning we had more big news to talk about and oh yeah the price of coffee you might want  to start stocking up because not only is the price of cocoa skyrocketing but apparently coffee has now gone up another 50% in like the last last what is it 8 months that's insane so keep on prepping folks thanks for watching don't forget to like comment subscribe can name PR bro 	Conservative			Leaning Liberal	211

S55	https://youtu.be/agjNW3BPyoE?si=dq5NYYd6Z0oya3_a	what's up my name is and I'll be reacting to one of the videos you guys end up requesting the most both lift and told tale of 911 but before you go into the video let me ask you for one thing if you can leave a like thank you so much for that it's the best way to show support for you so easy for me can mean so much now if you can subscribe you make my day have that in consideration if you want to give me some extra support take a look at my patreon no pressure at all English not my main language any Mis pronunciation I'm sorry  for that and I leave the link for the original video on the description let's go into this one and see what this is about um again 911 crazy moment for sure I remember I was a kid when this actually happened and the the memory I have I was actually watching TV and all of the sudden here in Portugal the emission Cuts basically and starts talking about what's going on in New York and I remember as a kid that was kind of strange for for me but I automatic felt the pain of a lot of people there because the image end up  being quite quite brutal and until this I um it's feel something that I not sure if I should say this but I almost feel sorry for Americans but it is what it is my friends let's play it I thought I was watching a movie Towering Inferno at first and then I looked real close and I noticed it was the World Trade Center I was compelled because I'm a type of person I Can't Stand By and Watch other people suffer and to me they were suffering they wanted to get off the island and there was no way for them  to get off the island other than the water I'm sorry for pausing again I know this this is probably heavy video but one of the image that stays with me until these days I remember watching and I'm not even sure why they end up showing that on TV or at least me as a kid I should should have not seen that but I remember people actually jumping off the the the towers and looking at that I was like Jesus this is and I had noticed when I was watching the television I saw a lot of you know the fairies going up into the slips and  taking people off I say fine we could do the same thing I could take people on my boat get in there take them where they have to go and that's what we did [Music] crazy to see this I I I don't know why I mean I know why but so many years already on the morning of September 11th when the towers came down millions of people ran for safety hundreds of thousands of them ran South to the water's edge that's when they realized that Manhattan is indeed an island and that they were trapped they were feeling helpless and that's the worst  feeling in the world what was a person on the grounds going to do buildings were down there were people laying under the rubble of the building fire storting for pausing again but those guys you know we all like to watch my movies but we have real heros with us and those are the ones wom civilians my wife was there and I turned around I says I've got to go do something just like that and she looked at me she says what are you going to do you maniac I says I'm going to take the amberjack up into the City and help she  says but what if they're attacked again I says well then that's something I have to live with I says I have to do what I have to do I says then nobody can stop me right now I okay I actually never thought about that when the First Responders end up going yeah you don't know if the attacks are over that's crazy and you have to be so brave for that man man I respect this guy so much even if I save one person I rescue one person that's one person less that will suffer and die I agree [Music] how about the evacuation they were  trying to evacuate Manhattan because nobody knew what was going on you know you didn't know something else was going to happen it was just a you know a Madness on one side and you know and wanting to help people on the other side they were just okay sorry for pausing but actually I believe I know the answer for this one but since now I have American all this I can take a lot of thoughts away at this time this region was super super populated and one of the key regions in America right uh in terms  of businesses stuff like that I I think I'm correct on that but screaming out of the buildings in the first mode of transportation they saw was a ferry boat that's when they knew this is how I'm getting out of here they didn't even care where the boat was going there wasn't panic in New York in the beginning just volume it wasn't until the first building fell that there was Panic you heard the building go down but we're in the slip so we can't see it that's when we started Letting Go and all of a sudden engulfed you couldn't  see anything in come in people were actually jumping into the river Jesus I never saw those image actually dude I don't care what are your political views religion Etc there is nothing that we we should not accept this type of behavior it is what it is my friend I I know you guys had a strong response after that but come on I mean those those part of what people honestly and swimming out of Manhattan Boats were very nearly running them over wait wait wait these people wanted Adam Manhattan no matter any way they could somebody  wants you to go over there so crazy every mode of transportation out of Manhattan was shut down all the Subways were shut tunnels were all closed they closed the bridges they closed everything immediately boats usually an afterthought in most New Yorkers Minds were for the first time in over a century the only way in or out of lower manhatt okay the narrator is Tom ANS because I actually a huge friend of him but I'm not realizing that seems like his voice am I crazy about that I guess I can check after the  video the process that actually had already started there were some boats that were grabbing people there people were lined up with the walls there people running on the left on the left on the left it's just human nature you see people in distress on the seaw wall in Manhattan begging you to pick them up you have to you have to pick them up they didn't know what was going on they seen the building getting hit with these two planes as far as they was concerned you know we were been bombed I was  wondering if they were going to come on the boat if if they were had people with bombs or if they were going to come on we're a big orange Target in the middle of that Harbor my job is to keep the boat safe but the passenger safe my crew safe everybody was in shock running around they didn't want to leave their family they had loved ones running around the city anybody has a baby nobody has it there was one guy ran from the apron this is heavy video honestly guys um because is you can't imagine  all because you don't know what's going on maybe it's like first world war starting or something crazy like that and you are what the hell 100% people thought that maybe right maybe there will be atomic bomb or something because you really don't know is is who are the ones attacking maybe people in other states they have a better idea but leaving there is you are completely going going crazy man he jumped onto the boat he grabbed onto the metal climbed up right next to the pil so I'm going out there  to say something he slides down to the next deck so the the deck can't get him and go what you know what are you doing he goes I'm jumping for my life so you know you couldn't argue with them there there was a small boat that was uh at the lower tip of Manhattan I thought the boat was going to flip over cuz so many people were trying to get on and as I looked behind there they were just 10 Deep and that's kind of what gave us the idea we decided that this has to get better organized and we better do it and that's what we  did so we decided to make the call on the radio all available boats this is the United States Coast Guard board the pilot boat New York anyone want to help with the evacuation of lower Manhattan report to Governor's [Music] Island when that call came on the radio they were coming I was uncertain of who was going to respond to about 15 20 minutes later they're just boats all across the Horizon l man Jesus see sometimes you lose the figh in humanity but you see this type of stuff and you gain the fight in humanity again  you know and again this is yeah this is bananas Lally 100 targets converging on the low Manhattan when we came out of that dust clap tug bolts I've never seen so many tug bolts all at once there was just a like a Fleet of tugbo headed to Manhattan if it floated and it could get there it got there all different size shapes and forms I mean and they were zooming across this water fairies private boats party boats I worked on the water for 28 years I've never seen that many boats come together at one time that fast one radio called  and it just came together just that fast man amazing on on you you guys honestly on you as as a nation because this shows how you know if one go everyone goes but looking at all of those Sports actually I makes me think you know that uh one of the reasons the United States is powerful is is just not because you guys have a great military I also believe is even though I think is is is getting a bit soft nowadays but is how strong you guys can in in the difficult moment you guys can be so so close and I I love  that hundreds of boats converged on the city leaving the sunbathed harbor behind them I did not know about this the [Music] unknown that was something I won't forget it was just low dark accurate black smoke it's like there was a big chimney in Manhattan when we pulled into pure 11 the dust was unbelievable and then out of nowhere they just kept on seeing people coming they look like zombies coming through the fog and you knew that they were those were human beings Jesus Christ honestly this is a good  reminder to to us nowadays because sometimes I believe we forget the all all evil can can can appear all of the S you know don't leave us please don't leave us here take us need help do you need help do you need help at that point the Coast Guard said not how many people are you allowed how many people can you fit come on guys anybody coming you get your ass over here now now come on boat start started hanging literally would take a bed sheet off a bunk and and a can of spray paint and paint their destination  [Music] on some of these people never been in the water never been on a boat before Housewives workers that do windows we had Executives and the thing that was the best thank you everyone help I love that you know again I for the ones have been following this channel you guys know most of my videos is me just doing some you know weak jokes or you know soft jokes let's put things that way but uh I also like to react to to this stuff and actually I have a question um at the time I believe George W Bush was the President  right but nowadays I feel like that President there there is a lot of split in terms of opinions if he was a good pres or not but I don't even care about that to be honest I just want to know if you guys think he actually end up handling handling the situation well because to be to be honest this is a crazy situation it's not like even the best pres president you have in your mind if this happens this is completely chaotic but you guys think the situation could have been and a little bit better  but you know it is what it is you know at the time basically it is what he could hand come on board get ins I saw four businessmen lifting up an old woman with a seeing eye dog a German shepherd and they lifted her up like a surfboard and passed her over the handrails when we would carry a load of people over and there was somebody standing there that seen their husband or wife you know that made us feel even better you know well at least we got two back together you know keep on going you know the guy that works at the ferry  he's a a welder his son was on my boat he he actually came up he than me we went back and forth all day long carrying boot loads as many as our our boat would hold and it was a lot of people a lot of people you couldn't have planned nothing to happen that fast that quick no training this was just people doing what they had to do that day you forget all about what you're supposed to do what the teach in school and you say you know what morally this is the right way to go and deep down this is what I'm  going to do average people amazing they stepped up and uh when they needed to they showed me you know when the American people need to come together and pull together they will do it I do feel a away honored that I was a part of it I was the greatest thing I ever did with my life the greatest day that I've ever seen in all my boating I mean my life on the water the great Boat Lift I mean real heroes I because again at the time you have no idea what's going on maybe there is some some attacks that that could  actually go into the water and those guys say you know what forget about if I die I die I I love it of 911 became the largest sea evacuation in history larger than the evacuation of Dunkirk in World War II where 339,000 British and French soldiers were rescued over the course of 9 days on 9911 nearly nearly 500,000 civilians were rescued from Manhattan by boat it took less than 9 hours amazing amazing amazing video I believe somebody has a little hero in them you got to look in and it's in there it'll come out if need to be I  have one theory in life I never want to say the word I should have if I do it and I fail I try man this guy look is he speaking facts the entire video honestly I mean who is this guy I I man he's speaking real facts if I do it and I succeed better for me I tell my children the same thing never go through life saying you should have if you want to do something you do it oh Nar by I I knew this okay it was a heavy video my friends I I again I'm I'm never sure if I almost should upload this type of reactions  because you know I mean I I'm an emotional person to be honest and I I I feel the the even the memories are tough for for me because I know this end up not happening to me but you can imagine the the the B end this was I I love the video do not forget to leave a like guys see you guys soon bye 	Conservative			Center	214
S58	https://youtu.be/yDyJe1nmSOM?si=9skiOOyCVUgObrvZ	this episode of the y-files is brought to you by pdsdet Stanley Kubrick is considered one of the greatest filmmakers of all time of his 13 movies a few are considered Classics but in 1968 Kubrick released 2001 A Space Odyssey and this is more than a classic it's a masterpiece and widely regarded as one of the best science fiction films of all time and probably the most influential this collaboration with science fiction author Arthur C Clarke tells the story of an alien intelligence that visited Earth in the  distant past and left behind artifacts in the solar system the movie features groundbreaking special effects which still hold up today in fact the effects looked so good that the movie gave the American government an idea billions of tax dollars were invested in the space program but the Soviets were still years ahead of the United States NASA desperately needed to get to the moon before Russia but they knew it was impossible so they turned to one of the world's best filmmakers for help because  when it came to the Moon if they couldn't make it they fake it thank you I mean what's the worst that can happen [Music] I told you to stop messing with that thing it's full of many demons oh come on how bad could it be don't do it hey look I don't have time to babysit you right now I sent you an important

sound financial decision [Music] you know this isn't healthy right I know oh look I gotta go uh but straight that document well yeah it's got my real name on it really your real name  [Music] from the moment that Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin set foot on the moon on July 20th 1969 rumors were circulating that the whole thing was faked that's because it was fake yeah I know you believe that I believe it because it's true well we're gonna explore the theory but they're not a theory the moon landing was fake yeah but can you be quiet for one minute while I set this up please fine fine go ahead shut up your theory thank you it was fake science journalist Richard C Hoagland wrote in his 2007 book dark mission that  he saw NASA press officers helping distribute Flyers to the Press saying the landing was faked even though the astronauts brought back hundreds of moon rocks and took thousands of photographs of the Moon some people simply didn't believe it considering the technology of the time going to the moon and back sounded like science fiction at one point almost 30 percent of the American public believe the moon landings had been faked and this started to show up in pop culture in the 1971 movie diamonds are forever there's a sequence  where Sean Connery as James Bond breaks into a warehouse and there he finds government agents filming a fake moon landing sequence he steals a weird looking moon buggy to escape [Applause] yeah that thing is almost as ugly as the Tesla cyber truck a few years later the movie Capricorn 1 starring James Brolin and O.J Simpson was released oh did OJ find a real killers yet ah not yet but I'm sure they're hiding on a golf course out there somewhere Capricorn one told the story of a fake Mission to Mars as  Millions all over the world watched and listened the president of the United States spoke to the astronauts across the vastness of space there's only one small catch it never happened it's all a lie so because of these and other high-profile references the idea of a fake moon landing conspiracy really took off in the 1970s now the 70s had the best movies the best music you got a nice Beaver nice Beaver you know how to do it give me that nice Beaver nice Beaver you know how to show it what are you doing yeah that song's  gonna be stuck in my head all day now oh you don't remember that one buddy BG's nice Beaver Night Fever no Night Fever that doesn't even make any sense well what does he have the flu it's nice Beaver it's not well if you spend as much time at Club 54 as I did you know that nice Beaver makes way more sense uh that may be but the song is Night Fever like really disagree the conspiracy faded in the 80s but the internet helped it make a comeback in the late 1990s by the mid-2000s the idea that the moon  landings had been faked caught on with Millennials who weren't alive for the Apollo missions an extremely popular documentary was the BART sabrel film a Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Moon oh isn't that the guy that got punched out by butts the guy you're the one who said you walked on the moon when you didn't call in the kettle black if you ever thought of saying I misrepresented my wife from me you're a coward and a liar and a thief oh that old time it could really throw hands huh he sure could but to be fair  sabriel had been chasing Buzz around with the camera badgering him to swear on the Bible that the moon landing was real Buzz begged the guy to back off which he didn't finally sabriel called him a liar and a coward and he got a knuckle sandwich for his trouble so the moon landing conspiracy was back and popping up all over American pop culture they just start making stuff up yeah like that Neil Armstrong guy have you seen him on the talk shows any alarms didn't mean the first man to walk in the  moon talk about a fish story man and they're buying it okay [Laughter] and when Joe Rogan started questioning the moon landing that exposed a theory to a huge new audience Joe Rogan comic podcaster between 1969 and 1972 they had seven attacks seven seven attempts six of them successful that was the only time in history that a human being has been more than 400 miles above the Earth's surface never heard of him 400 000 people worked on the Apollo project 600 million people watched the moon landing live if this is a hoax it's  the greatest hoax in history bold claims require bold evidence is there evidence that the moon landing was faked lots of it has nobody been to believe in such a long time that's not an eight-year-old's question that's my question the motivation for faking the moon landings was driven by several factors the United States was under tremendous pressure to get to the moon before the Soviets the Soviet Union had already proven they were far ahead of the US in space technology the exploration of space will go ahead  whether we join in it or not and it is one of the Great Adventures of all time and no Nation which expects to be the leader of other nations can expect to stay behind the Soviet Union put the first man-made object in orbit with Sputnik 1 in 1957. they put the first animal in space when Leica the dog was launched with Sputnik 2. Leica didn't survive but in 1960 the Soviets launched two dogs and a bunch of mice and rats that did return safely the first human in space was Yuri Gagarin Valentina tarshkova was the first woman  in space the first multi-person crew the first spacewalk the first spacecraft to reach the moon the first pictures of The Far Side of the Moon and even the first soft landing and transmission from the moon's surface these were all Russian achievements meanwhile America's attempts to catch up were not going well rumors started going around that the Russians were going to put nuclear weapons on the moon we have vowed that we shall not see space filled with weapons of mass destruction but with instruments of knowledge so  there was tremendous public pressure to get there first [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] we choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other thing not because they are easy but because they are hard on July 16 1969 Apollo 11 launched successfully four days later Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin set foot on the Moon [Music] it's one small step for man [Music] in just a few years the United States went from being years behind the Soviets in space exploration to eclipsing all of their achievements to many people this  was just too good to be true so Skeptics started pouring over photographs and film looking for evidence of a hoax and the evidence was everywhere the first clue of a hoax was that the astronauts seemed to be casting shadows in two different directions but the sun is the only Light Source on the moon on Earth Shadows run parallel on the Moon Not only did Shadows Go in different directions but sometimes they were at right angles to each other the only way to explain this is multiple light sources like you'd get on a movie  soundstage studio lights would also explain the shot in a vacuum with only a single light source the Shadows on the moon should be absolutely completely black but there's a lot of film and photos where even though the astronauts are in Shadow they're lit extremely well now in the movies the sum would be called a key light which is your main light and this light in the shadows would be from what's called a fill light but there's no fill light on the moon only a key light the sun there seems to be a  Hollywood lighting technique happening here now you're not going to find any direct evidence of studio lights in any pictures from the Moon NASA is too smart for that but even in big budget movies you can sometimes see the cameras and lights in reflections now look at this in the reflection on the helmet it looks like a neat row of movie lights and look at the reflection on this photo what the heck is that that looks a lot like a studio light with the barn doors open but here's a photo that shows what looks  like a movie prop this rock is labeled with the letter c but the crew forgot to remove the label when they started shooting how about this picture of the landing module do those Hills look like they're miles away or do they look like this was shot on a Sound Stage speaking of those Hills this photo was supposedly taken a few miles away from The Landing module then how come the backgrounds are identical because they use the same backdrop now let's talk about stars on Earth even with our thick atmosphere the  sky looks like this but on the moon with no air the sky is just black shouldn't the sky be full of stars NASA really thought this went through if you're gonna hoax Something In Space the stars are a big problem this is because by using a star map you can not only get the precise location a photo was taken you can even get the precise day and time so they had to get rid of the Stars when you looked up at the sky Could you actually see the stars in the Solar Corona in spite of the glare we were never able to see stars from the  lunar surface or on the daylight Side of the Moon by eye without looking through the Optics I don't recall during the period of time that we were photographing the sonar curl of what what stars we could see [Music] I don't remember seeing any small problem they use stars to help them navigate to the moon the astronaut Navigator finds a known star in the wide angle telescope using a fingertip control he changes the attitude of the spacecraft to bring the star into line once he has the star in position in the telescope he moves the  optical Sextant he lines The Sexton up with the star and makes a reading so are there stars or not which is it there's a lot of evidence stacking up that doesn't look good for NASA or the moon landing and we're just warming up foreign the government fake the moon landing was basically it was technically impossible to do it and they simply had to come up with some sort of alternative that they felt the public would believe I believe had they wanted to that NASA could indeed have pulled off the greatest hoax  of all time never sent anyone to the moon and recreated in a television Studio can you realize that we that you and I that all of us have actually begun the exploration of another world the United States Geological Survey decided to fill the model of one part of the lunar surface in an area accessible to present research centers four three two one fire reflections of studio lights accidental movie props repeating backdrops there's a lot of evidence suggesting that the moon landing wasn't filmed on the moon  but on a Sound Stage the lunar module engine puts out 3 000 pounds of thrust and the lunar surface is covered with dust that was described as fine powder if that's true why did the engine leave no mark on the surface and shouldn't there be dust everywhere even the foot pads are clean and shiny so either the landing module was sitting there or it was gently lowered down by a crane and you'd have to lower the thing gently look at it it looks like tin foil and curtain rods held together by duct tape  more evidence that a crane was used is when the astronauts separate from the module and return to orbit for pickup look at this the module separates and the astronauts gently lift back to orbit and look how slowly it moves where's the rocket plume from the engine what's allowing this to fly all the way to orbit if you watch the footage closely it looks like the object is wobbling a little on cables or wires by the way who shot this footage there was no camera remote control but somehow the scene is framed perfectly  they're zooming in and out the camera tracks the object up into the sky but conveniently loses the object when it gets too high but the camera does pan around the surface who's working the camera now speaking of cables and wires look at this footage does this look natural or does it look like he's being lifted by wires Apollo 11 this is Houston uh go ahead [Music] about all we can see from here okay and uh reference to your question on this uh Step 13 on the decal uh I understand that you get used up uh  I've been repress O2 package and at that time instead of being then there's this footage of Neil and Buzz putting up the American flag but if they were both on the moon's surface who's shooting the footage and how is the flag waving if there's no atmosphere on the moon now sure we've been told that there was an aluminum tube holding up the flag but it seems to be moving around a lot now here's a picture of what an Apollo astronaut spacesuit looked like but look at the soles of the shoes they don't look anything like the  footprints the astronauts supposedly made in the lunar dust and what about the heat the surface temperature on the Moon during the day is over 250 degrees Fahrenheit that's as hot as an oven the film inside their cameras should have melted but there are thousands of pictures that all came out perfectly fine well fine except for the whole wrong Shadows no stars movie props visible lights and stuff being hoisted by cranes right except for that and there are plenty of photos that are flat out doctored if you remember our episode  on NASA's Mars cover-up we proved that the photos of Mars were altered before being released to the public this is a technique perfected during Apollo the Apollo handheld cameras had special crosshairs on them called her soul marks and these were here to help make sure the photos were printed properly from the negatives and not distorted and to make it easier to stitch photos together for panoramas but in some of the photos the crosshairs aren't there or are only in part of the picture in other  photographs objects appear in front of the crosshairs now that's physically impossible unless the objects were added after the photo was taken by layering them on top of empty backgrounds and there are even more problems with the photography here's a picture of an Apollo astronaut saluting the American flag but look at his feet the Shadows don't even reach them it's like he was edited in later and somebody forgot to add a shadow now even if we could explain all these anomalies in the photos there's a big reason why nobody can get  to the moon a reason why human beings can't leave Earth at all at least not yet the reason is real and scientifically proven as fact radiation we see the ascent stage suddenly pop up without any exhaust plume whatsoever as though it were jerked up by a cable I research suggests that images of the Apollo Landings are not a true and accurate record in our view the Apollo pictures were faint many of the images are replete with inconsistencies and anomalies there are problems with almost every aspect of the visual records equipment  and technology used to supposedly put a man on the moon but there's one even bigger problem we haven't dealt with yet there's no way the astronauts could have even escaped Earth's orbit much less gone to the moon and back radiation in 1958 scientist James Van Allen discovered two enormous belts of high energy radiation surrounding the planet the Van Allen radiation belts are a pair of toroidal belts donut-shaped pair of donut-shaped belts of high energy particles any object leaving the Earth's orbit to visit the moon or  Beyond has to pass through them and they extend out about 37 000 miles from Earth these two radiation belts have different compositions the Inner Belt above the equator contains energetic particles that are charged up to a hundred million electron volts the outer belt is electron plasma from the sun's solar wind and has energies in the 10 million electron volt range when it was first detected the strength of the radiation was so powerful that scientists thought they had recorded a Soviet nuclear test  these high energy particles can penetrate spacecraft damaged instruments and are lethal to astronauts but we have photos and even film of the earth taken from much farther out how could this be faked well the astronauts never left low earth orbit from there the Earth fills the entire window of The Craft we only have one window that has a view of the earth and it's build up with the TV camera so uh so to get this film of the earth they blocked out sections of the window this film is an outtake the astronauts didn't  realize they were still rolling they said the camera was pressed up against the window to get a good shot of the Earth but that's not true you can see someone pass in front of the window then quickly jump out of the way and here you see the dim work light that was used so they could operate the camera we're not supposed to see this we're also not supposed to see this someone adjusting the insert that controls the shape of the Earth now remember they're in low earth orbits so the Earth is actually really bright  and fills the whole window how do we know because when they open up the iris of the lens we can see it holy yeah we can't pass through the Van Allen belts yet don't take my word for it take nasus as we get further away from Earth we'll pass through the Van Allen Bells an area of dangerous radiation radiation like this could harm the guidance systems onboard computers or other electronics on Orion but Orion has protection shielding will be put to the test as the vehicle cuts through the waves of  radiation sensors aboard will record radiation levels for scientists to study we must solve these challenges before we send people through this region of space I guess we're still working on solving this issue because I thought we we're also really pushing the boundaries in terms of where we're going forward with exploration I think humans are naturally driven to do this and this is really the beginning I think of human beings leaving low earth orbit I certainly plan on being around to see that I don't want  to be a jerk because she seems like a nice girl but newsflash the Moon is way outside low earth orbit uh the plan that NASA has is to build a rocket called SLS which is a heavy lift rocket it's not is that is much bigger than what we have today able to launch the Orion capsule with human as well as Landers or other components to be to destinations beyond Earth orbit right now we only can fly in Earth orbit that's the farthest that we can go and we only can fly in Earth orbit that's the farthest that we can go and this new  system that we're building is going to allow us to go beyond and hopefully take humans into the solar system to explore so the Moon Mars asteroids there's a lot of destinations that we could go to building block component [Music] once we travel Beyond low earth orbit the crew will be exposed to larger amounts of radiation so we have to design both the crew Protection Systems and our electronic systems to withstand this radiation but didn't we already design those protection systems for Apollo why don't we just use that  technology I'd go to the moon in a nanosecond the problem is we don't have the technology to do that anymore we used to but we destroyed that technology and it's a painful process to build it back again wait we destroyed the technology and we can't recreate it so nobody wrote anything down that seems irresponsible well you mean irresponsible like recording over the original moon landing tapes yeah NASA did that there are no original high quality moon landing tapes they were erased and reused allegedly  was taken in a very strange way NASA took a video feed from the Moon and projected it onto a screen the TV stations pointed their cameras at the screen the stations wanted a direct feed but NASA refused that's why the moon landing footage is such a mess anyway the best way to protect a fragile human body from Ben Allen radiation is lead shielding but even a thin layer of lead would have made the Saturn V rocket too heavy to get off the ground the only protection they had was a thin sheet of aluminum but aluminum melts at about  1200 degrees Fahrenheit the electrons in the van Allen belts have energies of millions of volts now this would equate to a temperature of about 10 million degrees Kelvin so how did NASA overcome this problem they didn't instead they called Hollywood [Music] I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal before this decade is out of Landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the Earth no single Space Project in this period will be more impressive to mankind or more important for the long-range  exploration of space but right now we need a 10 to 12 year program that has as its ultimate goal the man domination of space and if we don't we're going to be in trouble uh to put people on the moon and with enough fuel to enable them to return safely home to us requires is still larger and more powerful rocket however a member of Congress said today that he was tired of being saying the United States second to Russia in a space field and only the future will tell whether we'll manage to close that Gap it's going to take some  time and I think we have to recognize they secured these large boosters which have led to their being first and Sputnik and led to their first uh putting their man in space we are I hope going to be able to uh carry out our efforts with due regard to the problem of the life of the man involved this year but we are behind we are behind y'all behind Kubrick's Odyssey is a short film created by Jay Widener in 2011. recently it gained attention after being picked up by the Gaia streaming Network this  film is the primary reference for the theory that Stanley Kubrick filmed the moon landing footage for NASA in the 1960s and 70s by 1964 NASA knew that sending men to the moon was impossible the deadly radiation belts issues with chemical rockets and weight and radiation shielding issues it made it unachievable Kubrick became involved when someone in the Pentagon saw his 1963 film Dr Strangelove impressed by the special effects this person offered Kubrick a secret project faking the Apollo moon landings Kubrick was  persuaded using a carrot and stick approach if he helped fake The Landings he would have artistic freedom and financial support for his future films that's the carrot the stick was blackmail no one knows how the powers that be convinced Kubrick to direct the Apollo Landings maybe they had compromised Kubrick in some way the fact that his brother Raul Kubrick was the head of the American Communist Party may have been one of the Avenues pursued by the government to get Stanley to cooperate so a deal was made in 1964. Kubrick was  given three years to complete 2001. in order to test the filmmaking technology necessary to make the moon landings appear believable to a system he had access to several NASA experts and the use of a special 50 millimeter lens made specifically for the Apollo program originally was a lens manufactured design developed and manufactured by Zeiss for NASA so how did he do it without the use of CGI Kubrick perfected a new kind of visual effect called front screen projection experimentation with front screen projection began in 1949  shortly after the invention of scotchlight a material used for screens in movie theaters Scotch light is cloth embedded with millions of tiny glass beads that have high reflectivity due to the sensitivity of scotch light a minimal amount of light is required this means that actors can stand in front of the projection without it being visible on their bodies or clothing front screen projection was so convincing that many people think the dawn of man sequences in 2001 were actually shot on location  they weren't almost all that part of 2001 was shot in a studio with actors on sets if you look closely at Apollo photographs of the Moon you can see a line where the fake moon set ends and the front projection screen begins at that line the texture of the lunar surface changes dramatically please note how everything is in focus from the rocks and Pebbles close to the camera all the way to the Crystal Clear Mountain behind the astronaut there is a stark difference in ground texture between the set and what is being  projected onto the screen you can almost count the number of small rocks and the granularity of the ground that is clearly seen on the set once we get to the screen on the other side of my line This granularity disappears The Little Pebbles and dust just seem to disappear behind my line the latter part of Kubrick's Odyssey discusses the hidden messages in The Shining that Kubrick directed in 1980. Kubrick leaves clues that he faked the moon landings the characters Jack and Danny who are the father and son in the  movie symbolize different aspects of Kubrick's own personality Danny the child represents Kubrick's inner innocence while Jack represents the jaded and morally compromised adult that Kubrick has become there are also specific visual Clues the Indian wall hangings on the walls of the Overlook Hotel look like rockets launching into space the pattern on the carpet of the hotel is a hexagonal shape that represents the shape of the launch pads at Cape Canaveral and in one scene when Dany is playing with his toys on this  carpet he stands up and is seen wearing a sweater that says Apollo 11 on it next there's a scene where Dany then walks down the hall and finds an open door to a room the room is number 237 which was changed from Room 217 in the same King novel the number 237 is significant because the average orbital distance between the Earth and the moon is 237 000 miles then there's the scene where Jack's wife discovers that he's been typing the same phrase over and over the phrases all work and no play makes Jack  a Dull Boy but the word all isn't a-l-l it's actually typed out as a11 or Apollo 11. and there are a lot of other claims made by Kubrick's Odyssey but those are the highlights and these claims were highly debated and very controversial what we need is Kubrick admitting he faked the moon landing we need to hear it from his own mouth but he never said a word about it or Kitty [Music] we've been brought in here by Stanley Kubrick to more or less ensure the scientific Integrity of the film to make sure that it's uh very very close in  reality but still we want to make sure that it has a base of reality we're in the final Assembly Building of the land Santa cubic and I have set ourselves several objectives we hope to convey to the public the Wonder and beauty and promise of the Age of Exploration which which is opening up before the human race [Music] good evening I'm sorry not to be able to be with you tonight in 2016 an interview with Stanley Kubrick was found and according to the video Kubrick had to sign an 88-page non-disclosure agreement that the  interview would stay hidden for 15 years [Music] is everything look in order regarding our contract and the 15-year agreement and assigned the non-disclosure is that that's all for the legal stuff right yeah okay looks good to me all right a documentary filmmaker interviews Stanley Kubrick about his career as a director and right from the start Kubrick interrupts and explains that when he initially considered the project he saw it as just another film when asked which of his movies he's referring  to he reveals that he's talking about the moon landing and claims that it was all fake challenge of making this this film and and I went into it like it was a regular film like a a another production of mine um not thinking too much about uh the long-term effects the the what it would mean uh to to society if ever if it was ever discovered um but what are you talking about how do you know what you're talking about you're referring to something the fake moon landing he says that he was approached by NASA  and that they appealed to his sense of Duty and patriotism but Cooper admitted that the project was about America's Public Image and upstaging Russia to fulfill this dream that America has had as a country since the Kennedy years okay so you're saying the motivation was PR PR absolutely plain simple PR then he goes on to confirm that the conspiracy is actually the truth fake faking the exploration of space because there was just no way we could get there NASA then set up a meeting with Kubrick and president Richard Nixon Kubrick met  with Nixon in the Oval Office and details what Nixon asked him to do film a fake moon landing I am convinced and the gentleman at Nasa are also convinced that you can help us make people believe that we have been to the Moon this interview was a bombshell this was the evidence the world had been waiting for this was evidence that every allegation made in the documentary Kubrick's Odyssey was true yep millions of people saw this interview and finally felt justified in their suspicion that the moon landing never happened yep one  small problem no no that wasn't Stanley Kubrick the Stanley Kubrick moon landing confession set the conspiracy side of the internet on fire but it was a hoax this is either a filmmaker and an actor or more likely two guys goofing around in the full-length version of the interview an agitated producer constantly Badgers the actor whose real name is Tom a launch pad accident n67 which kill Tom you're going to tell me a story so next to sat me down the Oval Office and he says to me you know that boy just I don't think this is how I  want you when we're never going to need help we're going to the deal yeah well the plan he didn't yeah so he says to me that if you don't say he said anything you say what he says okay Tom I'm just giving you a question you want me everything about it yo I walked in and he said that's him you don't have to imitate him but you have to say he says Stanley we're working on this move forward come on get with it Tom do your do a get in the fact that you're writing this time and now he's got to be grab it can be funny in in a  very subtle way so you meet with Nixon and what happened in action what they what they believed was if we mix in sat down caller tell me a story time so Stanley Kubrick had nothing to do with that interview not just that he had nothing to do with the moon landing in the documentary Kubrick's Odyssey everything can be explained all the photo evidence presented is from extremely low resolution photos probably grabbed from the web now unfortunately for the documentary but lucky for us high resolution photos can be found  easily so when looking at a low resolution photo of the lunar landscape you can maybe see a separation between the foreground and the supposed backdrop but in the high-res photos the line isn't there all the other claims in the documentary that refer to photos can be explained simply by looking at the originals as far as the clues left in The Shining those are nothing but coincidences and stretches of the imagination the rockets in the tapestry I don't really see it the hexagonal rug well the launch pad at  Cape Canaveral is not a hexagon it was roughly 10 sides but it's not very symmetrical room 237 is just room 237. the moon isn't 237 000 miles away from the earth it's closer to 239 000 but very slightly Danny is indeed wearing an Apollo 11 sweater but Stanley Kubrick was a space nut he loved the Apollo program and he loved sci-fi and Stanley Kubrick's brother Paul who is the leader of the Communist Party well that's not true at all Kubrick didn't have a brother so that documentary is debunked well maybe debunked maybe not no it's  debunked it is agree yeah but there's still a lot of stuff in those pictures that looks really fishy well that's true the big one is that the Shadows should be parallel since the Shadows are not parallel there must be other light sources except Shadows aren't parallel the direction of Shadows depends on the perspective of the viewer now here's an example on Earth these are two pictures of the same woman taken at different angles in the first photo taken from the side the Shadows are parallel but when  we put our back to the Sun the Shadows aren't even close to parallel in perspective drawing and design parallel lines converge in what's called a vanishing point this is typically the horizon line where objects vanish beyond our field of view plus the astronauts used very wide lenses to capture as much terrain as possible so images are going to be slightly distorted like a carnival mirror but even with a flatter lens or the human eye shadows are not parallel also multiple light sources would cast  multiple Shadows but the objects on the moon cast only one Shadow yeah but every there is no there is is the moon itself the soil on the surface of the Moon is full of tiny beads of Glass and Metal like aluminum and titanium these are all highly reflective materials so the moon soil actually acts like trillions of tiny mirrors bouncing the light back and filling in the shadows we'll ever go skiing on a sunny day of course I have I was an instructor in college you were I don't want to get into that now anyway  you can get a pretty bad sunburn skiing not from the Sun overhead but by the sun reflecting off the snow you could actually burn your cornea with reflected ultraviolet sunlight it's called snow blindness so shadows and multiple light sources bats all debunked now the same background Theory might be my favorite because it really defies explanation until we look more closely oh the backgrounds do not line up perfectly they're slightly off because the photos were taken pretty far apart the hills in  the distance look the same because they're the same those Hills are miles away but since there's no atmosphere on the moon well since there's no water vapor on the moon okay there's an atmosphere on the moon but it's extremely thin compared to the earth it's called an exosphere and it's made up of very small amounts of hydrogen helium and a few Trace gases and because there's no atmosphere there's no Haze we evolved on Earth with a thick atmosphere and one of the ways we determine distant objects is by how hazy they are in other  words how much of the atmosphere are we looking through now on the moon without Haze objects both near and far will feel close it's an optical illusion yeah but where the Stars right the stars are there you just can't see them they're likely story in order to take pictures of the Moon the camera's Iris had to be almost completely closed and shutter speed turned way up this is to let in as little light as possible otherwise the brightness of the Moon would wash everything out look how bright a full  moon is on a clear night a full moon lights up everything and it's a quarter Million Miles Away the astronauts are standing on that it's bright even on Earth if you're standing under a big Spotlight at night you're not going to see stars the iris of your eye acts like the iris of a camera the faint light of the Stars just doesn't register watch a baseball game played Under The Lights You Don't See Stars a lot of moon hoax evidence is cherry-picked like the lack of a blast crater under the lunar module there's no  crater because the engine was turned off about 10 feet from the surface the limb just dropped the rest of the way and without any wind to disturb there's just not going to be a lot of dust flying around and where Apollo 11 touchdown the ground was hard soil but other Apollo Landings like Apollo 12 were pretty dusty the lack of wind is also why the American flag doesn't move well well the aluminum rods are pretty springy so the flag moves for quite a while after it's touched but when it settles down it  doesn't move an inch oh the camera that recorded the lunar module separating that was operated remotely the Footprints don't match because the astronauts put on boot covers that have a different tread on the moon but without an atmosphere to conduct heat there is no convection as long as things are colored bright white they reflect most of the sun's energy pretty well heat wasn't an issue not for the astronauts and not for the camera film now there are many more examples but I think you get the idea every single one  of those pieces of evidence can be explained but hold on a second go on two questions did NASA put men on the moon probably is NASA covering something up on the moon definitely my name is Carl wolf and I was a Precision Electronics photographic repairman with a top secret crypto clearance in mid-1965 I was loaned to the lunar orbiter project at Nasa on Langley field I was taken into the laboratory where the equipment was malfunctioning I couldn't repair it in the dark I asked to have it removed a  Airman second class was in the dark room at that time I was also an Airman second class about 30 minutes into the process he said to me um in a very distressed way by the way we've discovered a base on the back side of the moon and then he proceeded to put photographs down in front of me and clearly in these photographs were structures mushroom-shaped buildings spherical buildings and Towers and at that point I was very concerned because I knew we were working on compartmentalized security he had  breached security and I was actually frightened at that moment and I did not question him any further and a few moments later someone did come into the room um I worked there for three more days and I remember going home and naively thinking I can't wait to hear about this on the evening news and here it is more than 30 years later and I hope we hear about it tonight and I will testify under oath before Congress that what I'm saying is the truth [Applause] I think the reason we haven't returned  to the moon for 50 years is not because of a lack of Interest or funding or the Van Allen radiation belts I think we haven't gone back to the Moon because of what was found up there but that requires its own episode and if you want to see it let me know whatever is up there has been up there for a long long time and I think we can prove it [Music] thank you so much for hanging out with me today my name is AJ that tacklefish this has

S62	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsMnWztm2ok	I'm going to be ruining a Roblox scam I'm going to explain what these scammers are doing expose their strategy and finally I'm going to completely annihilate their scam by spamming the crap out of them and then also deleting their system entirely now to start it's like almost every single Discord scam on the planet some random person contacts you and this person says hello I am contacting you about your ban at Fashion famous now fashion famous is yes a very hit Roblox game it is almost as captivating as Roblox paintball can I  spend many hours on it but anyways I've been removed from this community for scamming or account theft now here's the thing I never play fashion famous on this Discord account in fact I hide it in a little secret account in shame so there would be no possible way that I would actually scam someone and this doesn't make any sense to me so I tell Good Old Ben here that I'm not the scammer this is complete horse crap but Ben is not backing down really well we're gonna have to post an announcement about you scamming people and you're  gonna get banned from every single server you're in and my heart dropped I do not want this I want to make sure that I I can appeal this and of course Ben is very kind and provides an invite link that I can use but I'm no idiot and I said how can I trust that you guys are the true fashion famous could I see some proof with this and Ben sends me a Roblox group link to Fashion famous now I open up this link and my heart drops a little bit I noticed that this is the real fashion famous group they have one  million members I go down to experiences and that is the fashion famous that I spend many of my hours on but if I go back to the group they have a Discord server if I right click and just copy the link of this Discord server and I paste it into a random server you'll notice this is the same fashion famous server I am in a lot of trouble however my brain activates again and I realize that maybe I should take another look at this fashion famous group and just go to the fashion famous game maybe they have  a Discord server link that I can look at so I scroll down and I notice they have join our channels and this is a Discord invite link so I copy the link address and I put it back in a Discord and there's two different servers now to explain what's going on a lot of people think that at this Roblox group the original one that I've joined from the scammers has been hacked but what has really happened is that someone stole their invite link now to show you how this works I'm going to go to my Discord  server and as you can tell this invite link is in the description of every single one of my videos so I'm going to copy this invite code and if I paste this invite link into this little tool you can see that there is the no text-to-speech Discord server and the main important thing is that there's this invite Creator now if I put in a vanity link so my Discord server's vanity link is just NTTS you'll notice that it doesn't tell me who is the person that made the invite so using this we can figure out which one of  these servers is the real server and which one might have a vanity link so I'm going to copy the smaller fashion famous server and I paste it into the little tool and it shows that this was an invite created by someone and if I copy the link of the scam server you might already know what's about to happen I paste in the link and you notice that there is no person that created the invite in fact this is a vanity link now what has happened is that on this Roblox group there is that normal Discord invite link however  someone made a mistake because this invite link wasn't permanent when you create a normal Discord invite you actually have a couple options you can select between 30 minutes up to 7 days for your invite or unlimited if you don't have it as unlimited these invite links will expire but despite the link being invalid it is still available on the group page and these scammers saw that and made their Discord vanity link the same as this invite link now of course doing something like this gives them a lot of credibility because it is  the official group and it shows their scam Discord server but the thing is is that not a lot of people notice that so the scam continues on I ask could I see some proof of me scamming someone and they show me this screenshot of course Ben is extremely helpful in this case and you can see this Discord screenshot basically I messaged someone and asked them to moderate for my group and I send them a roblox.com groups link obviously this is a fake Roblox link and it seems like they get hacked and I say lol effing idiot thanks for  the accounts and apparently I dropped the n-word for some reason and this is completely absurd these aren't my messages I didn't scam this person in fact I don't even know this person so I tried pleading my case this might just be someone trying to frame me or impersonate me and Ben always trying to reassure me here by saying probably I mean we've had many people trying to frame famous developers and this Strokes my ego a little bit of course I'm a famous developer and Ben tells me that I should still file an appeal so that I  can clear my name and make sure it isn't me and of course I decide to continue on with the appeal so I get invited to a support group chat now I should make it clear this is someone else that's actually scam baiting these guys I'm just keeping their name Anonymous and saying it's me just for the comedic Factor okay so I joined the support Channel and I'm pleading my innocence I mean I'm giving them Pages upon pages of proof that this isn't me I mean how can I prove myself and I have this new character named valky who says do you  mind screen mean sharing the DMS with this user so of course I opened up my little Discord I go to my direct messages but as you can tell in my DMs there's absolutely nothing I mean Discord telling me that I've been breaking the terms of service by being in a bad server but my innocent should be clear but that's not enough for Good Old Ben to prove my innocence so what they tell me to do is just open up Roblox and I'm still screen sharing showing my screen it's basically like you guys are the scammers right now you  could see their perspective and as you can tell I'm in my Roblox account asdk-o-p-u-o-d-f- letters Ben is saying that this is all good and they're basically just asking because once again it's a group chat there's multiple people talking and they're just trying to make sure that I have ownership to the account and that I just didn't hack this account yesterday or something they then asked me to turn off my pin because I have two-factor authentication enabled I am a security genius so they tell me  to turn it off and why would I ever need to turn off two-factor authentication to show you that this is my account I mean I open it up look at it this is definitely a legitimate account of mine now in terms of the psychology of what's going on Ben basically tries to reassure me that well we know what we're doing so I should feel more comfortable giving out this information but this is not enough and Ben decides to also invest in a different type of psychological Terror which is I hope you understand that if  we have any problems with this ownership verification I will have to report this to the owner of fashion famous my favorite game near and dear to my heart who will then report it to other servers about this developer me scamming and this is bad and all they're trying to do is just raise awareness against scamming including our server now this raise awareness against scamming is a psychological tool that scammers use often basically if they're against scamming then they're trustworthy right they would never ever scam you if  they're against scamming and of course it's pretty obvious that they were completely lying about that now I'm still dragging my feet and telling Ben I don't want to change my Roblox account stuff it's just not safe and Ben decides to go from getting my trust to putting on the pressure by saying sorry but do you want the owner of fashion famous in this group chat threatening me and when that wasn't enough Ben goes the extra mile by saying if the person really did get hacks from you we will have to  report it to the owner and they are actually friends with a Roblox admin which can instantly terminate that account just so that we can make sure no one else gets scammed or anything so now they're making these threats of my Roblox account getting terminated Real by adding in the actual owner of the game now if I Join This Server which I I can't on my alt account because I got banned for some reason well whoever would have figured out why you might notice that there is the Ben character that we've been hearing from very often  and their user ID is right here just Discord keep in mind this is the user ID of the scammer and this is their account and we have this pixelated candy person and here's their user ID and is this the real pixelated candy account well the person that sent me all this information actually found the real pixelated candy account and it's this here obviously two completely different accounts now back to the scam support group chat I basically say instead of asking me to change the settings of an account with  more than 300 000 Robux which is about a thousand dollars which is quite a fair chunk of money instead of asking me to do all that stuff why can't you guys just listen to my advice but Ben pulls out another little trick here saying you realize a developer with over 30 million Robux which is about a hundred thousand dollars has done the same process we're pretty much used to it now Ben here is once again providing reassurance by saying we've done this already you shouldn't be worried this is completely  normal and when things don't go the scammer's way they pull out the big guns they get that pixelated candy account which is impersonating the developer or the owner but they're saying that you don't want to confirm the ownership so if that's the case I'll need to report this to a Roblox admin and let them know about it now once again this is just them putting on pressure to try and force me to go through their whole entire scam and I just gotta say it those eyes reassure me eyes are a window into a person's soul and this soul is  pure and gorgeous oh wait I already have an anime girlfriend anyways I cave in and I open up Roblox and I deactivate my pin now keep in mind during this whole entire Fiasco they're telling me to screen share my screen so I'm going through my settings I'm going into my account and I disable two-factor authentication and all this stuff now of course this isn't enough information for the scammers to actually take my account so they need more info so what they tell me is that they just want me to look at  my email account and just check to see if there's any Roblox emails and they now have access to what your email address is that whole screen sharing bit was just to get this email address and make sure you're following the scam now what can happen here is that they either ask you to send yourself a Roblox email or they'll do it themselves on their own computer so on their end they confirm that they can see this email and they need to make sure that it's the official Roblox email so what they want me to do  is they want me to copy the email and send the link here so they want me to copy this reset password link and then send it to them now most people at this point would get cold feet realize this is a scam and stop but these scammers know that's a possible way that this scam could end so what they do is they say is that link safe so I get confused with that link they're asking if the Link's safe I mean of course it's safe how can I tell that this is a safe Roblox link and they tell me to visit trustcentury.org and this website checks  if the site is fraud so I need to copy the link and put it into the fraud detector and to be honest this website looks pretty legitimate I mean it's it's I mean it looks pretty good right there's a lot of stuff that's going on they have privacy policies all this stuff so maybe the link I got from Roblox wasn't safe so I just need to enter in the URL now before I click scan website I'm actually going to open up a couple of chrome Tools in fact I'm going to open up my network Tab and I'm going to make sure that I am recording because  we need to figure out what this fraud detector is doing so if I click scan website it's going to do a couple things now I paused recording and the website's still going to go through and like refresh stuff it's going to be annoying I think I actually did put in my real Roblox account but if I crack this bad boy up a little bit on the left here you'll notice that the website refreshed and it says roblox.com zero detections everything is all good but on the network side here if I open this up you'll notice that we have two events  and this event here if I open it up it sends a payload to the request URL of discord.com API slash web hooks now a web Hook is basically a link where if you send information to this webhook it will send a message in a Discord Channel and just to make that really clear I went on Disco hook and I could type in whatever the heck I want all these letters if I press on send what it does is it actually sends a message to whatever server I have it pointed to and has to be my own server obviously you know security reasons but what's  happening on this website is that they are sending in a payload to this web Hook and the payload if I open up the embed and open it all the way it is sending in your Roblox reset password link so this is basically like this web hook sending in your password reset link to some random server that these scammers have where they can then open up this link and they can reset this password in fact this one is already expired probably because uh my account got hacked or something I don't know now how does this website look so gosh darn  legitimate well if we scroll down and we just look at some of their privacy policy we open this bad boy up you might notice that it says urlvoid.com and if we open up URL void I'll just copy it over this bad boy well notice that this is the actual website that they're trying to impersonate and fish from so URL void you could put in whatever the heck you want scan website all good to gozies but with these guys oh you're gonna lose your Roblox account now the funny thing about web hooks is that all  you need is the URL to send a message and of course I mean why would you want to look at reset password links when for example you could be sent a whole bunch of fortnite thanos's saying pinging at everyone I just Thanos snapped your web hook consider this El Bozo and it has uh gifs of fortnite dancing from Thanos that'd be hilarious if I sent them this and in fact I think that's exactly what I'm gonna do I'm gonna go back to disco hook I'm not going to send them my Roblox password no I'm gonna send them  an everyone ping and Thanos dancing and I click Send my finger slipped and I clicked send again my finger slipped one more time oh it slipped oh oh oh my fingers clicking stop clicking fingers stop doing this this this is bad stop sending this ping this is awful this is extremely bad oh no Heavens at the end of the day this is not what you actually want to do the best thing to do is actually delete their web hook and if you want to do this yourself there's a website it's webhooks.scam.gay I know quite the name  but you paste in a web hook and you click delete and what will happen is that that web hook will no longer work so that means that if someone Falls for this scam and sends in the reset password link it will not be sent to their web hook because their web Hook is deleted it doesn't exist anymore and it sabotages their system now of course deleting their web hook just doesn't solve the whole entire issue so what I decided to do is I just copy their little URL and then you go to who is and you figure out what the domain registrar  is and you just go on their little website and you report abuse and within a couple days this website will be bye-byed oh wonderful and that's how you fully stop the scam at least for that website you get it taken down by the registrar anyways I'm gonna go fill out this report abuse form and uh we'll see if that website stays up for any longer than it should bye bye I love you [Music] 	Liberal			Liberal	216
S70	https://youtu.be/A2xqFvLSCFg?si=GM88wILFiKaWbEUz	wait for her. Get ready this hour of closing arguments starts right now. >> I'm Vinnie Paul Dunne thank you for joining here in closing arguments so things are going to get a little graphic here. I will try my best to tip toe around some of the phraseology that I have to use here. But we're talking about the allegations associated with this hip hop. >> Mogul billionaire Sean diddy Combs and. >> You know you think about the name. >> How long he's. Been rich and powerful and famous and such a huge part of.  Hip hop culture and pop culture. What we're talking about now it's it's quite shocking. It really is. People are talking about in the same breath. As like Jeffrey Epstein at this point based upon allegations that he denies. And they have not been proven. Now we know that he's homes were raided. A federal sex trafficking investigation and it was you know a couple guys showing up. Can we see your phone knows me. Large numbers of people a show of force military-style vehicles ripping through. Everything in  his home in La and one of his homes down on Miami's star Island. Now tmz obtained images of the aftermath of the raid at diddy's la mansion. And here. You can say they tore the place apart. Anywhere and everywhere, and it seems like they're very focused on. Electronic devices and then anywhere where a hard drive or a thumb drive could be found. This is a real search and they sees things there they are going in taking the servers and the hard drives. I refer this stuff out. It's a real investigation like  this isn't like. Let's let's take a quick look see if we can find something. You know it's just you know kinda cover our bases here because you know someone was complaining is a serious investigation. Absolutely series when I asked R Kelly's lawyer last night how serious he thinks this is 0 to 10. He said 12 seed Greenberg said 12. We know very little about the federal investigation except that it comes on the heels of a couple of civil. Complaints that were filed against did. The first one by Cassandra Ventura  Cassie. Someone who spent 11 years I guess on and off with diddy there are they were thing there were a couple there. They are. She filed this suit the next day things were settled and we don't know the details of the settlement. But we do know the details of the complaint. You're ready. I warned you already I'm going to try to dance around some of the language if I have to hear but. Here in the complaint, she describes these things called freak offs okay the first time Mister Combs higher demand and  brought the man to his home in Los Angeles plus the man Mister Combs and his Ventura war masquerade masks and in just a drugs Mister Combs directed MS. Mentor to perform sexual acts with this man while Mister Combs watch them. He pledged himself while he directed MS. Venture and the man to do specific acts. Lasted multiple days. Mister Combs begin to call this arrangement a freak off or f o. His mentor was eventually instructed to use Web sites and escort services to find male sex workers to participate in  foes Mister Combs told Mister insurers to search sometimes Mister Combs with paid to fly the male sex workers to his location. Mister Combs always supplied MS. Ventura and the sex worker with copious amounts of drugs before during foes, MS. Ventura was given ecstasy cocaine GHB ketamine marijuana and alcohol in excess of amounts. During foes which allowed her to disassociate during these horrific encounters, it became commonplace to get IV fluids in the days after an effort to recover from the excesses  substances push up on her. During foes in addition to directing his mentor and pleasuring himself Mister Combs would use his phone laptop and tablet to film is Ventura having sex with the hired sex worker. He treated the forced encounter as a personal art project, just in the candles to use for lightning to frame the video those that he took. All right, that's a sample of that complaint she filed the complaint settled the next day. She had been with him for 11 years so. Are they investigating this.  It's there's videos I don't know. She's of age he's of age arguably consensual she saying it's not but its on video what is the video tell us now. The subsequent lawsuit filed by Rodney Smith known as Little Rock and work for diddy as a producer and perhaps did other things and a little raw describes sex parties that have taken did he had sex workers and endless drugs flowing through the recording sessions that. CRS the recording studio Mister Combs homes and on the yacht. According to Mister Jones Mister Combs felt there  was too much testosterone in the studio, unwanted sex workers there to create the 5 for the love album. Then these workers arrived and Mister Jones in the other musicians and producers were required to engage in sex acts with them. In addition to sex workers there were at least 5 women in the crowd who were under the age of 16. Here we go now this this it could be what we're talking about in terms of a federal investigation. According to Mister Jones Mister Combs forced all the women to drink laced. A daily  on the liquor. Upon information belief, Mister Combs lace the liquor with ecstasy. He attempted to leave him Mister Combs forced him to stay Mister Jones. Now let's let's. Move them or step further and I want to remind you what I said the top that some people are talking about a comparison here between. Billionaire Didion billionaire Jeffrey Epstein and Jeffrey Epstein that is Elaine Maxwell and we know that she took care of him. Including his fee I still can't believe this picture it's bizarre. It's one thing to do  it, but then you're going to photograph of what is that what is wrong with these people too much money too much time what is it. Let's cue a match while she's in prison now because of her role in Epstein's little set up that he had actually is a big set up had his own Island. And that black book that will never say now. Little Rob describes someone named Christine corum. As I described her think about the lane Maxwell. Graham required all employees from the Butler to the chef to the housekeepers to  walk around with a black Prada pouch or Fannie pack filled with cocaine ecstasy and other drugs. Graham ordered sex workers for Mister Combs career and also said Mister Jones to solicit sex workers from Mister Combs when the sex workers arrived at Mister Combs residents defending Graham would negotiate the price and would take them aside, and pay them so she sort of is alleged to have kind of set everything up. The way they Elaine was alleged to set things up for Jeffrey Epstein is this a fair comparison, but I think there  are some comparisons here some slight differences. But they're both really rich really powerful and all of us are very shocked by what we're learning. But I have some questions about all of this we bring in my special guest joining me tonight St. Louis Missouri licensed mental health and Ashley certified clinician sharonda Brown sharonda great to see you I'm a tool. Let's start with the free coughs and. I mean it became part of the bases for she's claiming this was not consensual she's forced into this they're in some sort  of relationship over the course of 11 years. Take us into the mindset of Cassie and why she would hang around that long and and and what this means about what's going on in this relationship, the power and the and the dynamics in the relationship. >> Checking with 19 when she first loss to calm and he was well into his 30 but West and that she was that the young she wasn't Singer she wanted a record deal. So she was looking at that that's what she was looking at what he saw that does not want to take advantage  which is what a lot of credit is due. So what we could see what the outside of they relationship actually paying this predatory relationship based on what she could get issued to start him and I think that over time that became the lead Bridget what do you want this like you want me to make sure that make it easier I think that and I think at some point when you become a victim of sexual abuse, you start to think about all the things they you would lose it did not engage and not just you, but the people around you and  reading the case she was definitely of using she withheld her we'll a lot as well as part France, so there were a lot of allegations in there a report that okay for a reason to stay beside him and it wasn't because she left. >> Okay now, let's let's take a look diddy in these allegations and again he's denying all of this is not any guilt or any. >> Crime or. >> Anything like But if we it is a big if right because nothing's been proven they settled it, we'll never hear the in a courtroom. He's engaging in this kind of  conduct how does he get to that point. >> Getting away with it over and over and having peace who are approving it applauding it even people begin him so long to greet these reports you see that he was along most of the time engaging in the act and I love that thing happened with people in this deal really a lot of power and money and people around them with the silent because they want to savor all a lie. So once you start getting away with it, especially when you've been doing this for allegedly over  20 something years. You become and death aboard the ship believe that you are so this is how these things happen. So of course I'm going to say no I didn't do it I don't have you know and the guilt or anything was it from where the staff people signed in 2 days, they agree to it and what was the weather that forced them or whether he often and something in his mind and what I ship at a social past. My people get into what they wanted to do. >> This Christine occur, AM and the dynamic between her and  diddy and then the dynamic of ghislane Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein are these similar to see them differently. How do you use see the the >> roles and the nature of these relationships. >> I think they're very similar and what you'll find a lot of predators little to fight even men who are very powerful to get other really do have to have other women to convince other women to come to you you have to have someone like-minded needs to convince them that this is OK that the suspect that that is the trust factor that is the  learning factor. You don't want to buy minutes a steamy it's probably not going to be a likely as a woman. Well as likable going to have a moment and this is how they gain the trust they gain the trust for the woman and that is how a lot of these let me get harassed or get into these situations because they're made them believe that they are safe by the likes of a woman so this ad very very common in those type of relationship, no person should have to have to like who is likable it was more to get  in the door of the people to you if you walk into the victim. >> So how does a delay in Maxwell or potentially Christina kerem get into that position and and how do they see themselves. >> Most of the time they started out as victims as well. And found themselves becoming engulfed in the culture and usually they've gotten too much hurts too much money maybe there are things that we have and they're like that easier to the point where they believe it o the person who would ask him to do these things there's a lot of  manipulation that goes on and in the White House, Ali Islam and get involved they definitely could have invested so much and I think getting a lot of things to believe that they all did for some reason or they'll ask think so it starts with making the manipulation and I actually believe that when you get into situations you too we're a victim that first one thing to believe that if the fall. >> And how do you see the relationship between the incredible wealth and the deviant see the sexual deviant  C >> Is it always there does the money because it has the money. Exaggerated what is that relationship. >> I think that when it comes to sexual deviant sexual trauma, most of the time people are very sexual that means that is a human need right. But then we go overboard or less than one has taken that from your thoughts Riley would you want to wait what you There is pleasure and and there are some fire was out and violating others so that's one aspect of it, but when you add money to wait which gives you leverage  it allows other people to say sure will agree with this because you have money sure we will do this but you have money you can make our lives easier so then it becomes a quid pro quo situation or because the situation up you know convenes in which people are saying OK well you know that my life easier all suffer you can make my life easier in so good evening, it wings meaning the predator wing and then the victim police that they are getting enough to feel as well but they become very gritty grimy so  it takes a life of its all that they are very 2 separate entities because people that will put Ray a sexual act or 2, but off actual act in their property. It would be a totally different out. >> Sharon Brown great to have you on the program tonight great great insight. Thank you so much, I'm sorry you had to talk about this but you are an expert in in helping us understand it to a certain extent, thanks so much Ron. >> Thank you all right when we come back what does the think tank think of the free coughs.  Oh my goodness did did you see their expressions duri Welcome back that's the booking photo for a man named Brandon Paul not his best day. He was arrested in Miami on the same day that federal authorities were raiding diddy's home onstar Island in Miami and is one of his other homes in Los Angeles. Brandon Paul, it's a an associate of Sean diddy let's take a look at a picture of him. There is apparently with some drugs got the shades there he is with diddy I believe that's from the Miami The day that he  got arrested. So who is this guy well he's been described as sort of a drug mule for diddy now I don't know if that's true that's the way some people are describing him. He's facing some drug charges in Scripps news, Cleveland tonight has more on who this man is. >> Booking photos of Brandon Paul snapped in a South Florida jail Monday. Our departure from images shared on his public facing facebook profile of life in this sphere of a celebrity miami-dade police arrested the 25 world at the Miami  airport as he was about to board a private jet was Sean diddy Combs officers were working with homeland security when they found cocaine and marijuana least candy in pulls back and both felonies in Florida did he was not arrested the hip-hop mogul and some of his associates including Paul are named in this explosive lawsuit filed by diddy's former producer Rodney Jones, so Jones levels accusations of sex. Well, a soul drug abuse sex, trafficking and other crimes bill Jones and Paul worked on tv's most recent  album which Paul celebrated on social media Inc that amber court documents include some of those social media photos of Colin diddy together the lawsuit labels Paul you look wires and distribute drugs and guns. It also says he provided cash. >> Payments to sex workers and it is behalf. >> One witness describes scene all another spike in Champaign models with ecstasy on a yacht in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Jones alleges did he was running a sex trafficking venture and his associates including homer evening and  abetting it all graduated from Hawkins school and then briefly attended Syracuse University replay basketball is filed their lease in his home town as she can thanks to the was majoring in sports management. We visited the chagrin falls address Lee students polls, current home in arrest records, no one answered the door but someone yelled no comment proving do we also reached out to Paul's attorney who simply said quote we do not plan on trying this case in the media all issues will be dealt with  in the court. The same day Paul was arrested homeland security raided in took evidence from diddy's Miami in Beverly Hills homes. He's denied Jones allegations or the East Ohio beast collaborative to end human trafficking move in on the situation. >> Telling us in a statement quote every time human trafficking is in the news is a reminder that victims are exploited every day it can happen to anyone from anywhere. The connection to Northeast, Ohio in the specific allegations remind us that it happens here too it's  important to focus on is that human trafficking is solvable. >> Right now Paul is scheduled to appear on those criminal charges in Miami in late April in civil court in Jones is asking for at least 30 million dollars in damages against a team in all of his associates in Cleveland Catherine Ross news 5. >> So the question is will the feds now try to flip the mule let's bring our think tank. See what they had to say about all that joining us tonight in Atlanta Georgia couple defense klemmer C joining us in Phoenix  Arizona, the attorney who represented that woman. You know are I'm not going to say their name Kirk Nurmi is with us and in Chapel Hill North Carolina. Chapel Hill, North Carolina president of the West Coast trial lawyers and former federal prosecutor Nima romani are the West Coast lawyers now joining the ACC also home my goodness anyway, all clear I'm going to begin with you do you want to start with the free coughs or flipping the mule. >> Oh my God, I'm this is bad. This is bad. This is. >> Homeland security, I mean  they they investigate terrorism but I do believe that I think it's not going to be as easy as people may think I think that since the settlement with Kasey I think a puffy I'm diddy proudly has been prepared for this I think that it's going to be a lot of lawyering it's going to not going to be easy. I. I it's like a x-rated version of power, this is so entreat I didn't know these things happen. So I mean. >> And that was good he didn't know this was happening is that that you're on the invite list  and you weren't all that good. >> That is a good thing, but he is. >> Like a pillar in like hip-hop. >> Community in the hip-hop spaces and this is like this is major I think this affects. >> Countless careers, countless families, the fact that they're going that everything is relative. Everything is relative so this is this this is going to shake up the music industry like nothing else. He's done. >> Absolutely Kirchner me I want to ask you. Criminal activity if any did you hear in the description of  the sex parties that I went through tonight and the free cost other than the underage like the That crystal clear, but is there as are other other crimes taking place there that that would be subject to this federal investigation or do you think it's a focus on under age sex workers are underage women and underage boys that maybe trafficked into having sex with adults in different not sex, but being abused by adults in different places. >> Well I think the underage children are certainly and obviously rightly so going to  be a big part of any but when you talk about the laundry list if you look at the civil complaint. The laundry list is long. We don't have time into 9 to consider all the possible crimes that we have possession of drugs narcotics we have sexual assaults is your state crimes right we have again perhaps if there were videos taken of these events is some of the civil complaints allege, and you have possession of perhaps and photographs of underage children child pornography you have the possession of drugs.  You have the importing of sex workers which is a federal violent nation. So you got a lot there are many that that again this this onion is going to be peeled if some of the complaints are truly the civil complaint, a lot of this might be on video. I'm sure those agents are pouring through the video now of course as you as your question has been invited but Mister all knows a lot about these things. Mister Paul's 25 years old and he's going to be looking to save his skin and he's going I bet he's  going have a lot to say to authorities is going to sing them a nice song. >> Nima Ahmadi one of the Fed's doing right now your former federal prosecutor they executed these 2 raids. They arrested this man Brandon Paul what are they doing and and how do they figure out if they've got a case here. >> Jason in the Southern District of New York doesn't execute multiple search warrants at the same time get a federal judge to sign off on it. Last advocates they're going to flip. The drug male alleged drug deal they've  already talked to the witnesses and then tell you this I don't in the East Coast now the South the mile or 2 from my house OK that's how close I am to did it. My house isn't as big. But this is big news in La and I noted his lawyer, Aaron Dyer restore together South and personnel that I mean that sex-trafficking production of child pornography these of mandatory minimum sentences, 10 or 15 years sentences so you know the Fed's work they already got those witnesses lineup of tell me it's just a matter  of days if for an indictment is unsealed and did it in others are arrested probably in a sweeping Rico indictment that names all these as predicate acts. >> Do you think there's potentially an indictment already. >> The potentially is an indictment that hasn't been unsealed what agents are doing right now combing through those records you've got your search warrant that's been executed it's going to be returned and there's going to be arrest warrant. So it doesn't matter if it's. It is under indictment now it  will be under indictment very soon and I think they already have the evidence that they need just trying to wrap it up nicely with the digital footprint hoping to find that those videos that Cassie and the other civil plaintiffs have alleged. How incredibly stupid was did he not to settle that case before it went public. We're talking about a difference between 10 30 million dollars which for him it was nothing but she was the catalyst to bring this whole empire down. >> have about 20 seconds here  but do you see a scenario where he ends up like R Kelly ended up where he goes away. We just don't hear from them anymore. >> He will not go against the dying of the light he is going to fight and I think that it's going to be a test to see if corruption is real because I think that he has a lot of information on some. Some pretty powerful people so we're going to see is if things stick we're going to see how much pull did didn't really have. >> Great news think tank with us the rest of the hour up  next. >> The free care. Henry protesters have been showing up to court every time there's a hearing for accused cop killer. Karen Reid now. The da wants the judge to restrict what they can wear when the trial starts. >> Welcome back if you remember last night on this program we talked about how Alec Murdock had fail the polygraph and it was going to a a perhaps cause a huge problem with his federal. >> Plea deal because he needed to be honest and cooperate with federal investigators but they're claiming he failed the  polygraph and was lying about some of the crimes. >> And they're very concerned because there's 6 billion dollars that's unaccounted for this would put in jeopardy is plea deal and perhaps put him in federal prison for so long that even if he got his murder conviction overturned. >> He would never ever ever ever ever. >> Have the chance to see the light of day. Well tonight, defense has struck back in. They said that examiner I was asking a lot of odd questions and talking about that he had just  lie detector on killer you're in Van der sloot. They're saying that this this guy gave an unfair test and the questions are all over the place case they didn't make sense and he was talking about your in Van der sloot so we'll see what the judge does with it it's all happening on Monday. In the meantime it's time to go on the docket. >> This is where the first statement of its kind and what doesn't is that off like this you can turn. The rest of the witnesses in the murder prosecution carried is  absolutely baseless. The idea that multiple police about it the mta's fire personnel. The medical examiner to prom security joy taken in by vast in spirit. We should use and what it is completely contrary to the evidence at a desperate attempt to reassign guilt what has happened to the wind this is someone no actual vote on the case is wrong. >> Has Marcia Norfolk County Massachusetts. Clearly clearly upset with what's happening in his prosecution of accused cop killer carry. This huge outpouring of support for  Karen Reid. >> But you have protesters and blogger and people who are. >> In his eyes, intimidating witnesses in the case this by going to their places of work going to their homes and and using bullhorns and screaming And he's charged a turtle the lead, the movement with witness intimidation will Kerry's been treated like. Started look at the scene this is right outside that. >> Courthouse on the courthouse steps. >> These folks are applauding they're wearing shirts they've got signs supporting an accused  cop killer. It's you've never seen anything like it take a look. According to a new motion obtained by NBC 10 Boston. The Commonwealth has made some unique requests of the court regarding this upcoming trial. The Commonwealth requests an order prohibiting any individual from demonstrating in any manner including carrying signs 4 posters or making statements about the defendant law enforcement the Norfolk County district soft district attorney's office, potential witnesses or the evidence within  500 feet of the Norfolk Superior Court complex they want to create a buffer zone. This is a small town courthouse. There's like 2 courtrooms in there one of them is the historic site going beds at the courtroom. That's where this case will be tried. There's one way in the front door and then there's the door on the other side of the courthouse, I've been they're also asking that the wearing or carrying of papers water bottles tote bag signs buttons pins t-shirts sweatshirts hats or any other attire item that  contains any images or readings. This suggests a favorable or unfavorable opinion of either should be prohibited in any place where the jury might congregate and might see. And they also want to prohibit any individual in the courthouse from wearing any button church or insignia related to the defendant the victim or law enforcement. So the da wants that buffer zone for this trial. Take a listen though to. David you Nettie the attorney for counter Reed who was upset. The prosecutor did in this case and both sides are trying  to make sure they get that fair and impartial jury that doesn't get tainted by anything and then gives a verdict based on only the evidence which is what everyone wants let's take a listen to David unity going after the prosecutor. >> Da morsi went off the rails given unprecedented video statement to the media where he specifically votes for the credibility of Commonwealth witnesses in violation of the rules of Professional responsibility in violation of this court's order. A member of the public.  Issued a public records request and we got this to show all of the media outlets. That morsi made sure received his statement. Before any trial has occurred he called the defense theory in this case call a false narrative before any trial has occurred he announced his opinion that nobody within the home at 34 Fairview participated in any murder or any cover up before any trial. He focused for the credibility of Commonwealth witnesses Jennifer mccabe mask and a cave-in Brian Albert. He announced that  those witnesses were forth coming. In other words, truthful. Before any trial has occurred EA morsi announced that the defense theory is quote a desperate attempt to we assign guilt end quote. >> All right folks final pretrial conference April 12 trial begins April 16 will we have a buffer zone. Kirk Nurmi you hit it big briles do they need the buffer zone here. >> Yeah I can remember the name of my client but listen, yeah, I've been there Vinnie and I know that there are. >> Interfered potential  interference with the jurors in there does need to be that those deliberations need to be caps actors thinking should not be you know influenced by bloggers who might chase him down 3 or people screaming in the court out. But at the same time and this motion that the Commonwealth is making is laughable. There's no other way to put you cannot resist read the First Amendment rights of basically the entire citizenry because you think that's what it takes to get a fair trial you have to make other measures. You have to  whether that's the side door where you have to move this core this tried to another courthouse that will accommodate that would have those measures yet you asked the jury every day they come in with a influenced by outside sources did they hear anything that would affect their verdict rather than the evidence is before them so the court has to be vigilant about that. But this idea. I have a tough time arguing against this with a straight face of this Commonwealth put this in because it's so laughable  what they are proposing. >> Nima the last trial I cover there was high profile as the Court TV does what they had to have the jury meet at a remote location. They put him in a van. They drove them a certain way no windows in the van drove him to the back of the courthouse and and hustle him in every morning. I mean you could do that and keep the public away from the back of the of the courthouse. >> Well that and you talked about it, it's really comes down to the First Amendment issue I think it's a reasonable  content neutral time place and manner restrictions those are generally upheld because again the Commonwealth saying you can't talk to the jurors all one where the other now Kirk you mentioned is is there a reasonable alternative is this. The least restrictive means I don't think it is we want to see question those jurors obviously high-profile case move it to another jurisdiction, there is much easier ways to get it done in >> beautiful courtroom. It's the historic soco in vans any courtroom all right fasten your  seatbelts, everyone up next. >> In tonight's Tech takes a Playboy playmate tries to get her boyfriend out of jail by allegedly bribing a federal officer now she's facing 16 yea >> Welcome back time for tonight's state takes where we take a look at the world of crime and justice in some store worries that we we have to do him here you can do anywhere else.

S130	https://youtu.be/ni3RqNfBnxY?si=lFrEQ_D37tnJ-3XK	a moment took place on last night's edition of Hannity on Fox news that was so absurd so dishonest that we have to talk about it and luckily CNN host bana Keeler also talked about this and did a nice job of ripping two shreds the dishonest talking points brought forward here by Sean handy so before I play the bana keiller fact check I just want to respond to this clip by itself and then we'll move forward so Hannity is working double time lately to try to run cover for the Republican Party amid the  disastrous situation for them politically given the outrage that people are understandably exhibiting based on the post roie Wade world and specifically in Arizona as we've been talking a lot about the Arizona Supreme Court enabled by the fact that roie way was overturned they upheld a23 year old law Civil War era before Arizona was even a state that's a near total ban on abortion and so the Arizona Supreme Court said this is enforcable and Sean hany understanding how this is so bad for his party and for Donald Trump for  the reasons we've explained extensively in the past on this an example of the world that is caused by the policies of Republicans and the advocacy of Republicans including the overturning of Roy Wade and uh so then here he tries to flip it around and say well is Democrats who are going to have to figure this out so really blame them very weird I'll address just how dis honest it is after playing it take a look and the people on the left are so Des desperate attacking Trump now for an Arizona Supreme Court  ruling that upholds what is a civil war error law Banning abortion this will be fixed in the next week or two let not your heart be troubled I can I can pretty much assure that that will happen Trump opposes the law end this ruling or you can believe Joe's Make Pretend Donald Trump that doesn't exist and you know what I'm gonna really quickly pause your viewing of this video to ask you to subscribe to the YouTube channel just click that subscribe button plus the like button as well and the alert Bell  so you get notifications back to it Arizona's Governor is a Democrat the state's attorney general is a Democrat the state legislature is almost evenly divided if Democrats you want to get rid of the law well you have a chance right now to get rid of it and I would advise you get rid of it they would rather use it as a political tool ahead of November most politicians on the left do not actually care about making your life better the projection there is crazy so before I get to the most absurd part of  this I do just want to say when he says Trump opposes the law so don't blame him Trump takes credit and is to blame for the overturning of roie Wade which is the reason why these sorts of rulings can even happen so no he doesn't get to then go um I guess anything really bad that happens because of me don't blame on me no we're going to blame it on him especially when we go to vote but then Sean Hannity says the governor of Arizona is a Democrat and the Attorney General is a Democrat and the state  legislature is evenly divided and what he means is Republican majority in both Chambers so if a law going to be changed the Republicans would have to get on board with that and guess what they didn't the Associated Press reports the Arizona legislature devolved into shouts of Shame Shame on Wednesday as Republican lawmakers Democratic no Republican lawmakers quickly shut down discussion on a proposed repeal of the state's newly revived 1864 law that criminalizes abortion throughout pregnancy unless a woman's life is at  risk the state supreme court cleared the way on Tuesday for enforcement of the pre-state hood law Arizona abortion providers vowed Wednesday to continue service until they're forced to stop possibly within weeks and so right now the reason why this hasn't been overturned by the state legislature and then yes signed into law by the Democratic uh Governor is because of Republicans Sean and you might think oh well you probably just read me a headline reporting on something that happened after Hannity did this edition  of the show and he was assuming that Republicans would do the right thing and get rid rid of this 123 year old law nope this happened as Briana Keeler will point out hours the Shan Hannity thing happened hours after the event of Republicans preventing the overturning of this law so he's trying to portray to his viewers a situation where Democrats will be the one if this doesn't get overturned responsible for it not at all and if you understand how the law works it's not just the governor who can  unilaterally decide to rip out a law from the books and so I've said this before I'll keep saying it and I don't mean disrespect by this maybe a little bit no I don't mean disrespect if you're watching someone like Sean handy and you very easily could go fact check these things do you not feel insulted he thinks that you won't he thinks that you don't have the critical thinking faculties to go out there fact check what he's saying and then realize he's not trustworthy and he assumed you'll just plug your brain into his show and  allow him to fill it with whatever garbage he'd like that's insulting to you not me it's insulting to you I don't trust Sean hany all right here's ban Keeler factchecking this the answer is Democrats doing him a solid Trump opposes the law and this ruling or you can believe Joe's Make Pretend Donald Trump that doesn't exist and you know what Arizona's Governor is a Democrat the state's attorney general is a democ Democrat the state legislature is almost evenly divided if Democrats you want to get rid of the law  well you have a chance right now to get rid of it and I would advise you get rid of it they would rather use it as a political tool ahead of November while Sean Hannity generally operates in a fact-free Zone he is right about one thing there Arizona's legislature is almost evenly divided in favor of Republicans and when he proposed that Democrats get rid of the law he did so disingenuously and I'm being generous because a Democrat tried to do just that Stephanie stall Hamilton back in January and her bill never even  got a hearing in committee but Arizona doesn't need Democrats to save the day they've got Republicans and one tried to get moving on a vote to overturn that 1864 era abortion ban yesterday and 6 hours before Shan Hannity suggested the Arizona legislature could just make it go poof a republican made sure it didn't all in favor of that motion vote I all opposed vote no eyes have it so Arizona house rep David Livingston putting the Arizona house into recess until next Wednesday less than one week before abortion becomes illegal in the  state all but ensuring abortion providers will stop providing abortions and yet that was the point that was the ca that Trump was chasing when he set up the Supreme Court to guarantee it would allow states to ban abortion yeah great job there from Rihanna Keeler and the other point is you could interpret Handy's point a little bit differently which would be hey there's a lot of Democrats in power in Arizona now the legislature is majority Republican but it's a narrow margin so just a few moderate Republicans and the Democrats  could maybe come together and work on something even though in this case the uh Arizona speaker is the one who prevented it from being discussed but in some situation they can figure something out right maybe that's what he was saying so then is your argument Sean cuz this is the way he phrased it Democrats they're in power they'll probably overturn it all as well your argument then right is that Democrats will make things okay because you have to admit if Republicans had a super majority this is  not getting changed otherwise you would have said hey Republicans have majority in the state legislature in both Chambers so they're going to figure it out cuz they know this is going too far no the world handy that you advocate for would not have anyone in power who would step in and intervene Trump sure isn't he said that time and time again I let the states do what they want to do I don't care and he's the one who even allowed for this to happen by getting the justices that he did onto the Supreme Court and so  then if your remaining argument is yeah but there are Democrats so I'm sure they can figure something out and so don't be mad at Republicans when Democrats are probably going to save the day weird argument Sean I have to say and I think we should just vote for the people who are doing the correct thing and that you're relying on for political purposes to do the right thing to save your political rear end so there it is credit again to Brian keer uh opposite of credit to Sean Hannity for that dishonest mess of a  monologue and please make

S151	https://youtu.be/qSeMOPS7X2Y?si=fvtTpvSO0PkSgOaX	Peter for the audience that doesn't know you and for the audience that doesn't know you I started off with Morgan stany Dean Witter my background and I know your background I think it was with lemas in the 90s take a minute or two and share a little bit about your background how you got into the financial industry well I pretty much have been in it all my life ever since I got out of college you know I went to UC Berkeley in the 1980s and my first job was actually in uh Commodities and commodity options I  didn't stay in that too long because you know too many people were losing money it's it's very difficult to make money in options um and and so I got a job uh a sherson Leman American Express and I was working for um a a division of the company that you know was called Leman Brothers I think you know cuz sherson had bought Leman and then American Express ultimately bought him you know but I was there and I I I I wasn't too happy in that environment either I was kind of like a square peg and around  Hall uh and so I decided to start my own broker dealer and I did that uh in the early to mid 1990s and I owned a I bought a company uh basically was a just a shell company didn't really have any customers but it was a it was a nickel BD uh $5,000 broker dealer you know with at the time it wasn't even fin it was the the nasd was was before they they they they switched over to F so I bought that BD renamed it EUR Pacific Capital and I built it up over the years uh and I you know worked there ever since I  actually sold the BD a few years ago uh part of my move to Puerto Rico and my two main businesses now are your Pacific asset management and your Pacific Asset Management isn't a broker dealer we're a registered investment advisor so we manage money uh I manage portfolios on a fee only basis not on a commission basis um and I also run a family of mutual funds the europacific funds which you could buy directly from us at the website europ pac. or you can buy my funds no load at any uh discount broker I have a  a emergy market fund a gold fund a foreign dividend payers fund a foreign value fund and a foreign bond fund and then another business I started in um about 2012 is shift gold I actually started it as Europe Pacific precious metals it became shift gold uh about five or six years ago I sold the company to uh gold money you know and I just recently bought it back and I you know gold money also uh the guy that runs gold money also started Mane which is where I got all this gold jewelry so um that's how I got involved with the a but  I but I love their love their jewelry matter fact my wife has a lot more of it uh but than I do uh but I bought gold money I mean I bought shift gold back so now I have shift gold and I have europacific Asset Management are my two main businesses I had a bank for about 10 years that's a whole another story the government basically took it away from me as a result of the media falsely accusing it of uh you know they accused me of using my bank to help uh organize criminals launder money and evade taxes  I sued the publish the media company in Australia for defamation and I won a judgment there it turned out that not only did they have no evidence that any criminals use my bank in fact they couldn't name one we asked them in court can you name one person that has even used the bank to evade taxes let alone launder money or commit crimes they didn't have a single customer who was behind it who was behind it yeah I don't know I think it was a political shmear they you know they they they was it close to when you ran or no no no no  this is a few years ago I think the Australian government was trying to get more regulations more ammo regulations on Australian companies and so they tried to protect and that all these Australian companies that were doing business with me were doing business with a shady company but I didn't do anything shady we did everything by the books my bank had 65 employees 30 of them uh were in compliance I only had one person in marketing and in fact when I when I when we sued the company and I got all their evidence from Discovery  what they didn't destroy I found out that they actually misrepresented or outright lied about everything they had every former employe employe they talked to every customer every uh referral agent everybody said that my bank had the strictest compliance of any bank they knew that we asked so many questions that other Banks didn't ask that it took four to six weeks to open up an account so they had all this information yet they lied to Their audience they lied in print and pretended that my bank didn't do any due  diligence that we were just waving through criminals they accused me of having all these criminals uh as customers we didn't have any of those criminals his customers the whole story was made up by the media what really bothers me is that one of the reporters this Charlotte grieve she won a reward Award for best journalist of the year for the 60 Minutes broadcast that was removed for the internet because it it was defamatory get out of here and and and they won't they won't retract the award and you know this is interesting  after after I I won the lawsuit uh the the the media company found out that I was going to put up the unedited interview that they did with me for 60 minutes because it took me two years to get it they wouldn't give it to me I had to get it in the trial through Discovery and so they went to court to get an injunction to prevent me from publicizing the unedited interview because they only wanted people to see the way they edited it to make me look guilty when the actual interview showed I was innocent so they went to court and  they tried to stop me and they told the judge that the public has no right to know the inner workings of a broadcaster and they ended up withdrawing their case and I won because the judge said do you really want me to rule because it could be very embarrassing to your journalists and harm their careers if you forc me to rule and I I wish he would have ruled uh they ended up dropping it but look the the the whole uh it's called Nine entertainment in Australia and nothing they do I'm sure that what happened with  me is typical it's all fake news you can't believe anything this guy Nick McKenzie is considered you know the greatest journalist in Australia he's a complete fraud and you know Wikipedia when I sued and I won this judgment the Wikipedia editors won't even allow it on his page the media yeah that guy the media is whitewashing his reputation he's an outright liar and you know when they did the interview too right they they they contacted me and they said hey we want to interview you about gold and  INF in the economy and I agreed to the interview and the minute I sat down they're asking me about my bank and they're making false accusations about my bank and all these criminals who supposedly have accounts and I'm like you know so they they they entrapped me they induced Me by fraud and then they edited the whole thing and the article which a judge ruled the article wasn't defamatory they had an article in the age and then the New York Times wrote a story followup but they had an article in the age and the 60 Minutes broadcast  and the judge said the broadcast was defamatory but the article was not that was a bad ruling I didn't appeal it because I ended up winning a judgment against the age anyway I'm going to sue them again for injurious falsehood but there's at least 40 to 50 false statements in that article maybe they're not defamatory but they were lies and you know what was so frustrating is for two years they pretended that they can prove their allegations were true despite the fact that they knew they were false I actually won seven  consecutive judgments in a row they kept coming up with these BS defenses and then the judge kept throwing them out and ordering them to pay my costs I mean they just dragged it out follow the story I think you they ended up paying you 360 a third of what you use for legal fees but I want to get but I lost the bank my bank was worth tens of millions of dollars I got nothing it's the that's the part about some of the things here's the worst part they took over my bank I had it was 100% Reserve Bank we had no debt no loans I had  millions of in cash above what the deposits were they took over the bank 21 months ago almost 22 months ago and over that period of time nobody has gotten their money out not a single person one of the customers just killed himself because he's of the financial condition he's in because he hasn't been able to get his money meanwhile in the year before the government took over my bank 75% of the customers got their money back I sent that back over $200 million uh no problem I mean no other Bank could  have withstood that kind of run but we were 100% Reserve Bank so I was able to do it but I nobody would have yanked their money out of there if it wasn't for all these false allegations and the minute the allegations came out I lost my deal with American Express uh that I had to issue cards all around the world I just got that I lost a lot of important corresponding banking relationships I lost my account with the Federal Reserve I mean one Domino after another because people were afraid to do business with  me a 	Leaning Conservative			Leaning Liberal	223

President Biden is trolling Congresswoman  Marjorie Taylor Greene using a speech that she gave to Turning Point USA to tout his  own legislative accomplishments. Programs to address education medical care, urban  problems, rural poverty. The response from the Biden campaign was to slap I'm Joe Biden  and I approve this message on the end of that.

S167	https://youtu.be/SVmgYOAsQzY?si=s_r3vL4_jF17Vhmm	[Music] we are at the Miami seport it's one of the largest uh trans shipment of in the United States for cruise as well as cargo we had a vessel arriving from uh Dominican Republic which has been a very hot route for us lately very high risk for itics so we sent out a team of officers all right let's go as you see this vessel is huge lot of little areas uh that are vulnerable for Narcotics to be smuggled in we look at every crevice on the ships we found drugs everywhere that you can imagine any type of  material that they can use as adhesive stick them onto the the hle of the ship to the interior of the ship on the containers themselves got anybody down the hatches aside from narcotics we also look into uh anything that has to do with human smuggling Stow Wass or anything like that that are trying to come into the United States there you go what is that it's right there it's a pretty big load I just got a phone call from the team on the vessel they found what seems to be bricks attached to the vessel we're  going to bring it back to our shed and see what exactly what we got going on they uncovered nine bricks could be any number of Narcotics cocaine heroin or meth the trend lately has been putting magnets inside of the the tape in order to allow them to attach it somewhere on the vessel where we normally wouldn't look that secure it to the underside of a metallic structure making it much more difficult to find D that's what we want to see cocaine hydrochloride that sort of meets the trend that we've been  seeing now we're going to wait we have nine kilos now that we've tested it we know know what it is we're going to notify HSI uh they're going to start gathering information and start an investigation any day we find narcotics is is always a good day we're we're keeping up the fight keep your eyes open for this one this has a lot of stuff from Paris and France it's a really high-end flight people have a lot of money on this flight uh you can get a lot of currency here you can get a lot of merchandise a lot of it  so this flight if you're focusing on just merch here on the custom side we focus heavily on the merchandise the currency and just making sure that you know everybody's doing the right thing as far as declaring [Music] goes whenever somebody buys high-end merchandise abroad outside the US and they bring it back into the us if their residents here they're supposed to pay something what's called duty to the US government and that's basically taxes in the US instead of the other country that you purchase the item from hello sir  passport a lot of bags what's inside coffee close any high-end merchandise no nothing perect guys did you do any shopping in Paris today sir yes I bought one little ceramic hand for5 okay there you go brother take care man did you do any shopping I did yeah did you declare anything I didn't have to declare anything it wasn't over we have to abide by the rules and a lot of people try to avoid it so how much did you spend out there 3,000 you guys are exemp $800 3,000 over the amount but you know we're out there to you know get  them if you're walking around with a Louis Vuitton box you're going to get stopped why because you got to pay Duty we have a person of interest coming in today we have inel that they have purchased very high-end merchandise in Paris thanks man it that's it we're going to see if they're going to tell us the truth and declare the items and if they don't they might run into a penalty or or even the government seizing their items where are you guys coming from today vacation 15 year anniversary congrats guys you are residents of the  US right yes all right we're going to fill out these Customs questions we'll get you out of here all right yeah sure important question any purchases you made any gifts coming in you would declare right over here yeah I got some Louis Vu nice all right yeah so so any highend merchandise you would declare there you have to pay Duty on all this stuff yeah citizens you know so I hope I hope that's good I am you know trust me and that's it right yep all right I just have to tell you if the government does  find anything else we can seize it okay all right bring your bags this way guys got to see this watch it's yours for you sir yes beautiful is this gold yes that's a cattle when they buy a Rox they just give a cattle you I was like that's it that's so you spend 40,000 on roox and they give you a candle oh I don't know souvenir where are the Lou in there Lou are glasses first so all the Lou for you ma'am yeah you didn't want a Rolex I'll be honest with you so very few people tell me the full truth and  you did today I did the calculations the rates are so low that with your exemptions it washes out but if you had lied to me let's say it turns into a big penalty or thousand you know I get Li every day and when I don't I get happy so telling the truth goes a long way there's special formulas we have to calculate the duty so I'll watch was 90% free the amount of Duty was so minimal only about 30 40 bucks that it's officer a discretion to charge that Duty so he paid no Duty because I think people who tell the truth to that extent  should be rewarded thank care guys thank you once again you made my that's it right now we're at the location we call an intake it's the invisible line where Mexico and the US Feats thousands of people come across throughout the day so we do the best we can to get them [Music] out my team is going to be sweeping all the cars that are here we've been getting small quantities methamphetamine cocaine so they might send two or three loads 10 kilos at a time hoping that if one load gets taken down the other two  will make it through another thing we watch out for is the spots they work for the cartels like there are people are watching us right now as he on the phone that would be a great a spotter doing is mon activi land somebody else they have a good load they'll send two or three spotter Vehicles ahead of it and maybe two or three behind it the front team comes through hey there's no dogs there's no Rovers up here it's good to go they'll send their load through and then the people behind it are sure  hey our vehicle got through nobody's following it we're good to go this black SUV over here he's got a saint engraved on the back window of his car so a lot of the Smugglers they pray to their Saints to protect their load of drugs from us they usually find them around the vehicle or a lot of times they're hung around their neck it doesn't always mean that they're up to no good but it's a good start so we're going to check this guy out you going to sir going home yeah all right can roll down the water he's got  another little religious icon on the dashboard of a vehicle you doing you see mother the one that we're always looking for is The Paton saint of anaros which is Mal it's like the modern day Robin Hood anytime we see see that icon around their necks around their reiew mirror we look further and more times than none we find something in the vehicle he's nervous he's very nervous so he's going to be referred in for more intensive inspection you got so I gave him his instructions on how to drive through the X-ray machine he told  me he already knew how to do it so that tells me he's been sent in before so other people thought that he looked suspicious XR didn't find anything so we'll do an immedate P down now they're going to do what we call a seven-point inspection we'll check some of the areas that are common to be loaded with [Music] Contraband but if there had been bundles inside there it would have showed up as a solid wide [Music] mass in these kind of vehicles we have a very large void in the firewall you can put 6 7 kilos in there once they close  it up it looks like any other vehicle there's no tampering it's good we didn't find anything so we'll run a dog if there's nothing there then uh the gentleman will be good to go [Music] he finished his inspection the dog didn't show anything but we'll keep him in the back of our head that's it he's good to go all right okay you guys pop it open one of the advantages of the seaport is the opportunity for bulk smuggling here you can put a large amount of Contraband in any number of these containers my team here is designated to  check containers coming from drug Source country pop the container making sure that the commodity that's in the container is what was manifested good okay right now we're in our federal Inspection area and we're going to be working the this container uh it's coming in from Source country it has bananas in it so we're going to be uh deving 100% and we're going to x-ray it and do our [Music] inspection and we're going to run uh each pallet to our through our x-ray machine the officer the operator is  going to be uh looking at the image uh just to make sure there is no anomalies Within bananas in the past we found uh they put drugs in between the flaps so basically what we do is we probe all the boxes to make sure there's nothing inside so we go through the whole box we go through the whole bananas make sure feel them make sure you don't have any plastic bananas anything fake if you see anything that you don't like then we examine it more like good example this one feels a little weird get the knife  well Everything feels you know normal in this one it was probably a little hard because it was green but it felt different than the rest so when we have something like that that's when we go ahead and inspect the deeper all right so we just uh finished our inspection of the bananas everything looks good there was not nothing found within the shipment so we're going to be releasing the bananas it could be out on the street uh later today how you doing ma'am can I get your passport please where are you today  Dubai Dubai yeah did you do a little shopping out there yeah I told them I got a necklace which is about $800 all right thank you ma'am all right sir let me take care of you all right come over here where you coming from uh Cambodia Cambodia yeah nice vacation yeah I want to see my sister see you for a while what are you declaring today I I don't declare anything all right fill out the ones I cired here try to get you out of here all right sign here right all right what's in the boxes uh some kind of pickle pickle all right let  me get those boxes up here all right sir what you got to take oh for this always prepared huh one step ahead I don't know all right all right what is this hey is it good I don't know you want to take it out I take it out no just look while I search you bought some gold that for my nie how come you didn't declare this you bought some gold how come you didn't declare this I don't how much is this that a gift for a kid that's ,500 dollar yeah so total together is how much you tell me that $469 it's a lot of  money that's that's a gold I thought it's okay no no I mean it's okay to bring in but you have to pay duty all right it's not going to be so much gold is only 5 and 1 12% 5 half% 5 and 1 12% there's food in in here right tie it up no no no don't cut how do you want to open it you want to open it how you put back in it's not in here you tie again yeah it's fine I got to go to Atlanta Georgia I must stay here all right sir you know what happened two days ago there's another passenger coming from Cambodia right so I opened this bag and  he had crickets in here oh yeah and then he put it in his mouth right in front of me oh you eat crickets yeah why not oh my God if they stand in here they might do that too I don't know I got to open some of these all right okay do your job thank you thank you sir what's this seeds what that oh pepp black I'm just going to ask agriculture if it's allowed in the US all right is this okay black pepper he said what this yeah it's good yeah all right sir you're all good here I'm just going to calculate the duty until then you pack  up all right so he bought some gold over sees it's about $4,000 he's a US citizen so he gets a $800 exemption the next th000 is the automatic 3% rate so we're left with 2469 at gold rate which is 5 1 12% that's 13 5 plus 30 all right sir your duty is going to be 165 okay well go to the cashier get you out of here I think he was unaware that you were supposed to declare this stuff when you bring it back into the US so he paid Duty 165 bucks and he was out the door so make sure you declare any expensive  stuff next time okay thank you sir here in CBP Maritime smuggling distruption unit we have been tasked with working here at the seaport to conduct walkthroughs and search any and all inbound and outbound vessels we're getting ready to do a boarding on a vessel that's arriving from Dominican Republic we're going to meet a few miles out get on board do our inspection we target specifically based on the country of origin Dominican Republic is considered one of the hot spots for Narcotics trafficking all right let's make sure we  focus on the actual structure the outside first okay this is what we call a walkth through we look for all small crevices anywhere that there's space or any area that's hard to access for every single ship is different and the bigger the ship the longer it takes for us to be able to do it now see some of these things like this got to get underneath the drug trafficking organizations they always have the upper hand cuz they're the ones hiding it we're the ones trying to look for it it's always a cat a mouse game always  always trying to you know catch him but skills and knowing where to look and how to look is a big deal when it comes to this hey M we checked this area here too hatches were opened we're going to go inside we have have a couple of areas that need to be checked that's got a a hatch usually they're locked and they're not locked crew coming down if we can get in it anybody can get in it so we got to verify make sure there's no Contraband narcotics or whatnot [Music] good yeah we're goodone good today unfortunately we didn't find  anything we'll make our way back and we're pretty much done all right come on let's go all right we do this often it's hard work but it's fun and it's rewarding when you actually find something you know it's a good feeling graas good morning anything to declare to them where you hit it okay look like there was some modifications done to the under carage of the car so we're going to go ahead and do an inspection on the vehicle right now and see if there's any tampering uh done to the vehicle that would show signs of of  having some type of illegal narcotics in the vehicle okay Bingo packages about an hour ago CBP intercepted a vehicle the driver she was very scared very hesitant to talk to us looks like it's Laden with 7 to 10 keys of what we think is cocaine one tool we do use is what we call a control delivery what we do is when we gain the cooperation of one of our violators we'll use them and attempt to deliver those narcotics to another individual in hopes to further identify the narcotics organization and further the  investigation as a whole uh what's the 20 of the target vehicle the agents were able to build a rapport with her and gain her cooperation and we were able to get the driver to deliver the vehicle to its destination and we're waiting to see who comes and picks it up at which time we'll arrest that individual and if he cooperates we'll try to deliver it to the next person the whole idea is to move up the chain take down the initial driver or take up the pickup individual hopefully that'll lead to a stash house  where more narcotics are stored the higher you go up in the network the more key players will identify and that paints a bigger picture of the network and which Cartel they're associated with they're sending us screenshots of the text messages with the cartel oh man they're telling her to go back to Waters right now it looks like we're being tested by the organization or the cartel we believe that they have counter surveillance setting up watching the vehicle they're telling the driver to go back to Mexico of course we can't let  that happen so we'll come up with the reason why the driver can't so what we're going to do is inform them that the vehicle won't start we have their product that is their money they're going to do whatever they can to come get it so we'll try to work that to our advantage and push the envelope till someone does come to get it [Music] [Music] hi how you doing can I see your passport Miss sure where you coming from today oh nice girls no luggage sir hold on are you alone yeah where are you coming from ma'am I'm  coming from India why so many bags ah because I went to wedding my two KN beding all right it's a lot of bags so I have to check come with [Music] me how long were you there I was there for 3 weeks okay so you're declaring 6,000 right yes in clothes clothes no jewelry right I have my own jeel I went to the wedding so how was the wedding two weddings how are they good you know how Indian weddings are right long right it's a long I enjoyed it is this gold my granddaughter gave me this nice it's a lot of gold jewelry  that I'm going to have to look into if it's really coming back with her that she took out as she says or is it really purchased from outside the US and she's trying to smuggle it in so I'm going to ask you mhm why do you have this receipt for one emerald ring yeah so what happened is I wanted to clean it so my Jeweler does cleaning over there yeah in India you have a family Jeweler I cannot to have it cleaned here I took them to wash it and clean it and make sure if I find receipts we're going to have a problem  here right yeah no please goe it's good your check I just have to verify okay have nothing to hide you can open up my wallet [Music] too so you did buy some gold I I bought it for my niece her wedding anniversary is but you still bought it I bought it how come you didn't declare this sorry I forgot what other gold did you buy that's that this is the only thing I bought you sure yeah you can take a look at it don't don't touch that hold on I won't touch only I can at this point yeah what is this uh I don't know jewelry  receipts so you purchase this just on this page we have a lot you see this 6,000 right it's a lot of money we have to add this up this team right here will come out check the the container this see if the commodity in the container matches what was manifested and then we will physically do the inspection to make sure that they [Music] match the Manifest for this container it's showing a styrofoam Packaging I see like some brown boxes that looks like a different commodity so let's just go ahead and send it back to the shed so  we can take a better look at it all right all right we have an anomaly so it's probably good that we run the dog all right it's AOC good boy good boy there's something in there all right let's take let's get this whole front side yeah let's take the whole front side off six Brown boxes that do not belong they're not showing up on the man at all all right you bring us in that's good bring us in let's bring this one down yeah I see not stoam yeah go and take it off oh yeah we got something all right see what we got I'm going to prob  a couple of these oh yeah yeah we got white powder yeah we have white powder just by looking from a specific cartel probably coming out of Dominican Republic may have originated from somewhere else also we have six boxes so we're going to take it back and test it to see exactly what type of substance that it is and then we'll take it from that point going forward ready 1 three this box is heavy get this one out yeah take this they're all taped together here we're going to use some knife can get some  more all right so going go ahead put some of this on there [Music] positive cocaine senstive test positive what we're going to do is weigh it and then we'll also contact HSI to see what steps they want to take next [Music] you purchase this we have to add this up all right so how much is this adding up to do you understand this is adding up to $5,000 well that's one side we got to go on the other side there's exact prices of how much you paid she has1 $15,000 worth of gold are you aware you have to pay Duty on gold I already paid  the taxes no you pay tax uh Duty here I mean I already paid for the taxes and I have to the D so when when you come into the US yeah right all purchases you have to pay Duty on these items right yeah already paid taxes but that's irrelevant to us you have to pay duty to the US government when you purchase anything you know what tell me what I I have receipts from all over the place yep some American receipts are also so make sure you don't take those ma'am I do this every day I know exactly what I'm looking for but I want to make  sure we'll make sure before you leave at I want it to be fair it's always going to be fair ma'am okay all right we're going to move on to the bags so you did declare 6,000 in clothes and the new clothes that you are declaring are in there right y can I put back pleas yeah you take anything out no I want to make sure I have all my jewelry otherwise I have to complain well everything's recorded so you can file a complaint if if you think something is missing I have to check it out yeah because how do I know I got all  my so you're declaring $6,000 right $6,000 because I bought sores for my daughter and my me because of the wedding yeah and then we have more here 6,000 I'm roughly sa okay but you have to declare things yes the right way if there is a failure to declare The Government Can seize these items I know I know that so I am very familiar with I been I'm a US citizen okay but you didn't declare everything because I go back at 4 six months but did you ever pay Duty supposed to pay here like this I declare it I pay taxes on this okay  where here and I pay my overall taxes okay no that's irrelevant this is US Customs and you have to pay Duty here okay okay that's fine so I'm going to make the calculation so the cloes you did declare you were doing good but then we have a lot of items missing so on those items you're going to have to pay penalty items you did cler is going to be $56 the penalty on the other items is $5,600 so I have to ask are you going to pay it or yes I am but this is ridiculous I go there every year you're telling us not to go to our own her  penalty was pretty hefty but people who want to bring in1 $15,000 worth of gold are going to get penalized and she decided to pay and she walked out of here with her stuff tough cookie Hey Brother Mexico's insisting on her bring it back to W is okay all right sounds good all back the cartel keeps asking her questions keeps telling her to take the vehicle back to Mexico we've gone with the r that the vehicle won't start so what we'll do is have two undercover agents posing a shopper stop to make it  look like we're trying to fix the vehicle with the anticipation of any counter surveillance seeing that and they will relay that information back to the cartel to give legitimacy to the the claim we had her make approaching the driver side now [Music] friendly making contact with her our agents are going through the motions of inspecting the vehicle to see what's wrong with it and then she'll make contact with the cartel and watas and tell them hey we just had someone look at it it's not working what do you want  me to do in hopes that they send someone to come pick up the vehicle has been closed and friendlies and subject are not walking when it comes into these types of operations patience is the key a control delivery it could take 20 minutes could take hours the longest I've ever been on one is 7 Days not ready to to give up on it yet be cognizant of a Mercedes stationed right now with a male subject inside not exiting the vehicle looks like they have a view of the target vehicle right he had a gray looks like a  Nissan SUV pull up right next to the Mercedes New Mexico tags both subjects exited and are have any discussion outside they are walking towards the target vehicle both occupants left the vehicle they're headed towards the target vehicle actually they're going to a GMC pickup truck to talk to the occupants there and this looks like it's uh legitimate business discussion they're having they're not paying attention to our Target vehicle so it doesn't look like they're associated with this smuggling attempt at all you just got to  be cognizant of everything going on around you you know to determine whether it's part of the smuggling operation or if it's just like I said actual legitimate work hey brother what's the status okay we gave it the shot to see if the counter would change their mind but apparently that didn't happen the cartel is still communicating with the driver however they're being insistent on the vehicle and the driver going back to Mexico subject walking towards the target vehicle get ready to follow out  so this point we are going to throw in another Roose that we got the vehicle running and she's going to take the vehicle back to Mexico however she will be stopped and inspected at an outbound inspection they'll magically find the narcotics in the vehicle vehicle going be on the move the target vehicle is going back to the Port of Entry at that point we will start processing the evidence the narcotics and see what kind of intelligence we can obtain I think there was a spawner once we got there and she made counts and they said  no return to what is I think we were burned from here right now they're doing an inspection of the vehicle here we go packages to make sure that we don't miss any bundles that might be hidden with inside the car we have found a total of eight black tape bundles and we're going to go ahead and test it to confirm that is cocaine they had a lot of wrappings have plastic foil and another plastic positive for cocaine 8.97 kilos of cocaine we attempted to conduct this control delivery however sometimes these  operations as well planned as they are they just don't work out but it's not a failure in any way cuz we were able to collect a lot of intelligence a lot of information which led us to be able to Target other individuals other co-conspirators the case was presented to the United States attorney's office who did accept Federal prosecution of the driver so at this point the driver will be booked into the El Paso County Jail to await her initial appearance her arraignment the following day and we're  still communicating with her and doing everything we can to uh Ensure safety as much as [Music] possible what you got it's covered in some type of oil what kind of oil right now we don't know it looks like it's got a copy paper and layers and layers of Saran Wrap and uh vacuum seal packages all to throw off the dog see how many pounds we [Music] have 215 kg of cocaine feel pretty good it's a good day at Miami seport this is not completely uncommon we do see seizures of this size and this amount several times a year but the  officers out here do a great job of inspecting cargo that's coming in and these types of seizures really create Havoc for the organizations we are going to attempt to identify the folks who introduced this Contraband into the shipment hopefully we can take action to get them into custody [Music] 	Center			Leaning Conservative	227

with failure to wear a seat belt and refusal to provide an ID next we go to the case of this psycho Karen who went crazy when she realized that she was going to jail for assault get the me get off me going to move we going to we going to move on the 24th of January police officers received a report from Miami International Airport about a crazy customer who had assaulted an airline  employee the young lady and a friend had missed their flight and for some reason decided to blame the Airline employee for it when the officers arrived at the scene to understand the situation they had to interrogate an eyewitness it was at that moment that they began to realize the level of Karen they were going to deal with I think she threw some of the flexiglass or her phone I'm not sure exactly I just know some the girl go ah and then blood okay and then there were crazing crazing can two females I did take a picture picture  just or video just I didn't get this which I wish I would have but I was more worried about watching it making sure everything was black and reason why because it almost got out of hand there the officers approached rather gently if you ask me they approached smartly but like let's calm this thing down so they did a good job there uh the one girl was just off the hook uh the one with the colored hair in the see so I can reference the girls and you'll know who's he had one in pink yeah she's a second  girl so this is the second girl this is the first girl that caused the biggest biggest commotion right there okay so the one in the pink was causing the commotion but not at first she spawn on she bled off the other girl you know she saw it going off get off my friend get off my friend you know what I mean going off dropping F bombs that's CU two officers approached her cuz she's out of control then she got out of control and he tried to approached her and then caught her down and then she was like don't touch  me I ain't done nothing wrong so he was kind of like a little passive which is fine okay then they smartly moved her out of here she's going crazy and spazzing out and they had to put her down to the ground at some point you got to I was like they need to put her down like they were like two nights that's when the other girl got loose and the two officers were down I had gotten off my bike now and I saw her coming and I was ready to

find more food I always do hey I'm confused you said that you needed money for food but then gave it to other people I'm sorry I hope you're not mad no no not at all I'm just  curious why I mean I may not have much but there's always someone that has less than me I've always believed that the kindness you put out in the world has a way of coming back to you I like that I like that oh I'm Chris by the way oh I'm Hank not sure you want to shake my hand no I don't mind oh nice to meet you Hank you too I wish I had more cash to give you so I mean you could get some food yeah don't worry about me I'm fine and I'm glad that your $15 helped a whole lot of people Hank I got you some food  this nice man at to drive-thru he ordered me two burgers I figured I will give you one since you're always doing so nice things for me oh thank you Wendy secret told you I'd be fine always figure it out this good did you want one oh no thank you I appreciate it but uh I got somewhere to go um it was really great meeting you guys I'll see you around nice meeting you too Chris oh this is good thank you Wendy well shall we eat honey oh sorry Mom I just thinking about this homeless guy that I met he's a very nice man oh  yeah you wouldn't believe it I gave him $15 for food he probably only had a little bit of spare change to his name his clothes were dirty probably didn't shower for a while and you know what he did he spent the money on other people every last dollar I was shocked I mean who would do such a thing mom are you okay yeah um just something you said it um prop packs some memories you help someone did the same thing no someone helped me a homeless person helped you that doesn't make any sense I've never told you the sweetheart  but when you were very young there was a point in time when we were [Music] homeless you see my dream was always to start a family but your father he never wanted children so when he found out I was having you he said to give you up for adoption when I refused he decided to leave to make things even worse after you were born and I needed to take time off from work my job said they couldn't wait for me to come back they decided to let me go eventually I got behind on bills I wasn't able to keep up without any  income so I had no choice but to sleep in the car I remember one day things got so bad I didn't know how we were going to eat but then a kind man helped us when I least expected and he continued to help day after day until I got back on my feet so you see for a few months after you were born we also were homeless wow Mom I can't believe you never told me this story well it was so very long ago and thankfully our situation didn't last very long but it's just so sad to think that there's some people who can't  escape it especially knowing that there's such good people out there David wait oh just throwing away the leftovers since no one usually eats them did did you want some more no I have a better idea hey you don't happen to have a dollar on you do you I need water oh man I had a dollar but I ended up giving it to this boy who really needed the help sorry that's all right Chris what are you doing back here I told you'd be seeing me soon this time I came prepared so uh hope that helps no you didn't have to do all all this look  what he bought us exactly what I needed thank you so much my pleasure hey Hank uh there's somebody I'd love for you to meet my Mom it's [Music] [Music] you you're the person that helped us when we were homeless I did he did your name is Hank right you don't understand what you did for me I was at the lowest point in my life and you helped me get through it wow that makes me so happy to hear you know I always love when I run into people that I've help a long time ago and to see him do so well well to be  honest I've come back multiple times looking for you I figured you'd left the street I I didn't realize you were still here well I haven't exactly had the best luck and at my age it probably be a little too late for me right now there's not any extra food in there is Sir H oh yeah sure hold on [Music] you know maybe you'd have better luck if you didn't give everything that you had away true but either way I manage thanks to nice people like you you know why don't you come home with us we have lots of extra bedrooms  at our place no I I mean thank you for the offer I mean you've done more than enough I don't want to be a burden anyone oh you aren't a burden I'm serious and it give me a chance to finally thank you for what you did for us that's a great idea I mean come on Hank I mean you would be doing us a favor yeah besides a wise man once told me all the kindness that you put out in the world will always find a way to come back to you well since you put it that way wonderful come on let's get out of the coal all right all right  [Music] 	Leaning Conservative			Leaning Liberal	231
S222	https://youtu.be/7mzrC88G_L8?si=y8bZeybBM_BnME1T	God I love being an American I have so many freedoms that other humans just don't have in the rest of the world like the freedom to criticize my government the freedom to choose my own religion the freedom to call myself an American on YouTube despite knowing that it's going to infuriate pedants who are going to be in the comments screaming about how America is actually several continents and not a country and also you know the freedom to use whatever apps I want to use did you guys know that in China residents can't even use  Facebook Facebook it's just a silly little app for talking with your friends but it's because the authoritarian government of China is terrified of free speech because if Chinese citizens have easy access to Western media they're going to be brainwashed by our propaganda and then they're going to want freedom and democracy the things that I enjoy as an American anyway let's see what my congressional representatives are up to today a potential ban of Tik Tok in the United States sailed through the House of  Representatives over the weekend as part of a $95 billion foreign aid package that garnered bipartisan support the social media Crackdown mayand Poise to become LW since President Joe Biden has vowed to sign it if it passes the Senate and reaches his desk oh well nevertheless now I have used Tik Tok I am on there I don't use it often because I find it uh annoying and not very interesting but that's hardly a reason to ban it from the entire country I also to find Taylor Swift annoying and not interesting but it should still be legal  to buy her albums because this is America and you know why are they only talking about banning Tik Tok there are certainly issues with how social media collects and uses our data for instance but what is it that makes Tik Tok so much worse than Facebook or well apparently it's because of China Senate intelligence committee chair Mark Warner Democrat from Virginia an Ardent supporter of the ban urged the house on Thursday to pass the updated Tik Tok bill for years I've been raising the alarm about the powerful national  security threat posed by Tik Tok and I strongly support their divestiture from a company legally required to do the bidding of the Chinese Communist Party Warner said proponents say a ban is necessary to prevent the Chinese Communist Party CCP from accessing American user data which they worry could be used to spy on users or manipulate their interests oh of course of course in order to prevent an authoritarian regime from manipulating the smoothest of American brains we must Institute our own authoritarian regime  to stop that from happening it makes perfect sense actually so some people are going to argue that this isn't actually a ban because first we're giving the company a year to sell Tik Tok to someone more I don't know American uh but if they don't at that point a ban would presumably go into effect that means that our govern government would force Apple and Google to remove the app from their stores which means that new users can't download the app and existing users can no longer get updates unless of course  they use a VPN don't worry I am not about to start Shilling a VPN I don't it would be the perfect place for an ad break right there but reminder all my videos are sponsored by my patrons so you know if I'm ever recommending a VPN I really mean it so a VPN can make it look like you're trying to access the app from a different country but the average Tik Tok user is absolutely not going to bother doing that and I speak from experience here uh when the US government decided to crack down on online poker by throwing a bunch of  legal and financial obstacles in the way of players 99% of users stopped playing and the only people left were the ones who were making decent money so they were incentivized to go through those hoops and that my friends made online poker super not fun anymore so they effectively banned it so yeah it's fine to call this a Tik Tock ban it's also fine to call it a xenophobic possibly unconstitutional distraction to make people think that our politicians give a about our privacy and our exposure to plate and disinformation as they  steadfastly refuse to take any real action to prevent us from being at risk of either of those things because here's the thing yeah Tik Tock sucks they collect as much data as they can on users including voice face location data they have previously censored anti-chinese government topics like fallong gong and tianan square and they've had employees access sensitive user data like when a financial times journalist learned that they were spying on her because she had written articles critical of them in the past but you can  say exactly the same for every other social media company as Julia anguin wrote for the New York Times back in March Facebook helped inight a genocide in Myanmar censors criticism of Elon Musk amongst many other things Google has fired dozens of employees for accessing private data and misinformation runs rampant everywhere if the Chinese government wants to sway glial Americans opinions they don't need Tik Tock when they can just as easily do it on Facebook like the Russian government does and if they want access  to Americans private data they can just as easily Buy buy it from data Brokers just like the US government does that's right I'm so sorry if this shocks you but perhaps one of the reasons the US government is trying to ban Tik Tok instead of passing comprehensive consumer privacy laws like those recommended by the E and other experts is because the United States government themselves profit from the lack of those consumer privacy laws data Brokers are companies that collect your information whether from bits of code in the apps  you use your social media presence your grocery store loyalty card or public records data they then collect all of that data together to get a really clear picture of who you are where you go what you do sometimes they add in some extra algorithmic guesswork like how long you're going to live and who you're probably going to vote for then they sell that package to someone else whether that might be a financial institution considering giving you a loan a con artist considering dragging you into a pig butchering scam or the  Department of Homeland Security considering shipping you off to Guantanamo and they do all this legally sort of maybe thanks to some handy loopholes in the way they interpret the Fourth Amendment a report from the Brennan Center for justice describes the problem with our government buying data from Brokers instead of bothering to investigate and get warrants for that data unfettered government access to personal data without judicial or legislative oversight can exacerbate existing biases in law enforcement and  intelligence practices permitting speculative investigations on the basis of constitutionally protected categories and the targeting of marginalized communities evidence of this phenomenon abounds from the defense department purchasing location data collected from prayer apps to monitor Muslim communities to police departments purchasing information to track racial Justice protesters as state governments continue to pass strict anti-abortion legislation laws that disproportionately harm women of color such misuses will  only expand and as President Biden's recent executive order on artificial intelligence acknowledges the integration of new AI tools will make it easier to extract re-identify link infer and act on sensitive information about people's identities locations habits and desires amplifying the risks to Americans privacy and freedoms of speech and Association they end that report which they published back in February with a call for Congress to please act quickly to close these loopholes that leave Amer Americans at risk and  Congress has answered pretty clearly nope we're just going to ban this one app and leave all of that warrantless spying in place the Tik Tok ban is ridiculous and also dangerous you know for one it may lull the average American into thinking Congress is actually doing something to protect them making it even less likely that we're ever going to see a comprehensive data Privacy Law and it's also dangerous for our democracy giving the president the power to ban a social media app and thereby censor  speech at whim might not seem like a big deal but only if you forgot that Donald Trump was President for four years and also if you forgot that Biden is a human who also sucks in his own ways anyway if this garbage law passes you can expect a lot of bad to come from it and meanwhile honestly Tik Tok is going to keep on existing there's the year grace period and then there will be legal challenges and so on and so forth and basically maybe Tik Tok will be banned around the time that some new social media app  catches our Collective attention and we all forget about Tik Tok anyway so if you get a chance to talk to your local Congress Critter please let them know that you'd actually prefer they do something positive and Institute consumer privacy laws that will actually protect us instead of this weird xenophobic Power [Music] Trip hey everybody thanks for watching if

S235	https://youtu.be/Z7xzXi_BfLI?si=PkuZV9CRDkgfsxkP	hey welcome everybody to our midweek update at Hope for our times and man is there a lot going on or what as we look at everything it's hard to just say oh it's a coincidence that all of these things are happening at the same time and we're going to be looking at some of these things here in just a second uh specifically we're going to be looking at the the the zero hand we're going to be looking at exactly what's going on in the area of understanding so we can understand where we are in the timeline of the second  coming of Christ I'm saying we better get ready uh listen we'll be there in just a second but first of all I just want to remind you if you're up in the Seattle area uh coming up about a week and a half out you can check it out at Hope forart times.com go to the the website there on the events page and we're going to be up there for the weekend going to be a great prophecy conference with Dr Billy Corone Eric Barger p uh Pablo frini and myself looking forward to meet you guys up there especially those who I haven't  even met yet uh so let's get going with what's happening right now as we look at events on the world stage I think of the words of Matthew chapter 24 where he tells us disciples uh regarding the answer to the question what is the end of this age the sign of you're coming in the end of this age he went on and he says to them take heed that no one deceives you uh many will come my name saying they are the Christ listen there are many that say they have the answers we don't need Jesus we've got the real  spiritual answer they're replacing the truth uh so uh just self-proclaimed Messiah is the whole bit that's everywhere but deception is increasing tremendously then he went on to talk about wars and rumors of wars and and there'll be earthquakes in various places we right on down that list there will be pestilences and then he also said But the end is not yet why is that because ultimately all of these things are fulfilled at the end of the tribulation period but all of these things will increase like birth pain so that's why  we are watching this happen as we continue reading through this passage he even warns that many will be offended for his name's sake man you mention Jesus now seems like just about everybody is offended you mention Israel now in a pro position man do you offend people I'm about ready to offend a whole lot lot of people I'm pretty sure of it and then he said this and because lawlessness will abound the love of many will grow cold uh you drop down there a little bit further verse 15 he says therefore when  you see the abomination of desolation spoken of by Daniel the Prophet standing in the Holy place then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains let those who are on the housetop not go down to take out anything from his house and on down that list his persecution will increase against Israel and against Jewish people specifically so as we see this in the context where he says lessness will abound you got to ask yourself a question if Israel is the epicenter actually Jerusalem the epicenter and and  the Temple Mount is the bullseye of all these things and the Jewish people are the people that are the target during the last days then when you read about law list this abounding I am thinking that it will be the Jewish people who will be the target of uh lawlessness also they'll be the prime target and so that explains why we are seeing certain things taking place that we are watching right now so don't be too discouraged but at the same time let's put it into the context because I'm going to show  you a couple of things that if you haven't been paying attention and you love the Lord this will trouble you so first video I'm going to show you is some pro-israel men that are attacked at an anti-semitic protest call it what you want proas which is a terrorist group Pro Palestinian call it whatever you want it's an anti-semitic protest and these pro-israel men are attacked at it watch this watch this first video kill yourself kill yourself commit suicide commit suicide running traffic got jump  off a building you can do whatever you want I'm not going anywhere I will keep reveal the truth about all of you why you so close what up [Music] all right all right so you see that right and we're watching what's going on and we are starting to see this type of thing happen all over the Western World all over the Western world it's not just here in the United States things things are happening over in the UK uh even in the land down under it's happening everywhere up in Canada um northern California listen this is kind of a  repeat of what we've been watching with Columbia University and on down that list this is uh Northern California in a university just the other day as you watch this video they take over this room uh why aren't these people arrested you know as you look at this why aren't they stopped again these are people who hate Israel they really uh hate the Jews if you watch something like this yelling and screaming of course wearing masks uh you look at all this nonsense that they are doing but this stuff is evil we're  just seeing it happen over and over again listen Jews are told uh to stay home for their safety isn't that rather interesting if you want to be safe you got to stay home don't go to the synagogue um you better watch out for your kids going to a Jewish school it is for your safety my friend Olivier melck has much to say about this because it's very reminiscent of well let's round up the Jews in their own neighborhood right 1930 Jews were told certain things were for their own safety too the only  listen the only safe place for Jews right now seems to be Israel and Israel is being attacked by terrorist organizations and led by Iran and much of the world what are they doing all they're doing they're just cheering these things are happening friends again it is not a coincidence that you and I are watching these things develop the way they are developing again as I look at the Bible um lawlessness abounding ultimately as you read this everything centers on Jerusalem so you understand that with Bible prophecy things make it  begins to make sense by the way if you're interested on knowing some where some of these things come from several years ago uh Olivier Melnick and I did this this uh video documentary will the hatred ever stop it's available if you're interested it's in our uh hope for our times store for download you can just download it but we go into the details we look at church history you wonder why our church is becoming so anti-semitic and anti-israel why did it happen during the days of Nazi Germany so we walk right on through um world  history as it relates to the nation of Israel and you can check that out if you want it I think I think you'll enjoy it very informative real informative as I was able sit down and ask uh ask Olivier about the question so okay let's keep going as we look at all these things that are here U NATO look at this look at this article NATO member rules out red carpet for Kamas Chief so why would NATO do something like that I mean you're looking at something like this going what is really going on here  listen the world is turning against Israel this is not again it's not a coincidence Zechariah 12 the Bible's very clear that the world is going to gather against the nation of Israel and it's not just we're leaders it's people Gathering against Israel hating Israel ultimately that will have its fulfillment at the end of the tribulation period but friends how close are we when we see this happening right now did you ever think that you would see anti-Semitism that you see right now if you're a Jewish person looking watching  this did you think you would see it like you do right now and then look at this list of US colleges that have become breeding grounds for war rooms or breeding grounds and War rooms for growing anti-Semitism look at this list this is huge Arizona State University Carnegie Millan Columbia University as we all know Cornell look at this Duke George Washington Harvard Illinois Wesleyan University Wesleyan hello look at these things Northwestern University Princeton Rutter San Diego State Stanford yeah I  mean just go right on down this list University of California Berkeley I just wrote by that the other day University of California Davis look at all those UCLA UC San Diego UC Santa Barbara University of Michigan University of Illinois University of Minnesota Twin Cities what a huge list University of Wisconsin Madison uh wellis Le college Yale universities friends this is a huge list as you look at that these are these are becoming War rooms for anti-semitic but here's a fact this is not a Grassroots Global anti-semitic rise it  is funded check out this next article here and we'll post links for these articles in the description too but look at this leftwing dark money group funds bail legal support for anti-israel agitators blocking traffic look at this an act blue fundraiser says uh contributions while benefit Community Justice exchange a project for the Soros funded Tides Center so what do you know George Soros involved don't forget this in funding hey let's stop all the traffic on the freeways stop all the traffic on the  highways who do you think is funding these anti-semitic groups in the colleges do you think these are just kids rise up just on their own listen it is that age group where you're rebellious you're away from home I I remember those days being quite rebellious and being at that age group and you jumped on the latest Trend and this is a trend to hate Israel uh so you start looking at this going okay you start to find out there's money behind it yeah there's money behind it a BLM was funded there's all kinds of money  behind it and if you pay attention you're going to find out a lot more of these things are funded but it's funded anti semitism and it's amazing how many people are going along with this check out this next article um look at this 2024 USA or 1933 Germany Colombia University's Rabbi tells Jewish students to go home over threat of violence um I I look at all of these things stay home you know I think my friend Olivier Melnick is is on to something when he says look if you look back at Nazi Germany stay home make sure  the Jews are in their neighborhood and then if they leave their neighborhood and get hurt the police say hey um it was your own fault we told you to stay home I mean you can watch what's happening and then as Olivia points out uh you start looking and going is this beginning of rounding up the Jews into their neighborhoods you have the ghettos and then we know ultimately Iran would love to have as many Jews as POS possible move to the land of Israel because they want to wipe them off the map the devil would like that too by the  way ultimately this is a spiritual battle that is taking place but guess what uh Jesus wins and the devil's going to be defeated but you look at all of this anti-Semitism yeah you you add all of this up and you start looking at everything and the pressure that is growing against Israel to enter into peace at all cost with the world powers that be I think of um just the other day I had jam marel on and uh she made a great statement she said just look at this and you start to realize with all of the anti-israel sentiment that is and  if you're Jewish and you see all these people that seem to want to kill you they want to eliminate you from the planet and they came they come along a leader comes along and says hey guess what I promise you I can protect you I can make sure that you live in peace I can make sure that all of this goes away I will keep it all subdued none of it will happen guess what I'll even build a temple for you over in Jerusalem I and the Jews find a man that is convincing and they know that can pull those things  off guess what as she said do you not think that the Jews will say yes by all means listen and she's right this is the perfect setup the devil is using this to set up the Jews for Antichrist uh that's what that's what's being that's what's taking place here in fact when you look at the whole picture the lawlessness that's abounding in all different areas the economy that is teetering we know eventually it's going to collapse um you you look at the rise of these different problems you look at what's going on  with borders and the destruction that's coming the rise of terrorism uh all of this anti-Semitism Mr Fix It Mr Antichrist is going to come along and say I got the solutions and man the world is going to go after him and the Jews will be deceived at first but not all Jews are going to believe that he's the Messiah and uh great salvation is going to come to Israel at that time but right now they are being set up for this Pastor Mark Hitchcock wrote an excellent article on this you can find it on harbingers we also have the the link  here in the description but look at this um are the Nations seeking to impose a peace Covenant between Israel and her neighbors um I personally look at that that's the direction things are going John Hower and I have been talking about that for the past couple of months we're going to impose peace when you look at uh Isaiah chapter 28 it starts to make sense Israel will enter into an agreement according to Isaiah chapter 28 to avoid a Scourge that's coming against them so we watch this incredible Scourge  in the anti-Semitism that's taking place it's disturbing as we see all of this but we got to remember a couple of things all right right got to remember this we have hope Israel has hope the Jew has hope the hope is in the Jewish Messiah the Lord Jesus Christ listen when it comes to Israel and the Jewish people please know this what does the bible actually teach in the Book of Genesis chapter beginning in chapter 12 God made a covenant with Abram and it's a covenant that is an Everlasting Covenant it's a covenant forever he  called them all the land of the calans the land of ER and he gives them this land the land that they are occupying right now but a lot more than what you see there on a map right now that's only a tiny sliver of what God actually gave them recently and I was in Israel I went and stood on the hilltop where Abraham believed to have been given the instruction look over here Abraham lot chose Sodom and Gomorrah God says don't worry about it Abraham I am giving you an Everlasting Covenant Along Comes  Abraham and then he has a son Isaac through Sarah and then uh Abraham Isaac Jacob and the 12 tribes of Israel God says I have an Everlasting Covenant how long is an Everlasting Covenant it's forever and then in the Book of Ezekiel Ezekiel chapter 36 God confirms it he says listen wherever I scattered you uh you profane my name but I'm bringing you back because my name is on the Covenant and when people are anti-israel saying look at this bad Jew over here look at that bad Jew over there it's interesting  you single these you single out the people group and you start saying all the world problems are because of you you Jews that's where this is going God says listen um I'm bringing you back cuz my name is on the Covenant I'm going to give you a new heart unfortunately what's happened within the Gentile Church world is like we so many churches that have become anti-israel and replacement theology well God's grace is good for the Gentile but it doesn't apply to the Jew well not according to God's word in fact God is going to use  Israel as a witness I believe against the Nations I believe the Bible's very clear on that God's grace and mercy is for the Jew and he's bringing them back into the land we are watching this these prophecies being fulfilled he's bringing them back he has a his name is on the Covenant and Jesus himself said in Matthew chapter 23 I will return again and you will say blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord in Zechariah 12 God says all the world will be turned against Israel but guess what Israel  will be saved and they will look upon Him whom they pierced but right now World pressure is against Israel it is only going to increase against Israel we can watch what's happening right now and we start to understand Israel is being put they're in this pressure cooker but God here's what's happening God is moving his prophetic clock forward and Israel is the epicenter in fact as I mentioned earlier Jerusalem and the Temple mount the epicenter and then Israel the nation and then the PE uh the the uh the the lamb mass and then we  look at um the people of Israel the Jews they are those people but it with all of this I want to encourage you to stand with the truth of God's word and to stand with Israel and be encouraged by these final two things I'm going to show you listen I'm pretty sure the comments are going to be off the charts about how evil I am as a pastor supporting Israel listen I don't listen to those lies this is what I listen to I listen I listen to God's word I read God's word and I understand God's covenant that he made  with Israel it's a forever Covenant and God is going to use the Jew and Israel uh to hold up against those who condemn them uh not understanding God's grace it's going to happen if the Bible's true I believe the Bible's true both Old Testament and New Testament but nevertheless I want you to be in curse so I'm going to stand with God's word I'm going to stand uh with God's covenant that he has made check out this first video it's a short one from Brazil be encouraged by this because not everybody is against Israel be  encouraged check out this this short video coming from Brazil [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] wow so you look at that wow a pro-israel stand not a protest taking a stand the I praise God for seeing that that's down in Brazil in fact we have our outreaches to Mexico that are coming up in July but we have an official one for greater Mexico and Brazil as we're looking into 2025 we're going to tell you a lot more about that um uh but we're going to get through this uh  current uh Outreach to Mexico first but again greater Mexico and Brazil that is coming that's cool okay last video I'm going to show you sonas on Dr Phil check this out listen be encouraged by this right understanding right teaching first of all we need to understand what is the problem because from uh a personal experience with the Jewish people all I saw the most amazing most productive and most successful nation in the world that don't harm anyone else so why the Muslim people hate the Jewish  people they don't have a reason except the ideological reason and that is in some Islamic texts they say that Muhammad had a problem with the Jews and Muhammad is their Prophet so they follow his footsteps but in reality Muhammad did not write a word that says anything against the Jewish people you can say hatred and one motive but it's not only hatred it's human delusion it's Envy it's anger I I look at that coming from the son of Hamas he didn't get into it into that short clip But ultimately it is a  spiritual battle that is taking place and the devil hates Israel the devil hates the Jews because he knows he has a problem um Jesus says I'm going to be returning to these people and he wants to eliminate them because if he can eliminate them he can eliminate Jesus from coming back so it's that's what's really going on in a nutshell it's going on listen the it's not a coincidence to watch all of these things taking place and the pressure to turn against Israel will only increase I want to encourage  you to be proactive right now in your thoughts and understand what the Bible actually does teach the whole Bible the Old Testament the New Testament and understand God's covenant that he made with the land of Israel understand that his Covenant and is Also regarding the Messiah the Messiah had to come from a people Jesus is the Jewish Messiah and uh listen be incourage Jesus is coming back Israel will still exist the people will still be here and all of this is a reminder that the Bible is true that you  can trust it everything is taking place just as the Bible says it will and as we look at everything moving forward we need to remember this if you can trust the Bible for what it says regarding the days that we live in and you also understand that all of the Prophecies of the first coming of Christ came true just as the Bible says all of these things are evidence that our Salvation is in the Lord Jesus Christ only uh only in him can we be saved Jesus himself said in John chapter 14 I am the way the  truth and the life no one comes to the father except by me he has come that we would be forgiven of our sins folks I implore you if you do not know that you're going to heaven then that's evidence that you you are not going to heaven because you haven't trusted Christ only in Christ can your sins be forgiven ask him to forgive you of your sins and if you are honest in asking him to forgive you of your sins he will forgive you of your sins he himself said I will no way cast out anyone who comes to me the Lord Jesus Christ will forgive  you but ask him to forgive you now folks it's not a coincident that all of these things are happening at the exact same time 	Leaning

S236	https://youtu.be/e4gkWMnOH3c?si=Kjko9J9SaIb9iBpP	I show up home from work that evening and I park my truck and and in the driveway my son come out of the house and he's like something happened to Natalia at the school she fell she had her head she she's crying I drove over there when I got there my daughter is crying loud a lot of pain she couldn't move her uh her legs neither one she keeps saying over and over I can't feel my legs and I keep asking to her what happened she looked at me like she was like lost and she's like I don't know what happened I'm like how did I get here  like what's going on I was like I don't remember anything everything's blank it was very clear that uh this girl was on the sidewalk and that a car left the roadway uh and struck her we had U tire track marks Impressions a motor vehicle had went up and over the curb straddled the sidewalk and then eventually came back down on the traveled portion of the road we learned Nicole P was 42 years old she lived in the de Mo metro area in the still photo she was at the front door knocking on the door but we didn't have  any video after that according to talking to her ex-husband she was there to see her daughter the time of of her being in the area was right we had to find this Nikki pool and we needed to get her in for an interview we had found out several days later that she was in the P County Jail Nicky pool had gone to a a convenience store in West de Mo she was clearly either Under the Influence or having some sort of mental health episode at the time Natalya thought the vehicle that ran over her it was a dark colored Jeep and  she thought it was a female driving the vehicle I authored a search warrant to search that vehicle it looked like there was a shoe print mark on the passenger side door and the dirt that was on the car it looked like Impressions from clothing like that pattern had been impressed into the side of the car that really started to bring Nicole into the picture as the suspect I figured Nicole P would not answer any of our questions I figured she'd just sit there and say no I want an attorney so we went in there with a more  relaxed approach so I know you were you were there getting gas all that what happened what did you do before what were you driving what color was that so what you you ran over on accident I was just in awe I kind of had to pause there for a second and try to get my composure oh my gosh she just admitted she ran somebody over you remember what she looked like did you know that you mean when youer yeah we saw face why why didn't you stop I I just okay like taking over what do you mean by taking over  home okay home is our child she keeps throwing out Mexican taking our jobs taking our homes at that point I knew way more serious than what I initially that I thought it was it was a hate crime when you went over to tur did uh did you accelerate did you step on the gas did you do because she was Hispanic did you did hoping to in or actually that person at that time yes at that time is that right yes when we walked out of the jail we were both kind of in shock being a minority I promise you it it hits  home our investigators heard from the de Mo Police Department that they were invest instigating a a case where uh a car had gone up on the sidewalk and a child had been hit by a car and she was the person that did that we have a single incident but just expanded and blossomed into this huge you know pattern of activity that she was doing on the whole west side of De Mo I really fear that if she had not been stopped at that point that uh uh there may have been other victims in in other ways it's  really disheartening to see where you can take that rage and turn that toward children who've never done anything to you who are just walking down the sidewalk as all of our community's kids do every day this behavior is not acceptable anywhere especially in Clive it was kind of a relief for us oh you know great they did it they find they found who did it but then when they give them the notice why she did it that was a her breing I was just in like a State of Shock I didn't I didn't know whether to  cry or to scream or to just like run away I knew there was racism in the world but I never knew that it would happen to me like two blocks away from my house my wife and I we had the idea to leave the country forever but no one is going to push me away we stay to prove our kids that they're belong here we can't live uh uh in fear and we can't let that destroy my [Music] family she was described as having some sort of a mental episode the mother made a decision to take her up to the hospital to have her  checked the mother and daughter that brought her there left leaving Rory in the care of the hospital for whatever reason she ended up leaving before she was actually seen by a physician we see her exiting uh the hospital on her own that was the last known sighting we had of her Communications I'm a plumber and I'm on site for at uh a job and we got uh we're we're snaking a drain and we were uh we've been pulling back uh we probably pulled back about 10 PBS 15 pounds of like it looks like flesh type of stuff  meat and I don't we don't know what it [Music] is the issue started several days before he didn't want any plumers called um he tried snaking the drain himself he was taking efforts to fix it uh by the 29th it it was getting so bad uh the smell uh the pipes were backing up into the people's uh bathtubs people upstairs just took it upon themselves to call a plumber the officers on the scene decided to knock on the door of Adam Strong's basement apartment they recall him putting his head down and making a comment almost  instantaneously that the jig's up uh it's a body he commented to the arresting officer if um if you want the rest of her she's in my freezer and she's pretty defleshed and uh there in fact was somebody in the freezer as Adam said Rory had a distinct tattoo she had the word a live tattooed on her neck and when they looked through the freezer they found a human head and there was a tattoo uh clearly displayed I knew right then yeah it's it's Rory we didn't know at that point what the cause of death was to lay that  charge you you need the ground rounds the decision was made to continue our investigation to see where it took us down the road you said to the officers if you're looking for the rest of her you'll find her in the freezer my question to you is the person in that freezer or Rory I'd be planning to answer that question okay you're saying you declined to answer it but you're shaking your head this way does that mean anything no okay any interest from you at all in telling us your side of things no  nothing no all right I was told these things can go on for like hours is that true it can it's true after 3 hours of doing it it was clear we weren't going to get anywhere excuse me we were just going in circles obviously you don't care enough to help are the tissues off needed why do you want some no no I'm good yeah let's just shut it down now we could have sat there for another 3 or 6 hours I don't think we were going to get any different results I'm uh you know what walk you really all I got from that interview  was a sense of of who Adam was to help us going further down the road with the investigation thank you very much it was the worst apartment I've ever been in for clutter and dirt and mess you could barely move uh because of a few little walkways in there there was a number of sex toys located in the apartment restraining devices handcuffs and whatnot there was a bent Hammer we had located Rory's DNA on Ro's running shoes were located in a bag in the apartment there was blood spatter located on the wall  and bottom baseboards leading into Adam's bedroom that knife's only designed for one use and one use only it's a knife used for by hunters for cutting and skinning animals to a logical person it doesn't make sense you keep all that evidence around but seemed to be the way Adam thought the DNA that was located on that knife it was it wasn't through blood it was tissue like material we sent that knife off for analysis we received results back that knife contained the DNA uh of a second female the second victim uh was a  19-year-old female who went missing in 2008 and very much like Rory she um was out of the house uh on her own both victims were in their late teens and both victims were more of a petite build longer you know brown hair almost a splitting image of each other she went missing 10 years prior and Adam when undetected for 10 years it makes the hair on the back of your neck stand [Music] up I certainly felt some pressure the we his if there was no conviction then he was a free man how you doing good you I'd better  days I sure Paul mitt Adam WR ad me call me Paul all right Paul I have been amazed at how well I have been treated other than a few staff members at the eight egg and that's going to continue to thing yeah I can tell you that I mean that's it's good well you know what certainly checked into how he had been treated thus far that's important uh speaks towards a disability addressed any needs that he had and he said he hadn't eaten so we took care of that see com oh sorry I certainly knew we couldn't rush  into talking to Adam about the case given the fact how it went with uh the two detectives back in December of 2017 sharing a meal with somebody breaking bread with somebody it's a chance to bond and talk and then once um that had gone on for an hour and a half or so I started to talk about the case a little bit um how old was Rory 18 okay how much of her body did you guys get back obviously the entire skeletal stretcher right well we obviously whatever was in the house in the freezer yes and how much of  it were you able to pull out of the pipes quite a bit it was it was bad luck yeah that's what I tell people they're like you're stupid I'm like you kidding me well that's an awesome way yeah I just I just got greedy that's all all importantly doesn't React to what most people would perhaps react to which is you know again a rather shocking thing to say every time there was a little bit of information given to me maybe even unknowingly by Adam strong inside I was giving myself a little fist pump only  because I thought we were advancing the case a little bit here so the 24th is when you start this you said Christmas Eve yes are you are you doing this while it's Frozen or It partially defrosted completely defrosted okay now that would take several hours wouldn't it uh no not B up hot water okay okay like within a couple hours I wouldn't wager I had to fill the bathtub up a few times I that the water hot gotcha gotta I don't know if I should really be talking about that but ultimately you do have me on the there's  no getting around that y y he thinks and they are only talking about dismemberment and Disposal but in fact it's allowing the in this case the judge ultimately to make inferences about what must have happened during the actual murders that took place okay okay all right well I'm going to blast man go get some sleep d i appr appreciate you sticking it out well have a choice no but uh I probably said more than I should have probably yeah probably but that's okay the judge watched the entire 12-hour interview went through it and  the ruling came back quite clearly that uh strong was well taken care of he seemed comfortable his needs were all met there was no trickery there was no oppression this was essentially a slam dunk in terms of Mis ability which is rare for a 12-hour interview Adam was convicted of first-degree murder on Rory and ultimately convicted of manslaughter uh on the second victim detective Mitten uh and the investigative team get a first-degree murder charge and a manslaughter with no confession there definitely was a danger  they pulled the indignity so if if things went South in that interview room I I he may he may have walked that would have been a travesty it's really tough to describe Adam strong I have never met an individual like him it was a it was a tough investigation but we we speak for the victims we're trying to bring them Justice and and and give the family the answers the sentence he was given is the maximum sentence you can receive in this country so yes I feel Justice was [Music] served calling number1 where your  emergency I need an emergency right now the shooting at the at the corner store next to St okay do okay do you know if anyone's been hit get an an here now we are who was his some young man bleeding to death somebody just shot this kid three times okay we got everyone in route to him right now this guy is dying I'm the guy is dying the victim was eventually identified by his identification being found in his wallet by is Joseph Edward Ross he was eventually transported to the hospital War he passed  our crime scene comes takes photographs really documents what's going on because there is a lot of activity crowds start developing so we start going up to those crowds hey did you see what happened did you hear what happened the witness s the scene observe the victim walking through the parking lot talking on a phone and arguing and shortly thereafter they observed a red Dodge pickup truck pulling into the parking [Music] lot do you have any idea why we might be here okay your brother Joe was shot and  killed around the corner over at the corner you was shy yes we're trying to find out what happened till do you know anybody that drives like a red Dodge pickup truck oh my friend Nick does who's Nick it's just someone that I met through friend what he look like is he white or black he's white okay and he always hangs all the black dude do you know the the black m name I think it's Jal what else do you know about Nick he normally carries a 38 or a 9 mil have you ever gotten into it with your brother they argue about a lot of stupid  so Nick's really he seems like he's crazy I would really want to M Jonathan Ross said Nicholas SAR was 23 years old um a smalltime drug dealer who who was out of work all the links with the red Dodge pickup truck the history between the two of them the subject being armed on a regular basis it obviously then at that point propelled Nicholas naring to being the suspect that we were looking for before we entered the room to interview Nick he was sleeping this referred to as the per naap someone who's typically guilty will  actually fall asleep in the interrogation room because they're so exhausted from the stress associated with waiting to be arrested Nick right well I'm detective parnet this is detective Parson asleep that's s okay do you have any idea what this is about no I don't know it's um gun Point got on the car got out of the car yeah but do you know what anything that you have an idea what left that no not now when you were stopped you had a couple of guns on you mhm I was going to go to shooting range when put turn the corner  and the lights went okay well while we're here is we're investiga something happened earlier T night and we're wondering if you can tell us what happened T that with you night um I was at home for a longest time is there any reason that your truck would have been at the CVS around the corner of the night no should have then how was it there I don't know the reason that it was there mhm is because something happened there okay he's very engaged right now he's up at the table he's close in he's in a very  strong position and at first I'm back so I move in to show that I also have a very firm position in my assertion that his vehicle is there if it seems as though I'm not sure he'll take that and he'll run with it and that allows him to have an escape you had three guns on you tonight yeah one person yeah you fire any of them tonight yeah okay well let's just say for example that maybe it's not one of the three that you had on you it doesn't alleviate the fact that you were there when shots are fired no  you were involved in something tonight at that location and I'd like to hear your side of what happened there when he's feeling threatened he starts to back up and the hand that he's able to actually goes into into his pocket so it's another defense mechanism that he's using where he's hiding and concealing what actually happened you can [Music] choose to be deceptive all you want okay I have no reason to be on this side of town point this thing is this is that you were there because people wrote down the tag  number of your truck there okay no other truck shouldn't have been there would in my possession it was there wouldn't in my possession there but you were there I wasn't there yeah you weren how do you know that video cameras did you see me in one view you're kind of distinct so I'm guessing that thing had little video around the whole camera around the whole store I'm not this video everywhere because there's n at that point I didn't have video of the shooting but he's nodding cuz now he believes it so with him I  felt comfortable throwing out the bluff in such a way because I I didn't think he was going to call me on it and I thought he would accept it I that explains why it right in my ass does lying help you L me then stop it why did you do what you did but the truth yes okay that's straight up honesty a okay he deserved it he reach nothing shot the mother his face he made a no not shot no his true face comes out and it comes out in Grand fashion we were speechless he just didn't care it was just it was  pure evil like d consequences be need to do this yeah you right up CU I used my truck and Camera from the very beginning of this investigation it was a who done it and within our we had the suspect in custody we had a confession we had him charged and he was on his way to jail Nick nering was sentenced to life in prison that confession showed that he planned to kill Joseph from the very beginning and it showed his mindset that he did not care there's no chance of Nick getting out ever he'll die in prison and that's  probably best because I do believe that he would kill again if he had the chance I was on patrol and I heard the call come over dispatch drive I have a female with stab booms attention ambulance ambulance is needed you could tell by the tone of her voice that it wasn't [Music] normal Sabrina has a 12in bread knife that she is holding in her right hand she covering in blood I can see blood on the blade I can see blood on her immediately we started scream to drop the knife it almost like Snapped her out of whatever she was in  back to some type of reality I kicked it away from her and we put her down on the floor it was a very tense couple seconds the suspect Sabrina zunich she was a 18-year-old foster child of Lisa canel also inside the house was Megan sella and Haley canel Megan being 13 and Haley being 3 years old the father Kevin was away on a trip he was a truck driver and he was in Michigan at that point Sabrina was in foster care for many years before she came to the canil Sabrina Landing with the Nils really represented a fresh start for her  she went from a troubled home with her biological father and Grandma to a youth shelter where she did not want to be she's getting along with the family she's doing great at school she's not getting in trouble things seem to be looking up for her I couldn't find anything indicating something like this could happen [Music] please you remember me right our main goal when we first interviewed Sabrina was to get Sabrina to tell exactly what happened we caught her coming out of the room so we knew she did it we wanted to know  why so what uh what do you recall yday mhm get ain't done with my homework I don't know and that's it mhm B and we at home mhm what anything unusual happened I don't know how do you get along with Kevin Kevin and me are cool I mean he more the one that helps me out because this has Mak to deal with and so we made agreements a long time ago that if I need anything that I can go to Kevin how about oh with Lisa how you dealing with her me and Lisa have never been the best she's never seem to like me and she's been wanting me out of  the house what's your thoughts on how Lisa is not alive now what well you you had an kn you stay police son I did yes did and and Megan called the police it can't be true it is I'm sorry this's really dead is dead sorry I don't believe this nobody else was hurt nobody else was hurt thank goodness Sabrina never denies committing the murder she just confused when I tell her that she's the one who killed Lisa canel we could have waited here for 4 days and we were probably going to get the same answer from her we made the  decision that we're just going to cut this down because she's not going to give us anything else that we need I was hoping to find some text messages some emails some search history as to why this crime took place over the past several weeks Kevin canel and Sabrina text messaged each other over 1,000 times I did not think it was normal for a foster father and a foster daughter to have thousands of text messages between the two of [Music] them he go rob arm we were confident that Kevin left for work at 8:00 p.m. the night before the  murder and he didn't get back into town until after Lisa's death so we want to know from his perspective as to if there was any argument going on at the house before he left and then you told me you wanted to talk about his wife's work the subject matter yeah sir I told his lawyer that we would just talk about the work but I was hoping that maybe he would open up and give us some insight as to um what was going on and what why the reason that this happened Kevin do you know anything that was happening at the house the night before  you left for work that night hang on a second we just talked about talking about his wife's work what's going on at the house T night before is not his wife's work okay where did your wife work at K County Children what did she do there she was a social worker for the um children's SE he was looking down there was no uh tears um there was no anger were you and Lisa in the process of going through a divorce okay now we're getting outside the scope Kevin canel was not willing to help the police in finding out exactly  what happened to his wife why is he not cooperating with us what is he hiding from us [Music] so a profer is a good faith First Step uh when the defense attorney the prosecution meet with the suspect it's an opportunity for them to be 100% complete honest and tell exactly what happened it's a first step into a plea agreement we cannot use this against her Court what we believe from conversations is that what led up to this homicide to this murder is that there was another party involved in planning that  yes this Kevin canel my foster father it was Kevin's idea and it was talked about after we were having sexual relations and him and Lisa were having problems in marriage marriage he wanted to get a divorce but Haley which is a 3-year-old daughter of his and her was in the picture and he wanted full custody she would get custody or it would be shared and he didn't want that happening so the alternative was for this to happen when was it after you started to live there on a daily basis that your relationship with Kevin  changed when did the sexual nature start to change um it all started not with sex but with massages because he was a truck driver and his legs would cramp so it was inner thigh then it progressively got into sex does he ever tell you hey you can't tell anybody about this all the time did you say what would happen if you told then you'd be taken out of my care and I could lose my foster parent license what did you say in response to that I would never do that okay tell on him as and Kevin's relationship continued Sabrina  described the increasing pension she felt from Lisa and that Sabrina felt that she wasn't welcome in the house anymore so Kevin convinced Sabrina that if she did Kill Lisa and did get caught that she would only do two to five years that he would protect her and that after she got out that he would be there with her they would buy a house and basically she can be like a figured Haley so have you talked to him no not no money on my books no letters no calls no nothing nothing nothing that's when we learned that  Kevin helped plan this murder it was calculated and essentially Kevin using Sabrina to get his wife out of the picture and to collect life insurance money Sabrina's childhood I believe is probably the most important thing to understand why something like this could happen Sabrina had never experienced a stable family a loving household the sense of security the sense of belonging Kevin seemed to know how to pray on Sabrina's vulnerabilities in my opinion the verdict came very quickly the jury came up with a guilty  verdict I believe it took a matter of about 2 days since call 911 where is your emergency um it's like a non we want like report a Miss person it's my sister how old is she she's 25 and what is her name Samir Watkins where was the last place you saw her last place I seen her was on Thursday night around 8:00 we're getting off her over there to you samir's sister said that the night Samir went missing Samir worked a shift at her job she went home she changed her clothes she let her her sister know that she was going over  to talk to her boyfriend Zachary Littleton and that she would be home later that night she was never seen or heard from again so it just made sense to go ahead and talk to Zachary Littleton as quickly as possible to see whether or not smear had actually made it to his apartment he could very well be the last person that had seen her you'll have a stay here I'll be right back okay Zachary Littleton was a 24-year-old member of the United States Navy he was stationed here in Pensacola at Pensacola Naval Air Station and  Littleton was M's boyfriend what's your phone the god-given birth name Zachary Antoine Littleton what's your U address um I was standing at 3500 cran Road at the apartment but I moved today two days cuz my wife and my my daughter she they'll be here in Friday the 6 she was stationed in Goose Creek and I was station here so the Navy decided to put us together so we oh so you're both in the Navy right where's de Creek South Carolina so youall finally get to be together cool that's really good we learned Zachary Littleton was married to  an enlisted Navy sailor who lived out of town and was caring for their child Littleton was a bit of a a Playboy that's easily a an indicator of somebody that's flat out a liar and who probably will lie about other things so you know the reason why you're here we had that discussion I over the phone about uh Sammy going missing you know her as as Sammy yeah okay um but you've had some dealings with her and you've talked to her yeah she's been over to the house like maybe four or five times would chill kick it or whatever but you  know it wasn't really a relationship it was just friends and what I thought it was so you've known her for how long then a few months not a whole year been a few months did your wife know that you were talking to this girl no okay would that be a problem if she knew that no cuz she knew you know I have a lot of friends did you have any kind of a relationship with Samy that was more than just friend no I need you to tell me exactly when you saw her last wed definitely Wednesday yeah Wednesday somebody  dropped off so I like why you come just popping up in my house like that and I was like you know what you can you didn't you need to leave she was she was getting like attached so I just told her I'm married I got a daughter so why why she it was good while last and you knew it from the gate you knew it from the beginning that you w going to be the woman in my life and that's when I took her home does it strike you as odd that we're here talking about her it stri me cuz uh missing and SC but it messes me up how does it  mess you up cuz how is that possible I mean I didn't do it anything I'm not responsible for her being missing I ha it for cuz she was a nice person she wasn't no feisty type or no she had good tendency to be a good woman there was a period during the interview where Zachary Littleton would refer to Samira in the past tense she was this or she was that I I that struck me as odd at this point she is missing but she could be any number of places and be perfectly fine Litton had definitely not relieved my suspicions of  him nor did he lead me to to where she was at and as he left I felt like he very well could be responsible for samir's [Music] disappearance we learned Samir Watkins you recently become pregnant samir's family made it very clear that Littleton definitely knew she was was pregnant and that the baby was his her family said that Zachary Littleton was not happy about this information Zachary Litton was so against her pregnancy that he encouraged her to get an abortion on the morning of November 3rd  some jet skiers found a large duffel bag that was washed up on shore of a Waterway very close to Pensacola uh Naval Air Station the bag had a foul odor coming from it there was insect activity on and around it and there was even blood that was seeping out of the bag when the Sheriff's Office got there and they opened it up they did find a body of a female inside of that bag deceased she had no clothing on except a bra and she was curled up in the fetal position inside of the duffel bag a latent fingerprint examiner was able  to conduct a fingerprint comparison on site and they were able to report that indeed this was Samira Watkins we later learned that cause of death was asfixiation uh most likely a strangulation it completely changed the whole look of the investigation it was now a homicide and Litton was our main suspect when we opened the bag there's a few things that we learned first and foremost she was missing an earring when Samir went missing we knew that she had been wearing both earrings because we obtained the video  surveillance from her employer finding that second earring would be so important if I found it in the possession of an individual they would certainly be potentially the killer there was also a couple of of paper towels in the bag you could clearly see that it had a distinct pattern on it during that search we found some key pieces of evidence we did find a roll of paper towels that matched exactly the print of the paper towel found inside the bag with Samira but the biggest thing found at littleton's  house was that matching earring the earring we've been looking for that was a direct link between the victim the scene and the suspect any doubt that I had which wasn't much was now eliminated I knew that Zachary little was our killer Zachary Littleton was sentenced to life in prison without parole Justice was served this was such a tragic case and involved a young mother and her unborn child and because of that there was this special sense of desire to do justice for them I remember it being brutally cold I got  there pretty quick a black pickup was lodged against a tree we've all got our high powerered flashlights and we're all on our hands and knees trying to find evidence at the bottom of the ditch very hastily covered with some leaves and a stick there was a body of a young male there were multiple gunshot wounds I received a phone call from the dispatch that a body had been found next to a pickup in a ditch on a road that is known as substation road on the way I was hearing radio traffic of a possible sus suspect could  be walking down the road north of that so I kind of decided to check it out on the way and I came across to an individual walking Northbound on the highway he was wearing a suit with white shirt with tie had a trench coat on and I found that OD at that time in the morning I made a quick U-turn in behind him he spun around um not knowing whether he had a weapon or not I drew him a weapon and ordered him on the ground M said I'm going to ask you one time do you have a weapon on you and he said no but I am  the guy you're trying to find I'm the guy that killed the guy on substation [Music] Road my name is under JT pmer me and you met on side of high 177 in about sing Road at about 312 this one didn't we yes sir okay and what do you remember telling me ination that I'm guilty yes of what of murder okay and who did you murder uh Jano I do not know how to spell that but it is with a G okay and and how did you murder him with a gun I shot him in the head twice and did you go to school over him yes sir was that his pickup or your  pickup I'm fairly sure it was his sir okay and you remember what kind of pick up that was uh black okay and how' you guys look up I went down to his dorm room and asked if I could be given a ride to Walmart in exchange for $20 gas money we pulled into the parking lot then I pulled the uh weapon on him and demanded that he take me to Asher Oklahoma sir and why did all of a sudden did you decide that you need to go to Asher because I was planning to take him out into the country and kill him and so I guess at some  point did you decide it was now was the time yes sir uh shot once missed shot a second time hit jumped out of the car went around he was driving 10 15 M hour so it was out until he already had hit the tree I heard him gurling uh I'm not sure if that was a physiological or physical process after death but uh I thought that he might have still lived through that somehow because he was gurgling so I shot him again and then shoved him down in the [Music] ditch and then I tried to cover it uh admittedly not well with the leaves  dirts and uh stick and so after you got the body covered up what did you do then I um headed back to the truck and tried to get it unstuck and so you could get the truck out so what did you do then then I walked away and I headed north and in my mind I'm thinking wow and I never had interviewed anybody that had been that cold and callous you killed a young man yes sir why did you do it if I'm pressed to answer I'll say it's to prove the strength of my resolve but that's only if I'm pressed to answer I'm not pressing you I'm just  trying to understand then I don't know why okay so it just popped in my head and why him all the kids in college here why why him I believed that he would have had the least impact sir impact of what ah I believed he didn't have many friends or many close friends I should rephrase his absence would be less notable you don't think his girlfriend would missed him you don't think she's going to be UPS set heartbroken I think she will be sir how that make you feel no different sir or you going to kill  anybody else no sir tell me why I should believe you that there just was going to be one person that was going to suffer from your consequences of killing you have no reason to believe me sir do you feel any remorse no what do you think should happen to you death sentence sir and why do you think deserves their sent an i for an ey [Music] sir all right um we'll be getting you taken out to the jail here shortly that yes sir I've done a lot of interviews and I've had them where they're crying and  they're upset they get mad he didn't he looked you right in the eye on every question probably the only interview that ever did that the her kind of stood up on the back of my neck this is pure evil talking to [Music] [Music] me Jared Murray's defense Council had him evaluated they very quickly found him to meet the clinical the legal findings of Not Guilty by reason of insanity antisocial personality disorder the characteristics are a flat effect a lack of empathy uh lack of impulse control and a bunch of other things that  fit Gerard Murray to a te Gerard Murray was going to a secure facility where the high risk the very dangerous people that are found not guilty by reason of insanity are sent but 15 years from now now he's going to learn how to play the system he's an highly intelligent and highly dangerous man is there a chance he can be released absolutely he can't I was angry I was livid he's not in the place where he should be he should be imprisoned he's had the taste for blood he got away with it once and so he would try to do it again I think  that if he ever got out everybody around him would be in danger because you just don't know what would set him off the law changed this protects everybody my son's life had meaning and his death will have meaning [Music] our dispatch had received a call of a possible body that had been wrapped in a tarp a lady who lives in the neighborhood was out taking her dog for a walk as she always did and the dog started pulling to the wood line in this area called Clark sandpit it used to be a pond where they  mined sediment so there's this giant dead end a lot of people use that area for dumping just random stuff simply because it's not an area where people live the the first thing you could uh notice when you got down there was the smell decomposition of a human body once you smell it is something that you never forget almost adjacent from the body and the roadway was a half sheet like it had been broken in half of sheetrock and the sheetrock had a good Tire impression and there was also a visible footprint  there was also orange twine that didn't appear to be weathered so if an object had been left out there for a long time there would have been weathering to it we kind of put two and two together that determined that these objects probably or more likely all came together during the time of the body dump we initially observed this white Mill that is bound with duct tape not only on his body his hands but what was very distinguishable was he had duct tape WRA wrapped all the way around his face you could still see that the  fingerprints were intact so we had crime scene taken ink impression we rushed it back to our uh fingerprint lab and they were able to ID him as a Charles [Music] lock when we arrived we noticed it was basically unkempt a lot of grownup shrub and bushes around there we go try to make contact we couldn't get anybody to come to the door so after attempting contact at Charles Lock's residence we observed that Teeter tottering both properties of uh Charles lock and his neighbor was a trash can and in that trash can we  observed some broken sheetrock as well as those orange orange pies that we had also seen at the scene a light bulb came on at that time I mean could this just be a coincidence or are we kind of on to something we don't know at this point whether Calvin Allison's a witness or a suspect but given the fact that we do have items that are at his residence which are also at the scene there was a good possibility he was a suspect not much my name's B Alvarez Sergeant Mars Calvin Allison was a transplant from Oklahoma to Pensacola

S256	https://youtu.be/i2eQQvvjYgQ?si=UPZn3nL4SAqfRcGT	MAGA Republicans, like Don Jr., are really upset with House Speaker Mike Johnson, the guy you see next to me, who secured nearly $100 billion in military funding for overseas wars. But despite the backlash he's facing from the First MAGA crowd, it turns out that Don, Donald Trump himself, is still backing Johnson, putting him at odds with his own son. And once again, the U.S. base is not happy. Yesterday, they asked Trump straight up why the base is so upset with Mike Johnson.  "After the House approved the military funding bill, or rather, the military funding bills, since there were four separate bills. Anyway, here's how he responded. How do we balance this divide between MAGA and Mike Johnson, with his support and ours? We've got a majority, right? He can’t just do whatever he wants. I think he's a good guy. You know, he really had my back on NATO when I said they needed to pay up and do it fast. He was totally on my side. He agrees with that."  "He also took a good chunk of money as a loan. And he definitely felt that. But it’s a tough situation when you’re in one. I think he’s a really good guy. I believe he’s trying really hard. And again, we need to have a big election. We need to get some people in Congress who are way better than what we have now. We need to elect some good senators and get rid of some of the ones we have, like Romney and a few others. We need to have a great day and win the presidency."  "We’ve got to take this chance to take a shot at Romney, obviously. But for those who aren't up to speed on the NATO mess, Trump is talking about the pressure he put on other NATO countries to spend more on their military and defense. And to his credit, he actually pulled it off. Germany, in particular, really ramped up their military funding. So that’s what he’s getting at, Genk. Just pausing here to spit some honest truths, like we do in our news too."  Tite is facing challenges, guys, just like the whole industry is. Who could really make a difference? You. If you hit the join button below, it’ll make all the difference and keep us in business. We appreciate it. Thanks. Yes. I can’t wait to see the showdown between Donald Trump Sr. and Donald Trump Jr. But just a quick note. He always cracks me up, no matter how outrageous it is. He really agrees with me a lot. Nobody just kinda agrees with him; they either fully agree or not at all. Right?  Now, I should point out a few other things. Trump has been pretty against Ukraine, even when he was president. So, I figured he’d at least criticize the $65 billion allocated to Ukraine through those funding projects. But he didn’t say anything about it. He didn’t mention it at all. I think it’s probably because Johnson met with Trump, and during that meeting, Trump said he believed military aid to Ukraine should be in the form of a loan.  About 10 billion of those 65 billion will be in the form of loans to Ukraine. Maybe Trump feels like he's being heard. But it's interesting that he's taking a pragmatic approach by mentioning the slim Republican majority in the House. Now let's look at the other side of this equation, which is the MAGA crowd that's not happy with Mike Johnson. This includes Donald Trump's son, Don Jr. He posted a video on X last week with the caption: "If you start believing anything the Republican leaders say, watch this."  And this is the video he posted saying, "Everyone listen up." We told the American people, "Border, border, border," that we need to make real changes to border policy. This is a must for everything we do moving forward. We have to take care of our border first. That's what the American people want. Every state in the U.S. is now a border state—border, border, border. How can we protect the borders of other countries if we don’t protect our own? We know how urgent the situation is in Ukraine.  "Let’s fight for freedom and make sure Vladimir Putin doesn’t march through Europe. It’s about time we protect our border. Listen, this is a disaster. The battle is over the border. President Biden wants a supplemental spending bill. - It's time to get going. - Defending American national security. There are dangerous people coming into the country. Over 300 known terrorists. How can we protect the borders of other countries if we don’t protect our own? Well, Don Jr. should have a chat with his dad."  "Which basically made it clear that he doesn't want Congress to pass any immigration reform or border security laws because he wants immigration to be decided in the general elections. It's wild that this is what Don Junior decided to focus on. Jake! What do you think? Yeah, I love watching this kind of social media drama between the two Donald Trumps. Here’s my take on what’s going on: First off, Donald Trump Jr. probably doesn't have much influence with his dad."  "His dad thinks he's an idiot. So it's clear they're not on the same page at all. I don't think if his dad told him to shut up and support Mike Johnson, he'd apologize and be like, 'Sorry, Dad.' Instead, he'd run right back to Mike Johnson's side. But the kid's trying to play it cool online, like, 'I could make a meme. I could do these videos. What's MAGA base? They hate Mike Johnson. Yeah, I hate Mike Johnson too. And then Dad shows up and gets on his case.'"  He says, "Alright, Dad, just watch. I think Donald Trump Jr. is going to turn on Mike Johnson. If he says anything, he'll realize the next thing he says will be positive. Right. That shows they’re not really talking much in the Trump family. What does Trump really want? Well, Jr. posted that video about the border. But hold on a second. Mike Johnson took care of the border law for Dad, for Donald Trump Sr. Right. Trump made a deal with Mike Johnson and is sticking to it."  You can tell when Trump talks whether he’s backing someone or not. In this case, I had the misfortune of listening to a long part of that interview about Mike Johnson. It was pretty clear Trump wasn’t interested. He totally agreed with me. And NATO, and he has nice ties. He didn’t say that part, but it was a weak defense. It’s obvious they made some kind of deal. That’s why Trump is on his side. What’s the deal? We still don’t know. But it’s easy to speculate. One possibility is that he got rid of a border law for Trump.  "This is the first part. And he said: 'Of course the election was stolen, sir. Of course, sir. What other lie do you want me to tell, sir? Anything else? I don't know. There might be more deals going on behind the scenes. And if that's the case, I'm sure it'll come out at some point.

from May until August and from what I've heard and read from scoopers is that a significant portion of the movie is going to be reshot a lot of it is going to get cut and replaced and there's some rumors now as to what it was that caused such a disastrous test screening for this movie a new rumor claims that a test screening for Marvel Studios upcoming  Captain America Brave New World did not go well now keep in mind this is rumor speculation I don't have anything to back back this up other than what people are posting but I like johnf Trent from that Park Place here so I think it's worth at least entertaining and looking at because he's he's pretty good so I don't know when this test screening happened I think they had enough to do something I know the film's not completely done shots probably weren't completed stuff like that it's a rough cut  but they apparently showed it to some audiences and they didn't like it at all called it horrible too political which doesn't shock me because if you've seen what was it Falcon and the Winter Soldier you know how political that show got I guarantee you this movie is going to be super political this is going to be well we'll see what happens after the re-shoot but as it is this movie is and apparently test test audiences agreed I've been able to get some insight into what some of the main issues were at the  Captain America Brave New World test screenings apparently audiences were unimpressed by the film's action scenes and the chemistry between cap and his love interest however the biggest issue was how audiences responded to the film's political content you might think this mean audience has found it divisive but it was actually worse than that they found it boring I'm told that the overall feel was that the political material was uninspired and unengaging the audien has found that lacked nuance and was overly expository  and really slowed the movie down I'm also told that while the three sequences that will be removed were a big part of the problem the film's issues go beyond that and more likely include significant rewrites throughout as well as adding removing characters I'm told that Marvel really wants to keep that summer window for re-shoot in order to avoid another release date not just because it mean vacating what they feel is already a good release date for the film but because as usual delaying the film would  result in a domino effect whereby it would mean delaying others and then it goes on to talk about the main character of course Macky and rockmore his love interest having chemistry issues he says take that with a grain of salt though so I'm not shocked by this you know they were going to make this political here's that political scene where he tells that Senator to do better stop calling these people terrorist when they were going around just murdering everybody this a shitty show so I don't see this actually turning into a good  movie but this isn't where their problems stop apparently that blade movie is going to get yet another rewrite I don't see this working out this movie is going to be they just refu what it seems to be because every time they apparently rewrite this and start moving forward with it again and it stops I think him the main actor here uh I think he has some kind of veto powers and can say like I think they really want him and he looks at the script and says it's if that's the case because that's what they've said  before that he didn't like it and he made them retool it what did he do would did he sign on to this movie without seeing a script that's what I've been wondering with this but apparently there's more changes uh they keep trying to push up this like main female character uh either his daughter or a Lilith a bunch of just they want it to be some kind of girl Power movie which is because people want to see a movie about blade not his daughter not some girl vampire Hunter they want to see blade and they keep re it it seems like  they keep rewriting the script so that he's still kind of second fiddle like they don't want to drop it I wonder if he might walk away I think I think you could see it unless he's under some kind of obligation where he can't so he can just keep screwing with him and make him rewrite it till he gets what he wants I don't know but don't worry I don't want you to feel I don't want you to feel that you're not feel like you're not going to have any Marvel don't worry uh iron har and Wonderman are still coming a Marvel  Studios TV boss confirms iron heart and Wonderman survived recent wave of cancellations were adding both of those films as or shows as we speak amazing because everybody everybody's been excited for iron har uh truly a Cornerstone of the Marvel Universe she's what fans have been begging Marvel to give them uh such a loved character same with Wonderman oh Wonderman it's just so well loved and respected it's not even Wonderman they uh a raay swapped him I I think uh the iron the Iron Heart show is probably  going to tie or at least be pretty damn close to the Miss Marvel ratings that nobody watched that Miss Marvel show and I think you're going to see something similar with iron har like nobody gives a about iron har nobody cares about iron har such a stupid replacement for Robert Downey Jr they should have just recast Iron Man they should have just recast Captain America kept Steve Rogers kept Tony Stark but they wanted to move forward with this Marvel now 2016 and they're going to pay for it they're  going to end up having to reboot everything unless the X-Men take off if the Xmen take off then I think that they could Salvage it because you could run a whole MCU on just X-Men if you do it right uh that's what it's really going to come down to the X-Men will make or break the current Marvel Universe uh but these shows aren't going to help uh this dog Captain America movie that's too political apparently which does not Shock Me that they made this overly political and it turned off audiences because I think  audiences are starting to get get sick of this and vote with their wallet look at that magical Society movie that just came out that movie is a catastrophic financial disaster barely made a million dollars uh I'm starting to hear reports that that thing cost about 50 million to make so if we just if we're just generous and say that they did 50 million on marketing uh that's a $100 million and they only made a million back no one's going to see that movie next weekend so I think people are starting to get a little wiser and  they're done P they're done backing this I think people are getting turned off by people are tired of it you never get a break anywhere can't go to a Marvel movie for escapism because you got to get modern day isms and everything now so you know we'll see what happens but anyway let me know what you guys think about all this in the comments below also if you would please

S316	https://youtu.be/Glny4jSciVI?si=0oJ54BJkeVRaC2Re	 Hi, I'm Jamie Foxx. 25 years ago, Quincy Jones gathered an amazing group of artists and musicians to create We Are the World, written by Michael Jackson and Lionel Richie. I'm so proud to be able to share a new version of that song with a video by Academy Award-winning director Paul Haggis. Two weeks ago, we found ourselves surrounded by a dazzling array of artists of all ages, backgrounds, and genres.   but all of whom share a common commitment to take action to help Haiti rise from the rubble and rebuild. As artists, we hope that you enjoy the video and join us in this rare simulcast to millions around the world as we ask you to please do more than just watch. Reach deep into your hearts and give anything you can as we have for Haiti.   Whatever you have, no matter how big or how small, it all counts. Thank you so much and enjoy the video.   There comes a time When we heed a certain call When the world must come together as one There are people dying When it's time to lend a hand to life The greatest gift of all   We can't go on pretending day by day That someone somehow will soon make a change We are all a part of God's great big family And the truth, you know love is all we need   there's a choice we're making we're saving our own lives it's true we'll make a better day just you and me   Send them your heart, oh, so they know that someone cares. So their cries for help will not be in vain. We can't let them suffer. No, we cannot turn away. Right now, they need a helping hand.   We are the children   We are the ones who make a brighter day, so let's start giving There's a choice we're making, we're saving our own lives It's you who make a better day, just you and me We are done and out and there seems no hope at all   But if you just believe, there's nowhere we can fall. Well, well, well, I don't realize all that change can all become when we stand together as one.   We are the world. We are the children. We are the ones who make brighter days. So let's start giving. Let's start giving. There's a choice we're making. We're saving our own lives. And it's true, we make a better day. Just you and me.   We are the ones who make a better day. There's a choice we're making. We're saving our own lives. It's true we make a better day. Just you and me.   There's a choice we're making We're saving our own lives It's true we make a better day Just you and me   We all need somebody that we can lean on. When you wake up, look around and see that your dream's gone. When the earthquakes will help you make it through the storm. When the floor breaks, a magic carpet to stand on. We are the world united by love so strong. When the radio isn't on, you can hear the song. A guiding light on the dark road you're walking on. A sign   We are the world connected by a common bond. Love the whole planet singing along.   Everyday citizens, everybody pitching in. You and I, you and I. 12 days, no water, what's your will to live? Whatever, follow love and watch it multiply. Feeling like the world's end, we can make the world win. Like Katrina, Africa, Indonesia. And now Haiti needs us, they need us, they need us.   We are the children.   Wow. Thank you so much for watching everybody. You know, We Are The World 25 is an opportunity for us to see what we can do to help our fellow man. Haiti right now is in desperate need of our help. And only you can help them. Do what you can. Haiti needs your help. Now. 	Liberal			Conservative	241

S332	https://youtu.be/huvStjScFvM?si=0igfmxqDcCjIHox9	well hey B it's Jamie D me here welcome back to the channel honey listen I want to get into some things and what I want to talk about is this teacher over on Tik Tok who has his students taking down his braids I guess he has a hair appointment of some sort and I want to get into it um I've been saying it swarm all around social media but I have not actually gotten a chance to really check it out wholeheartedly so we're about to do that together okay make sure that you guys are indeed coming into the video  you are liking up the channel okay subscribing to the channel as well if you're not subscribed and make sure that you're cutting on your notification Bells okay so without further Ado let us go ahead and hop into this video to see exactly what uh this teacher has to say about this um let's check it out stream my students helping me take my hair out there was quite the discourse in the chat which had people saying this was inappropriate and other people saying this was completely fine there was nothing wrong with what I was doing and  people were just making it weird so of course I had to bring this issue to the big stage I would like to represent myself in this case your honor if I may number one for little context I had a hair appointment immediately after school and I needed my hair taken out beforehand I would have taken it out the night before but that Friday we had a camera crew coming in to shoot a promotional video and I was one of the ones being interviewed so I had to look presentable so I didn't take my hair out I didn't have the time to do it  all myself cuz it would have taken me forever so naturally I asked about four or five of my over over a 100 best friends to assist me in taking my hair out and they all agreed number two this was at the end of class this week we were doing stem fair presentations since it was Friday and all of my students did an excellent job on their stem fair projects and presentations I told them if we get one solid presentation in this class I'll end class a little early and they can have fun and play basketball  darts or be on their phones or whatever and during that time my team would help me take my hair out a couple of these were students from my class but others were students from other classes I would all of them a pass at the beginning of the class period requesting their assistance 10 minutes before dismissal I told the teachers only send them if all of their work was completed and they had good behavior they all met the criteria so 10 minutes before dismissal they showed up for their job my next point I  like to make is if I was a female teacher those people wouldn't be in the comments saying oh this is weird this is inappropriate cuz me personally I don't think there's anything weird about this people are saying oh that's too intimate to me it's literally just hair it doesn't have to be weird some people have never had cool teachers in the shows I personally believe that building authentic relationships with students is Paramount in being an Effective Teacher I make sure my students know and can  feel that I care about them beyond the schoolwork and all the stuff that I have to make them do I take the time to get to know my students outside of academics because caring for the whole child is what's important some of these students have been with me since I was was a substitute 4 years ago they see me as a big brother or a father figure as some of them say and me I don't want kids of my own so all of these kids are literally my children and in case you're wondering about their parents most of  them follow me on social media and always talk about my videos with their kids they always tell me that they're so grateful that their kids have someone like me in their life and my admin they're well aware of my social media presence and they love my videos to me this is just another wholesome moment that I'm having with my kids that I was fortunate enough to catch on film since I'm a science teacher one thing that I teach my students about is symbiosis symbiosis deals with the relationships between organisms the type of  relationship that I like to Foster in my class is mutualism or mutualistic relationship which means both organisms benefit from The Exchange so when my students have good behavior complete all their assignments and do everything that a scholar is supposed to do I reward them with downtime and just time to just be a kid be on their phones play games gossip so on and so forth my students and I work hard and we play harder I'm fortunate enough to have students that feel safe and comfortable around me safe  to come to me with their problems their frustrations they come to me seeking guidance and wisdom or come to me simply to chill and hang out because they know that they have a safe space to be themselves around me what I strive to do as an educator is be the teacher I wish I had grown up I strive to be the teacher that makes my inner child happy someone that my inner child would be proud of I want to be the teacher that my students reflect back on 20 30 years down the line and think like dang that  teacher I had in middle school he was the no further questions your honor so let me know your thoughts in the comments you think this was inappropriate or people are making something out of nothing and although you are entitled to your opinion all I ask is that you be resp respectful thank you all right so y'all just got a chance to check out that video and you know when I first saw it um my initial thought was like oh this is so inappropriate like what the hell does he think he doing and you know after I  listened to this video just now um nothing has changed I still feel the same goddamn way I felt the first time you could play however much classical music you want to play and talk as soft as you want to talk but in my personal this is uh inappropriate um I feel like everything that he said he was on point with um you know the relationships between students and teachers but then also when you allow students to get this comfortable in spaces it could lead to inappropriate behavior or misunderstandings of some sort um in my  personal and you know he talks about you know I feel like a lot of you people may have never had a cool teacher and I understand that but then at the same time a lot of people have had cool teachers in the school and a lot of times not all but quite a bit of the times those cool teachers have been caught up in rumors of them doing inappropriate things with students so why would you want to put yourself in a position for that to possibly happen where somebody could put these allegations out there on you and then  some of the videos like this they use against you in court at some point you know what I'm saying um and you know how one would set it up you know in court or whatever they can all easily turn a simple video as a lot of people may view it like this one into something that's extremely like salacious or whatever we see it all the time with media but um yeah I I I'm just I understood what he was saying and it was really the soft classical music and you listening and it's like okay I see what you're saying but no my dog  like that's still inappropriate um to me I just can't and I'm not going to let my child take nobody hair down especially a stranger if you ain't going to pay like run my kid their coins what this supposed to be for extra credit or some something or something like what is we why what was the purpose of even filming this and putting this off on social media and see the other thing for me is it's the students identity what if I'm a parent who don't post my child on social media and what if I'm trying to you know  conceal the school that my child goes to and you're over here putting them on display on social media like I kind of feel way about that you know even though he tried to you know answer that too and say most of my students or some of my students parents know that I put them on social media yeah I hear you say that but do we know that those children's parents know that you put them on social media you see what I'm saying um I probably would have felt the way if I would have saw that video and that was  my child in the video like what the like explain this situ why you got my child taking your hair down like what is that about you ain't give me no call ahead of time I understand it was like at the last few minutes of class and these are some of the good students some of my best students are the ones that I had come and they were so great in school they were so fantastic that I chose them to take my hair down like m I feel like that's still giving a bit of tacky in my personal I do feel like um  in my personal it was just it was inappropriate I understand that you're on crunch time and I understand that you have a hair appointment and things that you need to get done but I also feel like you should have did it yourself okay I hate to say it like I mean or just pay a five pay the five if you can afford to pay the five pay the five and just have somebody just had a person take your hair down on you get there to get your hair done you know um it did you know as I I mean to me it did kind of look a bit innocent as  I'm watching and I'm listening to him talk you know um but at the same time as innocent as it may have seem with the young ladies taking the hair down it still seemed a bit inappropriate especially for you to want to film it for social media and put them on display like that's my biggest thing like what if somebody's trying not to let everybody know what school they child attends and you got they ass all on social media like did you get clearance for that was there a letter that sent that was sent home for the parents that  was an approval of oh hey um can we get your permission you know sometimes what we like to do is we like to film um you know Tik toks and just want to get your approval that it's okay for your child to be filmed on Tik Tok like I ain't like that um and then another thing he said that a lot of my students see me as a big brother this that that and the other um that's a lot that's not all you don't know how those kids may see you you know a lot of times I do feel like you have older people teachers and stuff  who are just trying to be kind to you know the students or whatnot and they may take that kindness in a different type of way it's been plenty of times I know when I was in school around their age I would hear some of my friends and others have a crush on one of the handsome teachers in school or whatever not that the teacher will ever cross the line with them but you know doing little stuff like this make them feel like oh I probably got a chance or whatever ain't no telling what's going on with these  people heads so in these in these kids heads I just feel like when it's a situation like this in my personal I just um let's lower these type of conversations from happening by not engaging in this type of stuff I mean you know that's just like I just I don't know y'all I I mean I understand how people want to water it down and say oh you know it's just hair it's really not that big of a deal like it's not that deep but as soon as y'all come out with something soon as something happen or pop off y'all will be using this very  video as a reference to explain said person's poor Behavior you know what I'm saying like y'all should have known when y'all saw this D if this man got caught up in some stuff in the past or anything in the future this is going to be a video used to reference any allegations like you know and then I feel like I know you're trying to be you know a great person to these students a teacher that cares about them outside of school and all of that and I get that and I do think we need teachers like that but at  the same time I feel like if you're if you got them taking your hair down in class what other things do you have them doing that makes them feel a bit too comfortable to where if it came down to a situation of getting themselves or or you out of trouble they'll like they may just throw some allegations out there on you and then now you're having to defend yourself like I just yeah I can't let it fly for me you know I mean but if that's what everybody else feels and that's how y'all Rock like it's not that deep it's just hair  and if you people that are saying it's just hair have children and you feel like you'll be okay with then cool um if you're a person that probably don't have no kids and you looking at it like hey you know um I think nothing's wrong with that well then maybe when you have your child you might feel the same or you might feel differently I know me as a parent I don't want no like that okay I don't want my child taking your hair down okay I feel like you can be a friend to a student and also have clear  clear lines for them to know that I'm your teacher okay don't get too friendly with me think you going to come over here and take my hair down or none of that like it's a way to be cool and then it's also a way to you know draw the line just like you know as being a parent knowing that you are you know in a position of authority but also at the same time like not being too um I guess uh I don't want to say harsh but harsh of a lack of lack of better word not being too distant with your kid that  they can't have honest conversations with you and all of that so it's just like really I I just I for me as a parent I would not want my child taking down a teacher's hair uh male or female okay um son or daughter meaning teacher meaning whether the teacher is a woman whether the teacher is a man whether my child is a girl but what I don't want them participating in that and I damn sure don't want nobody putting my child on social media as you're sitting there what it looks like your School logo on  it so people know like I mean I think that's my biggest issue and that's crazy because it's really bigger than them taking down the hair in a sense it's like like how you know these parents really want their child on camera and then it being on display where they child go to school at like I don't know I don't really like this but I'm going let y'all do what y'all want to do cuz y'all going to do it do that anyway cuz how y'all is hello but y'all leave y thoughts in comments down below and let me know whether you felt like it was  that big of a deal whether you felt like it wasn't a big that big of a deal and keep in mind this my personal my personal ain't your personal okay and that's okay don't be trying to attack me girl for my personal cuz I don't see stuff the way that you do understand and I'm probably never going to see it the same way but that's just where we at all right so you guys leave your thoughts and comments down below I'm Jamie that's me uh follow me on Instagram and Twitter at Jamie that's me and I will catch you  guys in the next one bye-bye my city
