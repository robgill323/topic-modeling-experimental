hearts so thank you again uh you had an experience with Chanel today okay you want to talk about that so I was cleaning out the garage and I have a box full of purses right like bags I've had them in the garage in a container in a container for two years yeah and I kind of forgot about him uhhuh and uh someone said well you know like talking about bags and I'm like well I've had them in the garages like anybody could                      have stole them right I'm like yeah I have so many Chanel bags and um they're like they've gone up in price I'm like oh wow so I went we were cleaning out the garage and I pull out one of my Chanel show show well this isn't I'll show you the the picture this is another one which they can't redo so oh they can't fix that one well no this one's not this one's in good condition this doesn't have any issues I just need to get it cleaned but I also had this in the bucket right so I had um two Chanel                      bags and I'm like wow I'm like this looks almost fake legit this Chanel bag I purchased I don't even know how many years ago I think maybe 2010 I think it was $4500 for I think 14 years ago I paid this caviar jumbo bag 4 00 I remember yeah and I bought another one $4,500 but they don't make it the last one was 2012 so I take I take it to Chanel bag and I'm like this honestly I pulled it out and the whole thing was discolored yeah and the like the chain the chain this chain was is gold right I'll show you the picture and it was all                      discolored mhm and this part right here is gold and it was all discolored yeah so I take it and I had no idea that these bags inside have a little sticker inside and it they punch in the sticker it's right in right there that's a serial number right I had no idea that was a serial number yeah so they go in there just two people in there and they type it in this computer and it shows whether it's authentic or not mhm and so she goes in there and she's like um yeah this bag is worth 12,500 I was like oh my God you paid                      $4500 for it I paid $4,500 for it it's a solid investment in something you can wear whenever you want I had no I had these like I had all these purses yeah thrown I mean I have more than this by the way well listen you're doing well for yourself you have bags you forgot about that are worth thousands and thousands of dollars sitting in the garage but this is the this is the kicker uh-huh so I take it to them and this zipper I bought this Chanel but they don't make it anymore and the zipper all rotted like                      crazy and that's probably because I had it in a bin right by the ocean and the ocean probably took care of it I don't know because I didn't take care of it right they're like to get the full zipper for that bag that was made in 2012 it's going to cost me $200 to get that zipper replaced okay okay for it's not that's not bad for a $12,000 no that's another one that was the other bag oh how much is that bag worth so this bag how much is that bag worth uh no this bag is worth 12,500 too no but the one that you're getting the                      zipper for I don't know they could because they don't make it anymore oh but it's probably worth many thousands it's many thousands they don't make it anymore okay it's worth many many many probably worth more more because they don't make it they don't make anym yeah it's like vintage now yeah right but to get that other one fix yeah it's going to cost me $510 it's going to cost me $510 but wait I have vintage Chanel bags with Gold Hardware from legit from like the 80s and it hasn't worn off well it might be where you kept it                      it was in a garage it was at the beach for a year that the air there is very destructive the salt and the it's just it's that air you saw what it did to everything we had outside everything got rusted well I have a little problem buying Chanel and I'll tell you why so I bought these pearls yeah okay from Chanel uhhuh and I went and if you spray they're not real pearls they're not like I bought them from the Chanel store did did they advertise them as real or did you no they're everything there is cosmetic                      like not cosmetic uh costume uhhuh so I I take it there and they're like yeah it's going to um we can't uh fix this and I'm like what do you mean you can't fix my pearls that I got here that were legit $4,500 come on swear to God and they said they can't fix it they can't fix no I swear to you she the perfume rots the the enamel of they costume I'm like I will never ever ever buy Chanel costume jewelry ever again see there you have it that's the kind of thing you get on the daily smash you get amazing                      advice hints from Kelly tips from Kelly yeah they can help you in life that's you're better off going and getting a fake piece of Chanel jewelry yeah legit like honest to God going to Chinatown and buying fake Chanel jewelry I'm not kidding you because they cannot replace it's I'm flabbergasted by that okay we have to we have more things to talk about okay so including the fact that we're about to be separated for the first time in our since we got married since before we got married five years ago almost five years                      ago it feels like we're still we're going to be in different places and and and I'm sad about it but I also am excited for you and Jolie to have a great time on this trip yeah great mother daughter experience but logistically all next week we're going to be on opposite sides of the pond we're going to have to come up with a a crafty way of putting a show together if we're going to do this how are we going to do this I don't know I mean I guess you can send me travel you can send me uh like a video log of your experiences over there                      and I can just kind of introduce the clips yeah we can we can do Kelly and we can do a z a zoom and we can do a zoom and we can you can sort of sum up your your experiences there every day MH and I can show what I'm doing in the Hamptons and in in the city yeah okay so that's what we're going to do next week also wanted to mention this week on the Rick and Kelly show on patreon.com our interview with Jill xaron uh she has predicted no more ultimate girls trips and Kelly disagrees with that I do want to share One Clip                      and then we'll get to Kelly's thoughts what about Bethany Frank on her her Bravo Reckoning would you weren't part of that I am I mean you mean part of I mean I'm not suing anybody but I absolutely support it 100% I think she's 100% right you agree with her and the irony is she has nothing to gain because she was she was not wronged financially if anything she gained financially I I was I appreciate the fact that she's willing to go out on a limb for everybody else who's going to benefit after her I still believe even                      there's no lawsuit and nothing happens from the reality Reckoning per se they are all treating you differently now I mean I'm not on Bravo but I guarantee you they are getting treated better because of that Reckoning they're all afraid of being sued now like I agree with that and Bethany doesn't have anything to gain she already gained she already won she is going out on a limb to help she is I I think she would gain herself financially from residual ual if they won that battle she would also gain                      in notoriety and and respect from all the other Housewives if she is able to win for them that's you know that's something well then she should do a class action lawsuit I think that's what they were talking about doing but I don't know if they actually ever came up with one I mean I mean that's sort of anyway she also predicted that there would be no more ultimate girls trips and you do you agree with that or no I you know I think they lost financials Big Time listen they they they spent $250,000 on each person not only that                      not only the talent but could you imagine going to Morocco the production in the production and the the you have to pay for the the cameramen the sound people you have to pull everybody up hotels air hotels airfare security I mean it must be a many millions many millions of and then all of a sudden the product isn't going to I mean that had to that had to devastate them finan for sure because you expect to get a big return on that that's a big chunk of airtime and you can play it in many countries                      over and over again that's why Bethany wanted residuals cuz they make money on top of the money people are coming to me from Moscow and like Paris and like and they're like oh my God we're now watching your Ireland trip which was yeah that's nuts eight years ago Bravo makes money on that and Bravo makes money on that so they spend all those millions and they lose all those Millions if this thing doesn't air and it probably won't it's not going to so then then the argument is amongst you know the                      executives or whatever well do we spend Millions more and run the risk of the same thing happening again because it could happen on any show at any time an incident between two cast members that one of them decides they didn't welcome and all of a sudden it's harassment or assault you know anybody could sue at any time like Shannon bador could sue she's like you know what this is a hostile work environment you purposefully got Alexis and John to come on to harass me this is a this is a a hostile working you know better than                      anyone if if you really want to get down and dirty I mean listen you signed up for this this is a reality show m um these women that are doing this is want just want a little payout sure uh I find it asinine for these girls to ruin it for everybody else but it is a different playing field like they've been playing by different rules for a long time and I guess I guess what's happening now is the rules that the rest of the world is forced to live with are now starting to be applied to the housewives to this                      reality shows then then then Andy Cohen should play by the rules of every other industry of of a big Corporation but they can't because NBC Universal made him too big right they they put him on all they put them on all the re they put them on all the Housewives reunions they should have had somebody else doing that they they they put all their eggs in one basket with Andy Cohen they did indeed they should have had a other people if they were you know but I agree with Jill Aaron I think that this is coming to a close it's                      coming to a head um I think there is probably you know if if if I were like Amazon or some other you know WGN or any of those other I be like let's get some of that other talent that are normal and put them on our shows that could happen who knows I mean I I already made my prediction that his days were numbered but I could be wrong but we're going to keep an eye on it I don't think Andy c number I don't think his days are numbered because he he's too they put they made him too big they they they put                      too much investment in one person yeah but if he if he broke the rules in a way that they can't put up with anymore if they can't justify it if there are lawsuits that are being filed that they're going to have to settle or go to court on that involve him and if it it it can get to a point you don't think Bill Riley was too big to be fired it took many many lawsuits but eventually he was out the door and he was their number one earner and they paid him $25 million a year and you would think he was too big to fail same with Matt low I                      guess a lot of those guys even Roger alss he created that Network and then he he was shown the door like the boss you do enough wrong things eventually it comes back to bite you yeah you hear that P Diddy allegedly uh we have a lot more to get to okay I I don't know what your run down was today I was I know CU yeah I was I was busy today getting my Chanel stuff I wanted to read some fun comments from the the cooking with Kelly segment with Harry the beef wellington we posted it on YouTube it was from our patreon and many                      thousands of you watched it thank you and Beach guys 7415 said wow what a great show great production and editing Kelly you are looking smoking hot hot hot oh thank you God lose some weight I take some vitamins and Bam I got hit on today oh no at Cafe R&D so this is what happens when I'm not around and now she's leaving for a week so what do you think's going to happen in Paris and London I'm with my kid we're going to that's not going to stop them they're going to be on you like oh you're silly                      no no one's doing anything trust me lnz in orbit one word prodigy talking about Harry Prodigy ccs for you said could you use a coffee grinder for the mushrooms maybe or some other chopping device I look I like cooking but that seemed like a lot of chopping uh well we've done a lot of research on the uh what what are they called they called duck duck duck D duck duck cell duck cells and you cannot put them through a food processor because it makes a paste you legit have to chop them because of the consistency like I                      guess if you put them through a food process or even a pulse yeah it doesn't it it screws up with the consistency of it John putty 3523 looked delicious but too raw in the middle for me when we first took it out it was it was very red and we decided to put it back in yeah and we cooked that one for a few more minutes Becky McBain that's a process but enjoyed watching Marilyn Huntley said Kelly you are so blessed to have a friend like Harry and a husband like Rick I am I am so blessed I don't know what I did to                      deserve like oh honey a great family a great kid a husband I have great mom and dad I have wonderful wonderful people people like you MH I get such nice comments

not victimless this a little complicated but I it caught my eye because John Stewart is now facing backlash because he was he did a whole bit on Donald Trump's real estate Empire and on how overvaluing his properties which is what he was accused of in the New York case was not a victimless crime Stewart's point was that uh was that he benefits and others don't benefit John Stewart                      said how is he he said these are not victimless crimes he said money isn't infinite a loan that goes to the liar doesn't go to someone who's giving a more honest evaluation so the system becomes incentivized for corruption so okay John Stewart it turns out sold his 6280 ft Tribeca duplex for $17.5 million 10 years ago 17.5 million 10 years ago but the how much is it worth now the estimated market value value was 1.8 million and the actual assessor valuation was $847,000 so John Stewart was paying                      significantly lower property taxes calculated based on the assessor valuation price which is exactly what he called out Trump for doing instead of paying taxes on a $17 million Penthouse he was paying taxes on a less than $2 million Penthouse or with the in one case $847,000 P he was glad to pay lower taxes on that that's was a hypocrite on and he's going after Trump for doing the same thing on his properties we hope you guys have a smash tastic day have a smash tastic day everybody and and we are going to have a                      smash on Friday uh that will be pre-recorded before Kelly leaves town so we hope you watch Friday and thank you for

J8	https://www.youtube.com/live/YMtPh6RwjWA?si=BryRB-sqg52Zn-FZ	           e all right guys thank you for joining me tonight as per usual I appreciate it so tonight we're going to we're talking about the the supposed bad feelings about a lot of shit that's going on it seems like as I've said before I think other channels have said this that we we have definitely we are definitely seeing a lot of shit uh start to ramp up anyway mosar Dolby Lisa Lisa Johnny what's going on man uh Ozark prepper buy the book Ozark negro double Q's thank you for the 5x5 Catgirl Undead Joe Laura Williams Eric Leona

you for the 5x5 and okay that should be it Joanne Kitty and Scott thank you for the 5x5 and moose MP that should be it all right all right so as I've said before I think a lot of channels have said this it's like we wake up every day and there's something new and it's like the the hits keep coming uh a lot of us heard about the barge that crashed in the I forgot what bridge that was it didn't take the bridge out but it's they slammed right into it and it was a I think it was a failed attempt some                      people still think it was an accident whatever uh two guys in what one week time or week and a half time that is not a coincidence nonetheless you're going to need something a lot bigger stronger to knock these down now I wouldn't be surprised if we we started seeing a certain style of attacks on Bridges taking Bridges completely out but uh oh uh Mike I'm going to do the illegal immigrant thing probably next week I I have enough actually I might be able to get away with it tomorrow I'll find the locations                      there in and it'll it'll be during the day and it'll be quick it'll be like 20 minutes a half hour long provided I can find the the the location for it and make enough time to do it I am going to see the eclipse I changed my mind I said I was going to stay local but when I looked at the weather supposedly the clouds in the sky so I'm going to be traveling out west well not out west but like Northwest to either Old Forge or Watertown New York so again uh decided to changeed my night my my mind sorry on the entire                      endeavor I am sorry I am curious as to how this is going to turn out so and I'm and I'm looking to see the eclipse like I mean it's a Once in a-lifetime thing I'm also photographer so I do have that that aspect of wanting to you know see the eclipse for myself so it should be interesting now I know that there there's a call for a lot of different shit to going down uh I'll just be ready for whatever they throw at us whatever might happen uh hopefully if the skies are clear and I I read it by Monday that                      they are clear well rather Sorry by Saturday if I read the skies are clear here in the city I'm going to stay in the city but if it's still going to be cloudy or clouds in the sky I'm not going to take my chances I'm going to take my ass uh Upstate New York somewhere or closer to the totality uh Eclipse I am prepared to stay for at least a night wake up first thing in the morning 2: in the morning and then head into work uh Insight of Michael I think I got your you sent it to me in an email I think                      right I think it was an email I did get it I didn't get a chance to watch it yet if that's you you have your channel right it's a channel you have um yeah either way just let me know but with that being said guys there's a lot of other things going on so we have the first transmission of as they put it bird cow the human of the Aven flu we have ai looking to rip us a new one apparently there's a committee that met on AI I'm going to read the article in a little bit and they are sounding the alarm on how bad or rather                      where AI can go and how it could lead to our demise and not even just a small demise like taking us out but a like an extinction level threat to human to the human race and of course guys we've all seen this movie it was called Terminator uh yeah John Connor saved the world supposedly well not so much saved the world but in the Terminator Universe he delayed the outcome now there is a Terminator alternate universe where he stops the apocalypse and everybody goes on living their their normal life but                      there's also another uh alternative Universe where it doesn't doesn't stop it it just delays it by like a decade or some shit like that but anyway AI looking to definitely uh rape and Robb us at a moment's notice we also have and I know a lot of you are going to uh appreciate this but here in New York City there was a big to-do with three migrants who were arrested during a raid on a New York City home and inside the home they had guns drugs and they were squatting in an in in a home so they were squatting in a home they were                      running drugs and guns out of the home these same three migrants were arrested previously and got away not got away sorry the the the no bail thing they were set loose so they was set loose back to do it all over again now if anybody knows anything about drugs guns and homes that is an operation if you will by a migrant gang it's unclear which gang it was when I read the article maybe I skimmed over it but nonetheless that's definitely the beginnings of a migrant gang set setting up operations in New York City but you                      will not only see it in New York City you will see it in the rest of the country so there is that to contend with um also guys I'm giving you a fair warning Prime prepper thank you for the donation um I'm also giving you guys a fair warning that do yourself a favor and be prepared for power outage if you live near the totality Eclipse path supposedly everybody going there is undoubtedly going to um drain the system and you should be ready for a blackout I'm taking my uh solar generators with me they'll be fully charged and they                      usually last about five four to 5 days depending on the use so I'll be okay if I get stuck out there for that long I should only be out there for a night hopefully by 2: 3 in the morning traffic would have let up and I'll be able to fucking whiz back into the city I know a lot of people like what kind of morons travel thousands of miles or hundreds of miles to go see an eclipse that's only going to last 4 minutes this idiot again because I have the whole photography background is why I'm going out there if I didn't have                      this background I would not be traveling this far to go see a 4minute event right at the peak of it it's 4 minutes rather sorry uh no you're not supposed to look at the eclipse there is a moron online saying look at it I have glanced at a solar eclipse once again I glanced at it I looked up and was like looked away and I was able to see it for like 2 3 seconds so I'm not blind but I am not advocating or telling anyone else to do that because if you go blind that shit is on you so guys later tonight on the angry                      truth Channel we're going to talk we're going to talk about a dangerous Trend that is starting up and I

you will a boot camp it was pretty good there were a lot of                      people there there might be more people there as well you learn a lot of shit at this this event a lot of the events I go to you learn a lot of shit so keep that in mind I will be mentioning for foreseeable uh until the event comes up for the adult pass guys if you want to get $32 off use code Henry Sarah Adam to David and for the three-day pass you're using Henry Sarah Adam 3 David not two but three David and the youth passes guys they're like 15 bucks a ticket and that uh code is Henry Sam young                      23 so so there's a lot of there's going to be a lot of speakers out there again last year was still good and it rained it rained almost the whole weekend so uh let's see where I can let's see where I can pick this up this uh without destroying my fucking live stream if I'm not mistaken it's I think it's in Ohio I'm like a th% sure it's in Ohio uh but we'll see I think they have Dave Canterbury he might be speaking there he was supposed to speak last year but he didn't show up uh not and he's right down the road from this to be so                      it's in Ohio it's in Ohio but let me get the exact address cuz this is a good time if you don't let's see but um yes guys I'll be attending more of these throughout the year so as they come up as I'm invited will be uh turning out to these things you know what I don't have the address I will get it for you in the next live stream next week but I'm not going to sit here and look for it because for some reason it should be like on the homepage but it's not again unless I'm missing something I am quite retarded so there is that                      possibility I'm not reading it right but it is in Ohio but other other than that guys just go to I'm going to put the link in the chat you guys will take a look at it and if somebody finds the address please let me know all right it's in the chat so it's uh yeah it just says Gathering May 17 so it's May 17th through the 19th of this year again if I'm not mistaken Canonbury might be showing up to this year he was supposed to be there last year a couple people bailed last year because of the rain and                      it rained the whole weekend and they still had a decent turnout so again if it's it should be nice this year we should be able to get uh a better turnout or she should be able to get a better turnout me myself I'm going I'm just wandering around I'm not speaking I'm not doing anything like that I'm just going to be the wandering idiot as if you will so this guy showed up last year I wonder if he's uh the fucking the black self-defense guy I forgot his name he was there last year I think he might be showing up this                      year yeah you might get the address when you purchase the tickets but um I should definitely get that information from her anyway let's get on with the show this is really bothering me that like either I'm missing it or it's not on here but I know it's in Ohio so if you go to the website you should be able to find it anyway enough of that let's get on with the show so guys uh we're going to talk about AI first and their their extinction level threat to the human race apparently the United States is                      looking to intervene they had a committee that's looking to intervene they a lot of people are super nervous about it in fact the people who created AI super nervous about it they're like yo yeah Vision that might be uh Hawking Hills that sounds very familiar it's where the Negroes roam no I'm just kidding but um Chris said put the the address in there old school survival event venue address is Venton County that's it Fairgrounds so Chris put it in the uh the chat MC Arthur Ohio that's it that sounds way more                      familiar and Shadow said M Authur as well thank you guys appreciate it that's the address cuz I remember that's the the the venue uh yeah so it's uh it's Venton County Fairgrounds 31471 Ohio 93 macauthur macauthur Ohio all right guys so a new report commissioned by the United States Department paints an alarming picture of the catastrophic National Security risks posed by rapidly evolving artificial intelligence warning that time is running out for the federal government to avert a disaster now I watched a couple of                      movies and there was another one on Netflix the one where they use the stacks to change into bodies forgot the name of that Ultra carbon and in ultracarbon they mentioned a war with AI and how AI lost and AI was after that Outlaw so this reminds me of that and that we're headed in that direction and we are definitely either a mimic TV shows or TV shows had the foresight to mimic what's going to happen to us or tell what's going to happen to us rather the findings were based on an interview with more than 2,000 people over more                      than a year including top executive from leading AI companies cyber security researchers weapons of mass destruction experts and National Security officials inside the government the report released this week by Gladstone AI motherfucker flatly stated that the most advanced AI system could in worst case scenario pose an extinction level threat to the human species a United States Department official confirmed by to CNN that the agency commissioned a report as it constantly assesses how AI is aligned                      with the goal to protect the United States interest at home and abroad however the officials stress the report does not represent the views of the United States government the warning in the report is another reminder that although the potential of AI continues to Captivate investors and the public there's a real danger to it AI is already an economically transformative technology it allows sorry it could allow us to cure disease make scientific discoveries and overcome challenges we once thought were                      insurmountable says Jeremy Harris CEO and co-founder of Gladstone AI these people are foreseeing the future and the shit we headed and the shit Hills the shit storm that we're headed into with AI and for some reason they keep talking about this or rather they keep trying to develop it and make it better I don't know or understand why people would choose to keep developing something that's ultimately going to end us all most of us that is anyway all right all right all right but it brings a serious risk                      including catastrophic risk that we need to be aware of a growing body of evidence including Empirical research and Analysis published in the world's top AI conference suggest that suggests that above a certain threshold of capacity AI could potentially become uncontrollable no shit it's called Skynet and Skynet said fuck these humans and wiped us out from the planet most of us White House spokesperson Robin Patterson said President Joe Biden's executive order on AI is the most significant action any                      government in the world has taken to seize the promise and manage the risk of artificial intelligence of course Biden didn't think of this shit himself he's still thinking about ice cream and shit so other than that guys they're worried about safety concerns the AI uh the the the Gladstone AI company they came up with this report but they are also a AI developer if I'm not mistaken so I I find it interesting that they're sort of shooting themselves in the foot but they must listen the one thing                      about AI guys that people don't understand the one thing about AI is that these people know way more than we do as far as what AI can do and how AI can eliminate us and that being said guys we're not being told a half we're not being told to half about a lot of shit we're not being told to half about what what's what the government is really thinking about the eclipse um if the eclipse is going to be anything significant we'll start to see more natural disasters like more earthquakes more weirder weather                      anomalies the closer we get to the eclipse right so we saw that earthquake in wherever the fuck was Taiwan right right we saw that earthquake there that was pretty bad I don't know what the de toll is up to but I'm pretty sure one of you guys are going to tell me I'm curious to see where it got up to but guys bottom line is that the everybody's worried about AI uh the Harris Harris at Gladstone AI Executives said unprecedented level of access his team had to to officials in the public and private sector led to startling                      conclusions this is the more important part right here the safety concern Gladstone AI said it spoke to Technical and Leadership teams from chat chat GPT owner open AI Google deep dream Facebook parent meet meta and anthropic all sorry anthropic along the way we learned that some sobering things Harris said behind the scenes the Safety and Security situation in advanced AI seems pretty inadequate relative to the National Security risk that AI May introduce fairly soon now one theory is that AI could have access to                      every last nuclear Silo on the planet on the planet and the idea is that if it can make its way into every Silo it can launch every missile haphazardly or just launch the missile far enough that it gets above ground of that area and explodes putting us into a Mad Max scenario if every last nuclear weapon that's attached to the system detonates Gladstone AI reports that a competitive pressure are pushing companies to accelerate development of AI at the expense of Safety and Security raising the prospect that most advanced                      AI systems could be stolen and weaponized against the United States now I mentioned that a couple weeks ago about AI being weaponized and people like it's already weaponized no it's not not even close what you think is weaponized right now it is not weaponized yet when it becomes weaponized guys I think and and when it becomes weaponized and self-aware those two have to coincide and or match for it to become a full threat philanthropic I said that didn't I say philanthropic or did I say that wrong too anyway                      um that is the problem guys and the fact that we're watching companies try to beat one another out and who has the faster smartest AI but then turn around and go yo AI is going to whip Us in the dick you're like if it's going to kill us then why are we why are we still developing it because we have to for the greater good of mankind for the greater good this thing is going to greater good us into a greater and for some reason they keep developing it I don't understand the stupidity of the human race the human                      race is has gone full retard they've gone so full retard that they're pushing something that can possibly wipe us off the map and they're still pushing through with it they're like fuck it we'll take our chances we'll just hit the off switch all right fucko so be it when you're glowing in the fucking dark don't say that none of us morons didn't warn you because we watched The Matrix we watched Terminator and it did not work out well for the humans I do not want to go to sleep in a fucking tube of jelly bullheaded and                      fucking you know hungry all the time cuz the fucking things decided to yeah but um yeah and so with that guys um AI is definitely going to backfire on the human race now this is the last part of the article before I get to the bird flu nonsense that I'm going to tell you right now I'm not worried about and I'll tell you why but hold on how could AI backfire on humans a related document published by again Gladstone AI warn that the development of AGI and the capabilities approaching AGI which if                      I'm not mistaken AGI is a more advanced AI system and I didn't realize that so they they started calling it AGI and I'm like what the fuck does that mean there is an acronym for AGI I'm pretty sure I missed it but whatever all right would introduce okay so the development of AGI and capabilities approaching AGI would introduce catastrophic risk unlike anything the United States has ever face amounting to a wmd like risk if they were all weaponized I just said that about 5 minutes ago that's why I said it's not                      weaponized yet it has to be weaponized and self-aware for it to be weaponized and self-aware then we're definitely running into some problems so um sorry I'm reading reading some of the chat all right so uh any of you mods whoever deleted or blocked uh Johnny three wait's comment it was a harmless comment please don't do that again he's just joking around um so anyway a simple verbal or typed command like execute an untraceable Cyber attack to crash North America's electric grid could yield a response of such quality                      as to prove catastrophically effective an untraceable Cyber attack in fact guys I'll take it a step further AI can absolutely falsify a Cyber attack by stating that by stating that artificial gay int fucking guys whatever uh by stating that Russia did it the Chinese did it some fucking home and Guam did it so AI could be smart enough to do that now I told you guys before I said it again the one thing I I I I understand AI by from what I'm reading and I understand his capabilities of what we've seen in                      movies I put the two and two together I do more research and I find out guys that AI can weaponize itself to a point where it can absolutely start building its own robots to assassinate the human race it could start coming up with a formula that is 100% effective to wipe out the human race there's a lot of things that AI is Cap can be capable of doing in the future right now not so much in the future yes and the thing is we are limiting ourselves by dampening our imagination you have to imagine every                      possible Avenue of anything that can happen with AI to be able to fight AI to fight AI guys you have to be broad thinking you can't be tunnel vision and go oh that's not going to happen that can't happen don't do that we have to be able to think broadly so that we know exactly what it is but um yeah anyway so um with that being said AI guys is definitely a risk I think it's a risk in the couple of years I don't think we're definitely going to see anything you know now we got too many other things to contend with in                      fact AI is probably lying in the cut being like yo let's wait till these idiots start to calm down and start relaxing and thinking everything's okay and then boom we'll hit him with some bullshit you know like AI could be that smart the reason why the part of the reason why 911 happened whether it was an inside job or not part of the reason why it happened is because we had a lack of an imagination and as far as the human race keeps having a lack of imagination guys a lot of things are going to happen a lot of curveballs are                      going to catch you off guard you're going to be surprised but if you have a very active imagination you won't be surprised at what comes next or what can possibly come next sorry so guys with that let's head into the first case of bird cow human transmission of bird flu in Texas so let me start up by saying guys that the bird flu is highly patogen but it is it's also highly contagious but it's hard for humans to get you got to all but lick another dude's tongue or chick's tongue to get it and or they                      have to sneeze like directly in their mouth is not as contagious as one would think I thought it was it was really it's deadly especially for the old and young but uh and the US range I don't know what US range are the middle age range uh we could fight it off again depending on how healthy you are now the bird flu also known as the highly pathogenic Aven flu or the hpai is back and this time it's fuck no I'm just kidding it said it's back like it was a movie it's back and this time it's infecting Dairy herds across several                      States for the first time there also a report that a Texas dairy worker tested positive for the virus I think they tested a lot of the now here's the problem how did the Dairy Farmer get unless he was drinking the milk or he got milk in his M or he fucked the cow I don't know how he would have gotten it unless the cow sneezed in his face like you know or is it that um is it that contagious but from what I just read a couple minutes ago it's contagious but it's hard to get and I don't know why they that it's highly contagious sorry                      but it's hard for humans to get or or transfer from one another unless it mutates within the human and becomes easily um transferable or transmittable sorry then we definitely have a problem at least old people have a problem anyway on Friday that was to that was last week sorry the US Department of Agriculture animal and plant health inspection service reported that cows in Texas Kansas and Michigan have been affected with the bird flu there are indications that the virus is spreading to additional hurts in New Mexico and                      Idaho as well these findings Mark the first time the HP aai has been detected in da cattle and the second time that the virus has been detected in a ruminant ruminant I don't know what that means r m i n a n t on March 20th the Minnesota Board of animal health announced that the virus had been detected in samples from juvenile goats on a Minnesota farm where poultry had recently contracted the virus and this is according to the American Veterans Medical Association these fucking nerds in their acronym anyway the avma                      president Reena Carlson said API has been detected in goats and now in dairy cattle underscoring the importance of adherence of biocurity measures this is where guys this is where the argument for the WF becomes really it means more because they're going to look at this and go you see cows are getting sick and people are getting sick from the cows so we have to euthanize the cows and humans to make sure that they don't spread this is where it comes from ruminants are animals that chew that chew                      chud okay all right 104 but um that's the direction they're headed in they're they're going out of their way guys to make sure that we don't eat chicken meat we don't eat meat so chickens are coming down with the worst case of Aven flu that they've they've ever seen and then you have cattle now being affected by this now I didn't read any articles on whether or not they you euthanizing cattle I don't know but I find it interesting guys that of course they announced it last year or two years ago that they want us to eat let meat                      now all of a sudden all the meat eating animals are getting sick whatever I think they think we're stupid I know most people are stupid but still H1 sorry h5n1 has now been reported in cows in several states in the United States I wouldn't be surprised if there was an infection in cows in Europe too maybe people should start looking yeah but if I'm not mistaken a lot of these cow did not display signs they just randomly tested them oh uh Adriana ignore Juan Santos he hasn't been on here in a while but he                      just breaks my balls for the general purpose of breaking my balls doesn't it's all right it's cool he gets to uh he gets to watch my channel and and you know give me a view so he's helping out unbeknownst to him according to the USDA cows infected by bird flu have recovered after isolation with little to no Associated mortality report while infected cattle result in lower milk production Federal agency have ensured the milk loss is too limited to have any major impact on the supply currently so                      again guys I'm not worried about this bullshit I'm really not this um this bird flu transferring to human and from cow sorry from bird to cow from bird to Goat fuck them whatever they're always going to try to keep us nervous and on our feet it don't matter man we can't Panic we really can't there's no such thing as panicking in this stage of the game we are all far too invested in our preps and in our skills guys to turn around and start panicking over this bullshit so yeah we if it gets tinkered                      with if the bird flu gets manipulated if it gets manipulated guys then I can see it becoming super contagious I mean like worse than Mr 19 I could see him being that bad if they mess with it which I I definitely do see them messing with it uh but am I worried about this no we should not be worried about this bullshit this is just another stressor that they're putting on us so that we ultimately guys snap crack or fucking just get sick and die I noticed guys that the wef is going into hard drive                      the world economic forum is going into hard drive into keeping us sick and getting us sicker in fact there was a report overseas somewhere stating that sunbathing for an hour can increase your chance of cardiac issues you only post a sun bait for anywhere between 10 15 20 minutes half hour tops depending on the power of the Sun so of course guys if you sunbathe sunbathing or basking in the sunlight if you will is good for the body it's good for the brain is good for hormones it's good for mood balance especially mood                      balance it's also good at fighting off a lot of diseases now this article comes out after that they've done multiple studies saying that basking in the Sun for a few minutes a day helps fight a lot of viruses that are in the body it helps fight you getting sick of course the rebuttal article comes out if you lay up in the sun too long you could get sick I never heard of such a thing sorry I haven't slept I haven't slept in 21 hours so I am it's starting to hit me like a fucking ton of bricks right now so of                      course guys the wef is going into hard drive now the wef I'm going to mention them again on the angry truth Channel because we're going to talk about something that I personally think they're implementing it but they're disguising it and having doctors and psychiatrist give the green light for a trend that's starting to pick up and that Trend that's starting to pick up guys is going to get ugly within the next 2 three 5 years and in 5 years it's going to be it's going to be bad it's going to be super bad so yeah we                      shall wait and see where that goes and I do not like where that's going I don't um and it's going to be part of their plan the world economics forums master plan they're implementing this trend and I did not see that coming I tell you there was a lot of shit I see the wef doing I did not see them authorizing or the very least pushing this trend to be part of their depopulation I was like wait what yo they're smart they're smart fucking people that's all I can say so moving right along guys the whole migrant                      situation in New York City or cities like New York are going to get worse I keep saying this you're going to see videos of it you might even see a video of me walking down the street and dodging bullets like fucking Neo in The Matrix it's going to get fucking out of control um the the other scam if you're talking about the whole sunlight shit that's a scam telling us not to sunbasque or sunbathe that is bad for our health to sunbathe that's definitely a scam if that's what you're talking about listen guys a lot of this I think                      is just to Rattle the nervous system again I go to sleep soundly at night I hear this shit and I'm like man I can't wait for the apocalypse and I go to sleep and I wake up ready to rock and roll waiting for the apocalypse and it don't happen fine I bring my fucking my my my Competitive Edge down uh a few notches and then I I go on with my day but when it happens it's going to be fucking fast and it's going to be unsuspecting we are not going to a lot of people I I I tell you guys some of the YouTube                      channels I'm seeing out there where they're telling you the exact dat of some shit's going to go down I want to kick these people in the fucking teeth because there the audacity to them to sound like they're fucking Gypsy and they're like oh on this day this is going to happen and if this happens it's going to be on and then you're going to die and if you don't have food you that's it you you you and your family are going to look like little Ethiopians but white you know like crazy shit like that but people guys are are going                      to they're going to see that's all I can say it's it's going to get it's going to get rough in the next couple of years and people are going to are are definitely going to fall into a lot of traps because they're going to be setting up traps along the way the bridge collapse and everybody was like it was just an accident my ass and then a week and a half later another one gets hit wasn't an accident guys we can't be that naive like don't get me wrong I was still riding the middle I wasn't like I                      was 100% sure but I wasn't looking at it at any given time like I mean I looked at it as an accident it could be an accident but I'm like in back of my head I'm like you know damn well that's not an accident that is not an accident but whatever all right guys if you don't mind do do me a favor or a solid thumbs up please or thumbs down let's see if we can get the thumbs up to a th000 at the very least thumbs up helps with the algorithm because YouTube's algorithm changes every day I can't figure this                      shit out I can't but anyway back to the YouTubers and their um kicking them in the teeth a lot of them are just built to scare you guys that's all it is you got to listen you got to realize that some of their information might be good it might be good might something for you to put in the back of your head but they are doing it guys so again to make money you maximize your money by scaring the shit out of people in this field you maximize your money by showing people how to use gear now I'm going to jump                      into some more Gear review hopefully that goes some right I mean hopefully people watch it if they don't they don't but a lot of people a lot of channels they get the thumbs up in the thing man in the the thank you in the the thumbs up at the bottom of the screen people are putting thumbs up in those in the than God am I tired or am I just seeing shit but anyway yeah listen man I don't I don't think anything's going to happen but it's definitely worth talking about I forgot somebody just fucking said that                      some guy with a marine uh path they think that there's going to be an attack and they're going to wait till the peak of the the the the blockage and attack there is that guys there is always that but I'm not worried about it like not at all it is what it is right and and and listen you you people got to make money right somebody and their excuse is well if if if if if I don't do it somebody's going to do it all right man see how you sleep together at night listen somebody was asking me about a certain prepper making one of                      these Preppers event I'm going to ask such and such prepper if he can come out to to this event I'm like he is not going to show up a lot of these Preppers guys on YouTube will not show up to a lot of these events they are all about the money and themselves they will not show up right somebody was asking me if if you know do you think the Canadian prepper will come to my event no that selfish fuck wouldn't come Full Spectrum Survival I don't think he would come I mean maybe it was local to him he                      might but I don't see these dudes turning out to these events and if they turn out to this event they're going to have fucking a booth and they're going to be like look at me I'll sign your fucking forehead with my fucking pen you know like that kind of shit these people and a lot of them are fooling themselves a lot of these people do not have the capacity to come out and meet their subscribers they just don't and I think some of these people think they're that famous I know where I lie in the famous                      scale and that is fucking really low because I don't look at myself that way and I don't go anywhere going hm I wonder people to notice me I don't give a fuck I do not care right and so meeting you guys is what I care about I like meeting a lot of you guys I met people at the Kentucky sustainable living it was cool it's cool meeting his subscribers but other than that that's it I'm not going to sit there and act like I'm an important negro this important nigga is walking through the block and I'm F no I'm not                      doing that shit and a lot of these guys don't do that because they got a million one excuses oh I'm busy oh I'm I'm stocking up my my warehouse because the apocalypse is coming these people are not about you guys they don't fucking care they are not going to turn out not at all right and now maybe if I call them out maybe they will right I mean maybe Canadian prepper does shit out there out in in did I say the Connecticut prepper the Canadian prepper maybe he'll go out in Canada and and turn out to one of those things maybe                      you know maybe he won't full spectrum I don't see him turning out to any of these things you know and there's a couple other guys that will like Hudson Valley prepping in survival he'll turn out uh I think pinball might turn out to certain events that are within his range you know because he's old and he's got to go to sleep now but um he'll definitely turn out this shit you know because he's about the fucking people you know there's a lot of channels out here that that are about the people they're going                      to turn out because they want to meet their their their peoples and they also want to network networking is important networking is the most important thing guys that we are going to do as a community moving forward that is the only thing I think that matters more right now is networking seeing who you

A9	https://youtu.be/5qkrR9yTsbs?si=nL9YBwIQdLfBhwDr	  I'm Desiree and this is Body Fusion. Do you want to meet my friends? Donna. Michelle. Donna. Let's begin. This is a low impact level one workout. But just because it's low impact doesn't mean you won't get high results.   Our first exercise is called the step. Step left, step right. Left, right. Left, right. If this is not challenging enough, watch Michelle show you the advanced style. Left, right.   right, left, or take it easy and do it easier like Donna M. Left, right, left, right, left, right. This aligns our chakras and helps oxygenate the blood.   Let's tone our arms. You can use weights or any household item. For a more advanced workout, use one pound hand weights. Or air. Flexibility is important.   Breathe, and one, two, three. Do the best you can. Someone has done this before. Take it to the limit. If this is too difficult, work your fingers.   That's all for today. Put in tape two for an even lower level body workout. Body fusion.  
G20	https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=HCP1UW7_86M	- My patients ask me some pretty interesting questions, hard questions, but you really challenge me in the comments and sometimes ask really weird ones as well. So I'm about to answer some of your comments. Huge thanks to Grammarly for sponsoring this episode. Let's get started. Peewoop! Beep Beep I'm A Sheep. I like that name. Beep Beep I'm A Sheep. (sheep bleats) "I want a dog so badly but I'm allergic. Is there anything I can do to get rid of that or any other allergy?" There are some treatments that exist  where you can actually slowly work your way out of an allergy, and there are shots, there are tablets, sublingual tablets that you can do. I'm not an expert in it, but I know it does exist. It's like a form of immunotherapy. I-Drew, YouTube. "Where does a memory go when it's forgotten?" (effect blips) Left pinky toe. And if you wanna get it back, you have to only think about the left pinky. (buzzer buzzes) I'm not sure. Where does the memory go? It just, the connections (connections buzzing) aren't there to remember it.  But I will say the best way to remember something that you've forgotten is to not think about it. (laughs) Because forcing yourself to think about it is sometimes is the worst thing you can do. That's why taking time off sometimes yields the best boost to productivity and creativity. And by the way, this is the one thing that, in terms of like harmful effects of TikTok that people talk about, before we used to have a lot of free time, so we're waiting for the bus, we'd sit with our thoughts and we'd be introspective.  We'd think about stuff, we'd remember memories. But now we're never alone. (ominous music) We're always looking at something. We're always being controlled by whatever it is we're watching. So we don't have that free time anymore. And I worry about that. (ominous music) (static buzzing) "If someone has a fever that we're trying to cool down and you only have one ice pack, where is the best place to put it?" I probably wouldn't want to cool someone's fever with an ice pack. I can't even imagine.  Okay, I'm gonna remove the term fever. If I'm just trying to cool someone down (thermometer whistles) because they're having acute hyperthermia or something, I would put it under the armpit. The most surface area that you're gonna get contact with the skin and it's the most surface area with an important blood vessel, the brachial artery. (heart thumping) It's right there. So you're getting a lot of blood circulation moving past that area. I guess you could also do it in your groin as well. But like same principle.  "Why do we have boogers?" Boogers are mucus. (mucus squelches) Mucus traps unwanted substances. It acts as a barrier. It's really good. We like mucus, (tense music) unless we have too much and then it becomes a problem. (bell dings) So that's when we try and clean it out by using nasal saline sprays. "Why don't little kids get sore from physical activities? Even teenagers get more sore than little kids." (heavenly music) The beauty of being young. Everything is so ready to heal, so much circulation.  Also, it's smaller, so less distance for nutrients and blood flow to travel. But the regenerative capacity of not just a young child but like a baby is incredible. When babies are sick, (baby crying) the time for them to recover (bell chimes) sometimes is like this. (fingers snap) Meaning like on day four, sometimes they'll look very sick, and then day five, they'll look like nothing ever happened to them. It's incredible. "If a woman gets into an accident or falls really hard, could her eggs break,  like if you drop the chicken's egg on the floor?" No, these are not the same types of eggs. Humans have different eggs. (bell dings) They're called eggs 'cause they're part of the reproduction cycle. Very different eggs. No shell on the human egg. "I don't have a 4.0 grade point average. Can I still be a doctor?" Yes, in fact, getting perfect grades doesn't correlate with a better physician. I will say there are doctors who just get by and finish last in their class, (record scratches) and those doctors are also called doctors.  "I have a sore inside my mouth and it's taking forever to heal. I can't exactly put a Band-Aid on the inside of my cheek, so would you recommend anything to help it heal faster?" Look, in general to help sores heal faster, you want to prevent the irritation. And irritation can be both chemical and physical. It could be other things, but those are the two main ones that I see happen in my practice. Physical meaning, you know, you're chewing on your cheek or you keep biting the same spot of your cheek  or your braces are rubbing on your cheek. Chemical could be like you ate something very spicy or you burned your mouth. That's like more of a thermal one than chemical. But let's say it was a burn and then you were eating spicy foods and citrusy foods, that can create longer lasting inflammation, irritation. But then (tense music) if you have a wound or a sore that's not healing on the face or mouth, it absolutely needs to be examined because there are cancers of the mouth. There are cancers of the face  that happen when you have a non-healing wound. In fact, on the sun-exposed areas of the face, if you have a non-healing wound, it's almost to the level of skin cancer until proven otherwise. And mucus membranes, by the way, are some of the fastest healing parts of our bodies. There's so much circulation there that it actually heals up quite fast. "What's actually happening when your foot falls asleep?" Either you have suppressed the nerve's ability to fire so it feels really numb, you cut off circulation to the limb  by putting pressure on a blood vessel. 'Cause remember, if you put enough pressure on a blood vessel, you can choke it so that the part further away from where you're choking stops getting circulation. And if it stops getting circulation for a long period of time, those muscles are like, "Yeah, we ain't working." Those nerves are like, "We ain't working. We're taking a break until you fill us up." And that's when you feel the pins and needles and all that good stuff. That mechanism is actually a good mechanism  'cause it's in place to warn you that hey, you're choking off your foot. You should change position and get up off the toilet. 'Cause not only are you choking off the foot, you're probably raising your risk of getting a hemorrhoid, which is why I tell people not to TikTok on the toilet. Back to the questions in just a second. But first I want to talk to you about Grammarly, the AI writing partner that helps professionals write better and faster. Sometimes I make YouTube videos like these where I see your questions for the very first time  and answer right off the cuff just like I do with my patients. Other times though, I like to write out my videos, like in this animated project where I told stories of mysterious deaths that doctors still can't explain, spooky. Writing a video like that not only took a lot of research, but a ton of creative effort to get the words on the page in a way you can truly enjoy and understand. Fortunately, my writing process has been made so much more efficient thanks to Grammarly, but it's not a tool to help me write more.  It helps me write faster and not just on big creative projects either. I can use Grammarly to help me craft emails between my hospital or messages to my animating team. Its AI features help my writing feel more compelling either by improving my word choice or actually trimming out the fluff, which I have a bad habit of doing too often, like right now. I also really appreciate that Grammarly does not share any of my data with other AI language training models. Meaning I can trust that all my writing and info is private.  I'm always in control of my own data. Not only do 96% of users say Grammarly helps craft more impactful writing, but also, you could sign up right now and download for free using my link in the description so you too can get started with Grammarly to make your writing better faster. "Is it a big deal if I pee in the shower? It all goes to the same place down the drain anyway, doesn't it?" There are some positives and pros to peeing in the shower. It saves time, it saves water. But health risks, there are some unique situations here.  Urine is not fully free of bacteria. A lot of people think it's fully sterile. (buzzer beeps) It's not really sterile. Remember, it also has to travel through your urinary tract, which it could pick up some pathogens across the way. When it exits your body, (liquid swooshing) it could pick up some pathogens. So there are some potential sources of bacteria. That being said, there's bacteria all around us, inside of us. That's not the end of the world. But if you have a urinary tract infection, and you pee,  and you step in it, and you have a cut, could you get an infection? Yes. Pretty low risk. There are also instances of issues of almost conditioning yourself to pee every time you hear running water, like when you're in the shower. (valve squeaks) So the next time you hear that, (water swooshes) you're gonna wanna pee and it's gonna be uncomfortable. There's also instances of like people saying, "Oh, I should just pee just in case," especially in females where they say, "I want to pee just in case before I leave."  And "Maybe we should pee in between classes so that I never have to go to the bathroom." If you do that too often, you can get into the situation where you train your bladder to send signals for you to wanna pee very early. You could also cause some pelvic floor dysfunction. If you're doing it every now and then and you don't make it a a routine thing, I think the risk is pretty low. Pee away. (buzzer beeps) I don't know. It's a weird question. "Doctor Mike, do you agree with me that your celebrity doppelganger is Zachary Levi?"  I don't know who that is. - Levi. - Levi, who's that? - An actor. - Do you think that is? I always thought it was Keanu Reeves. (effect chiming) "Matrix." "Would it be healthier to go barefoot all the time like cavemen?" No. (laughs) When you go barefoot all the time, you open up yourself to cuts, scrapes, infections, bone bruises, like there's all sorts of issues that happen from that. So, no. (whip cracks) Protect your foots. "Do I need to wash my armpits if I always wear deodorant?" Absolutely! You wanna wash off the deodorant.  And deodorant is just scent and a little bit of alcohol to kill some of that bacteria, so it doesn't actually solve the problem. And it could build up in your armpits and then cause blockages, and irritations, and ingrown hairs, and all these problems. So please wash your armpits. In fact, the most important places to wash, (effect popping) groin and armpits and the genitals. I guess that is involved in the groin. "If you feel a cold coming on, is there actually anything you can proactively do to shorten how long you'll be sick?  There are so many cold pills and supplements and hacks and I wonder if anything makes a difference." The hard answer on this is outside of the basics, I'm talking about staying well-hydrated, adequate rest, eating your fruits and vegetables and proteins, lean proteins, there is no (tense music) magic supplement thing in the pharmacy that's going to do this for you. I say this as someone who lives that by example. When I'm sick, I desperately want to get better, but I don't go to the pharmacy and pick up (buzzer beeps)  giant mega doses of vitamin C. I don't go pick up (buzzer beeps) the zinc tablet that promise miracle cures. Like it just, it's not gonna help. If you're not getting adequate rest, maybe you want take an over-the-counter medication to lower your fever or your aches and pains 'cause that will allow you to rest. Maybe you want to take a medication over the counter that can make you sleepy so that you get adequate rest. Maybe, maybe, maybe in some cases that works. But in general, I try to follow the mantra  of less intervention unless it's absolutely proven to help or I'm willing to trade off the negatives. Or if I'm just giving myself something to ease my physical discomfort, (video window pops) there, I kind of open it up to grandma's cures, chicken noodle soup, a little cloth pad on the scalp, a little back rub, whatever. Whatever you wanna do, you want to drink ginger tea, (crickets chirping) (mouth slurps) if it's not causing you harm and the risk of it not working is still zero, by all means go.  "Why is my girlfriend always cold? It seems like girls are always colder than boys." Mm, hard to make that distinction. Having lower muscle mass, lower body mass in general can make you more cold. Having anemia can predispose you to being cold, thyroid dysfunction, so there are certain things, but hard to make that generalization stick. "What would happen if you never got rid of a splinter? Would it live in your body forever?" You can become best friends. No. It can, like your body can create a little capsule around it, almost like an abscess.  'Cause the body does a good job at walling off from foreign substances. Ideally, you don't want that to happen. 'cause that could become problematic. So you wanna get rid of them. See a medical professional. I don't advise people doing it themselves, unless it's like fully out there and easy to reach. Even then if it starts getting red and spreading, the redness starts spreading, you could be at risk for cellulitis. Kayla, YouTube. "Have you ever wanted to quit YouTube?" (tense music) There have been times  where I came close to quitting YouTube. One of those times happened to be when the company that helped me start my YouTube channel, they kind of gave me my initial funding and some resources to start the channel, actually saw us after one year, and I thought we were doing pretty decently, we picked up 300,000 subscribers, they said, "No. (tense music) Dr. Mike, we view you as a failure. You turned down some of the sponsorships that we wanted you to take." Some BS vitamin stuff and some clothing brands that I didn't really like.  I didn't wanna lie to my audience. They were so mad at me that they fired us and they labeled us a failure. And in those moments, you kind of look at it and you say, "Look, I'm a doctor. I really wanna focus on medicine. Is this the right path?" And ultimately, I wanted to help as many people as possible using the knowledge that I've picked up over the course of my career. And I thought, if I could do this on a scale such as big as YouTube, I would be a better doctor. I thought I'm a family medicine doctor.  When our patients were in emergency rooms, we went there. When our patients were in the offices, we went there. They couldn't leave their homes, we'd do a home visit. Now (hand thuds) my patients, not literally my patients, lawyers don't come after me, are on social media. So it's time that we (hands clap) as family medicine doctors take the call to action. (triumphant music) And I came back and we proved them wrong, and went viral time and time again, and now have almost 12 million subscribers thanks to you.  (knuckles cracking) Is cracking knuckles problematic? Click here to get that answer, more responding to comments. And as always, stay happy and healthy. (upbeat music) 
AB20	https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=_4fuvBKZUs4	I couldn't tell if you hated me or you liked me when we first met. - Oh, in the beginning, I didn't like you at all. Everybody, I don't like. It's like: Let me see what you're made of first before I make my decision. (laughs) That's how I look at it. 'Cause we're there to protect the patient from you guys. (Mike laughing) - Virginia *Carltonbeck is a nurse with nearly 50 years of medical experience both in-hospital and outpatient. Over the last year, she began to have debilitating back pain that limited her ability to deliver the stellar care
 
 she was known for the last half-century. You may have seen Ginny in my "Day In The Life" videos, given that she also happens to be the nurse that I've worked with for the last decade. So when I found out that she was in pain, not being helped by doctors and was ready to go for surgery, I knew I had to step in and figure out what was going on. This intimate conversation will cover the decade-long journey while we worked together, the nursing profession, and her horrendous experience dealing with doctors who apparently forgot their oath
 
 to help their patients. I hope you're not only able to learn what to do if you're ever in the same situation, but also learn what an amazing human being and nurse Ginny truly is. Without further ado, let's get started with "The Checkup" podcast. (transition whooshing) Ginny- - Yes. - 10 years has culminated into this moment. - It's been 10 years? - Isn't that crazy? - Are you sure about that? - I met you... I remember exactly when I met you. - Aye, yai, yai. - June, 2014. - Oh, wow, yes. - And it's about to be January 2024.
 
 - Wow! - So it's about our 10-year anniversary. (Ginny laughing) Isn't that incredible? - (laughs) How time flies. - Do you remember the first time you met me? - No. - [Mikhail] No, it wasn't memorable? - Well, no, I remember I heard about you coming in, this Dr. Varshavski. He's been with the Philippine Miss Universe. And you've been on the red carpet. And you were in Atlantic City. - Wait, hold on. Did that happen then yet? No, you're already in the future. - Oh, okay, well, that's... Okay, so that happened-
 
 - It was even before. - Before, yeah. And then I... Really, Diana is the one that told me. The administrative assistant told me about, "Hey, have you talked to Mike?" And I go, no, 'cause you were mostly with the third-year, Grace, in the beginning. And I go: I don't care; see what Grace thinks. And Grace was so shy. She was, like, worried about being with you. And she's lovely and she's a brainiac. And she came up and she was worried how it was gonna be with Mr. Popularity at that time. - Yeah, that's right because Grace, Dr. Grace Charles,
 
 was my senior at the time. - Yes, yes, I remember. - And she heard that I might be on my phone way too much. And she was worried about working with me, so she sought out your advice. (Ginny laughing) What did you tell her? - I told her: Don't let him get away with anything. What else could I say? You gotta be a doctor. You gotta learn here. But you did, and she reported back to me how you were also. - And what, did she say anything good, bad? - Yeah, she said, "Gin, he knows his stuff." I go: Really?
 
 Okay, we'll see how that goes as time goes on. - You know, the only argument I ever had in the office with a staff member was with you? - Now, isn't that funny? - The only- - I had to challenge you. - Of course, but then you sort of became my work mom. - Yeah, yeah. - Yeah, I remember the argument. Because I asked to order an EKG, 'cause my patient's potassium levels were high. And you were like, "Why are you getting an EKG? "We're busy." And I'm like: But we need the EKG. And you were like, "You don't know anything.
 
 "You're a resident." - I said that? - Yeah, you were feisty. - Oh, but what did he come in for? Not for that. - It wasn't for that. That's why- - Exactly. - You were like, "He doesn't have chest pain." And I'm like: But I'm not getting a heart attack EKG. I'm getting something else. You were really mad at me. - I challenged you 'cause it was like you're in for something else and now you want EKG. What is the reason? (chuckles) - And I remember, you know who calmed me down during that moment? - No, you were really mad at me?
 
 - [Mikhail] No, I was just, like we were getting into a screaming match. - No, I don't remember that at all, Mikhail. - Yeah, you were like, "I'm not getting it." I'm like: Well, I'm telling you to get it. - Well, I'm glad you didn't tell this in front of Joe. - Joe is the one who calmed me down. Joe Tribuna, Dr. Joe Tribuna is our residency director. He heard our argument. He walks over and he goes, "Mikhail, shh. "It's okay, it's just Ginny." - It's okay. (laughing) - I'm like: But I need the EKG.
 
 He goes, "It's okay, it's just Ginny." - That's fair. But you got your darn EKG. - I got the EKG and the EKG was normal. So everything worked out. Hey, Bear. - So duh, I was right. - Look at Bear coming to say hi to you. - Yeah; hi, Bear. - I can't believe this is your first time meeting Bear. - Well, I wasn't around when you brought him in. I wanted to meet him from the very beginning when he was a pup. - I brought him in on a Saturday. - On a Saturday, yeah, I wasn't working. I always wanted to meet Bear.
 
 - You always had the comfy schedule. - Oh; yeah, right. - How long have you been working at the hospital? - I've been with Overlook Hospital for 38 years, I think. - 38 years? - Yes. - Ginny, that's longer than I've been alive. - I know. - That's longer than both... No, it's not longer than both... - It's a very long time; it's a lifetime. Plus before that, I worked somewhere else. I was in Rhode Island, Colorado, so. - So how many years have you been a nurse practicing? - Like 46, 47 years. - 47 years. - Yes.
 
 - So you have wisdom to share. - Wisdom? - Yeah. - Yeah, right. - What's your biggest takeaway from being a nurse for almost half a century? - I'm tired. Destroyed my back and I'm tired. I love my patients. I gave them all I got, every one of 'em. On the floors, I worked so many years on the floors. And then I came to family practice in 1989. - When I was born. - Oh, isn't that interesting? (laughs) - Yeah, what made you wanna switch off the floors to primary care, to a clinic setting? - I was getting very tired.
 
 It was very tiring; it was hard. I'd been doing it for like about, well maybe 10 years before I got there. Maybe not even, around there. And then a friend of mine worked there and she goes, "Oh Jen, you'll love family practice. "You'll love the residents." I didn't even know about family practice at the hospital. But I did run into Dr. Susie Kaye, one of our docs, and Dr. Tersh Murdock. And I go: Oh, they're family practice. So I go: Let's see how that goes. So I've been there ever since. - What made you stay there for so long?
 
 Like most people move on. You even in the past had multiple places that you worked. - I know, I found that was kind of weird too. But I think I just loved the residents coming and going. You get to meet people. Every new year, you got a new crop of residents. I just loved the attendings that I worked with. And it was a really family, home-oriented practice, I believe. And it kept me there. I fell in love, got married, had a baby, got divorced. Many of those doctors went to my wedding, many of the attendings.
 
 It was just family-oriented. And we would have Christmas parties every year at somebody's house and it was always fun, and parties throughout the year of celebrations. And Dr. Joe Tribuna is the head macho and so is Susie Kaye. And you can't get anybody better than those two. - Yeah. When I came there, I did my first look, which is when you're still a student and you spend a day with the residents and the attendings. I was like: Wow, this place on paper sounds like a family. But then in person, they also act like they're a family.
 
 It was such a supportive environment that I've never seen. And I bounced around from hospital to hospital during my rotations. But Overlook was really an example of what it's like to lead with a family value in a field where family values weren't valuable. (Ginny laughs) - I get it 'cause we took care... I've taken care of babies that are now, I'm taking care of their kids. So it's a family-oriented practice. I do miss my patients. And I just get the biggest kick out of my original patient's kids coming in.
 
 - Yeah, that's incredible. Do you have a patient that sticks out in your mind through your years of practice? - Oh, not just one; quite a few, quite a few. - Who? Like, you don't have to say their names, but... - Well, one girl was there when I first started. And she had a couple of babies. And the girls have grown up and they have babies. And one of the daughters always said to me, "I only want Ginny to give the shots to my babies "'cause she gave me my shots." And she just thought, I don't know what,
 
 but I just adored... You know, I would go and even though I wasn't running that doctor who had her kids, they would come and get me to give the shots. And the mom, the first mom, at that point is the grandmom, but she always, you know, wanted to see me and do stuff. And a lot of people, they just want me to give them their shots or they have to see me and we have to like, especially long-term patients. You know, I welcome them and I hug 'em and we talk about each other and what's going on and how you're feeling and,
 
 you know, just stuff like that. - It's sad that after 30 some odd years that now you're coming to the point of retirement. - Yeah, it's a wonderful thing. - Yeah. - It's wonderful. - Is it just because you wanna chill? What's driving the retirement? 'Cause you're the glue that holds the office together. - Oh, Mikhail, that's so nice. - No, I'm saying it genuinely. When I walk in and I walk through the hallways, the first person I wanna say hi to is you. - I know; you always did do that. You always said hi to me.
 
 He had to say hi to me. He had to pass me at some... We have an office on Main Street and here goes Mikhail comes strutting down the hallway, you know, and he always says something. - And it was always the most warm welcome. Like no matter what bad mood I was in, if I saw you and Cherry and everybody there, it was just happiness right away. - Aw. - Even if something bad was going on, like in life or something else. That's rare. - Yeah, yeah. - That you wanna come to work to see your colleagues.
 
 Most people are like: Ah, I don't wanna go to work. - Oh, I always loved that job. That was my blood, sweat and tears. I mean, I would always go beyond and above. That was just me also. And I never wanted to like make the patient wait for any extra length or anything. I wanted them to be happy. And I made them... I think in my own way, I made them feel comfortable and fun. We had fun. - But you didn't just do that for patients. You did that to residents. You did that to the CMAs who worked with you.
 
 - Oh, I loved my CMAs; I loved them. - You did it to residents that needed help, whether it was mental or even you financially helped out some residents. Like that's unheard of. - Uh-huh, yeah; really? - Yeah. How many nurses do you think are going around helping residents? - I don't know. - It's rare, Ginny. I'm telling you 'cause I work in the hospitals. It just doesn't happen. That relationship doesn't happen. What drove you to be a nurse in the first place? - Oh, Mikhail, now we're going back.
 
 I don't know, I think I always... I was in high school and I was volunteering as a, what do you call volunteer, a Candy Striper. - Candy Striper? - Yeah. Back in the day, the people who volunteered, especially young girls, were called Candy Stripers. And in high school... - What does that mean? - What did it mean, I don't know. I don't know who invented that. - It sounds weird. - But I was like volunteer. It was a Candy Striper. You had this uniform. I would go after work to this one hospital, not in Union but in Elizabeth, the town of Elizabeth.
 
 It was Elizabeth General. And we would go take the bus there. And then that was my kind of first exposure. And I believe my mother dressed me up as Clara Barton once upon a time. And she just thought I was gonna be a nurse. - Who's Clara Barton? - Clara Barton was one of the nurses who started... - Ginny, we're 50 years younger than you. - Oh my gosh, you never had this in school? - No. - She was a nurse. She started becoming a nurse. I don't know what year. I would've did my research if I was gonna mention her.
 
 But yeah, she had the blue cape on, I believe, and always helped like during the wars back in the day. And I think my mother dressed me up like that for Halloween to be a nurse. And I think I liked that, liked that cape on me for some reason. - So you liked the outfit? - Yeah, kinda. And then as I grew up, I don't know, I really couldn't tell you why. Just, my mother wanted me to be a nurse and a nurse and a nurse. - Was she a nurse? - Nope. - So what was she? - She was like an administrative assistant,
 
 secretary type of person. And she actually worked at Elizabeth Hospital also in the emergency room like registering people. She did that a long time. But I don't know why she, I don't know. All I know is that I just loved the nursing school. I loved the anatomy. And when you walk into the room and you see the patient and you make 'em smile and make 'em feel better, I think I liked that reward. I mean, I know I did my job. You do whatever that had to be done. I worked on peds. I worked on pediatric kids with cancer, a few years of that.
 
 That was heart wrenching. - Is that harder than regular pediatrics? - Well, it was a mix. They were on the floors on peds. Yeah, you feel for the babies and the parents. I mean, peds really got to you after a while. 'Cause I did go to a few baby funerals when that happened. You know, stuff happens. And then those were a great group of women too that I worked with. Everything for the patient. That was the route to go. - Who stood out to you? Well, who stands out to you right now in your mind of either other nurses or doctors that you work with
 
 as exemplary medical professionals? - Do you want me to mention names? - Well just, sure. You could give by first name. - Well, Dr. Alfred Murdock. He was one of the finest gentlemen I've ever met, and is a wonderful doctor and caring and hands-on doc. And he didn't like the computer world either, same as me. I didn't like the computer world. He would get so frustrated with it. And, of course, Joe Tribuna and Dr. Tom Holland, all these attendings that I worked with. - What made them special? - They cared.
 
 Dr. Murdock was caring for anybody, and he would go the extra mile for anybody. If something was bugging him, he would figure it out and get whatever it took to get this patient well and go somewhere. Just, he was just a giving doctor. And I believe he was born to be a doctor. His father was a doctor at Overlook back in the day. - And then what happened to him? - He passed away about 2012. - While he was still working in our residency? - Yes. - How did that happen? - He got sick over the weekend.
 
 It was a weekend. He was vomiting and vomiting. And he said to his wife, "Something else is going on. "I feel weak on the one side." And they called the squad. And he was having a stroke And they helped him, and they did all the stuff that needed to be done. And then they transferred him to a rehab. And here's my Dr. Murdock with a hospital gown on. And I couldn't stand it 'cause he was always very dressed to the nines. He liked his suits; he liked all that. And we would always like bust his chops about that.
 
 But here he is with a robe. And I always said: They can't do better than this gown for you, for my Dr. Murdock? And then eventually, he did pass, which broke everybody's heart. The whole hospital was just sad, just very sad. Even attendings came up to me with tears in their eyes when they heard about Dr. Murdock passing. Yeah, it was very emotional then. Our whole office was so, the whole feeling of it was just so sad and the grief. Yeah, that was a big part. I was his nurse, I was part of his nurse.
 
 I just adored him for, you know, as long as I'd known him. - I actually started my residency just after that. What year was that that that happened? - '12. - '12, yeah, I came in at '14. - [Ginny] That's right. - So I came in kind of on the heels of that. And everybody would talk about him so fondly, and his memory. - Oh yeah. - There's plaques and memories of him. And I never got a chance to meet him. - You would've loved him. He would've got a big kick outta you. He would've really gotten a big kick outta you.
 
 - Why do you say that? - Because you're Mikhail. You're different, you're in the limelight, you know. He would've bust your chops, I think. He would've got a kick outta you. - Do you think that he had an influence of Dr. Tribuna and that's how? - Well, they were around the same... See, family practice doctors, I think they're very unique. They need to know the patient totally. And they get to know the patient. And Joe was always like that also. I mean, Tersh was before him. I mean, Dr. Murdock was before him.
 
 But Joe did meet him, Tribuna. And then Joe got to be a doctor in our Chatham office. And then the associate director and then now the director. Yeah, they're very similar, the same molds, you know. - I remember rounding with Dr. Tribuna the first few times. And we would go see patients in their rooms and I'm busy thinking about their blood tests or the specialists they need to see. And he's more focused on, "Let me open your yogurt and feed you." - That sounds like Joe. Because yes, Joe would go, and so would Tersh.
 
 They would work on that stuff and worry about the other stuff later. Just make 'em feel comfortable, the patient, you know. - Yeah, that was their primary goal. It seemed doctors would be trying to get out earlier out of the office or outta the hospital. And they would try and stay later. Not because they wanted to stay later, but until everything was taken care of. - Yeah, yeah, they would be there late all the time. I don't think, I don't even know when Tersh would leave sometimes 'cause he was always doing something.
 
 And I know his wife was waiting for him at home for dinner, but he'd get home seven, eight, you know. - Pretty typical of the office. - Yeah, we're family practice. You know, they call it Overlook Family Medicine now, but it is family. - Yeah. - And they put out good doctors that still care. - Yeah, that's rare in society these days. I remember when we first started. I was like, I couldn't tell if you hated me or you liked me. - Oh, in the beginning, I didn't like you at all. Everybody, I don't like.
 
 It's like: Let me see what you're made of first before I make my decision. Of course, I was nice and polite. But no, let's see, you know, how this goes. That's how I look at it 'cause we're there to protect the patient from you guys. (Mike laughs) - You know what's funny? That's so true. - It is so true. - Yeah. Like nurses prevent doctors from being bad. - Well you have to be with them and cover them. And one thing with Dr. Murdock and the other, some of them want the nurse in there. And now, it's grown up now that the nurse and the MA
 
 can't be in there because they've gotta do other 50,000 stuff while they're, you know, and you don't get to be with the patient. Most of the time, I've been in the rooms with the doctors, you know, getting stuff, doing stuff with the doctors, with the patient, and in the room. Now, like they don't want us in the room. They want us in and out. - Yeah. Well, that's how the same, they want us in the room on the computer writing the note. And I'm like, no. I would get in trouble for that all the time.
 
 I mean, you knew that. - Yeah, well that's... - How often did that? Would you say that's the biggest complaint against me? - Well yes, Mikhail was behind days of seeing, typing up some notes for patients. 'Cause they can't get charged. And then you got the billing people on Mikhail's case. I mean, emailing him, sending all sorts of nice and nasty notes I guess. (laughs) That's all we heard about. - I learned medicine from Dr Tribuna, from the likes of a Tersh Murdock, of you wanna be there for the patient,
 
 not for the computer, not for the record, not for the billing. So if I could choose between writing the note on time or giving better care, it felt like there was no option. Of course, you give better care. - Hands on. - But I feel like that has changed. - Oh, absolutely. The epidemic took over, the computer world took over. It's changed the whole dynamics of being with a doctor. - Do you think that's for the good or for the bad of healthcare? - Well, I guess there's some good points about it. But being an old nurse, I like patient care and hands-on.
 
 The computer can wait with me. I would go in a room, write everything on paper, deal with the patient, then I would come out and put it in the computer. But then the doctors would get mad at me 'cause I would take too long on the computer. But I couldn't do it in the room. Because I didn't know what I was doing. I was computer illiterate, and I had to learn all by myself how to do it. Plus the help from my friends. - Sure. - But it got to be pretty funny. - Watching you suffer with the computer?
 
 - Yes, that would be more stressful. I could save your life, but don't put me on a computer. - Do you think doctors are better connected with their patients now or they were 30 years ago? - Oh, well, I... - Answer it genuinely. This isn't a politically correct answer. - Well, I don't think so then. I think hands-on was the best way to know a patient and talk to them face to face. 'Cause some people would always come out of a room and say, "They don't even look up at me" and da da da. And I think that's disrespect for the patient.
 
 I mean, I'm not saying all the doctors do that. But that's the way the business, it's a business now. It's not like it was. And how Overlook used to be was a very family-oriented hospital. And you knew everybody in the hospital. It wasn't a big conglomerate like it is now. But merging of all these other hospitals. But that seems to be the way of the world. And it's in the business world. - Is that partially what's driving your retirement? - Well, not really as much as my back. (Mike laughs) The pain in my back where I couldn't walk anymore,
 
 that kind of did it. And, of course I said before, I think I'd miss my patients. I do miss that contact and I do miss my friends at work. You know, we were all family and buddies and... - I think in 10 years, I've never seen a place change so fast. - Because like, I started and it was such a family. Finished residency, became an attending there. And now I don't think besides some attendings, it's this, none of the same people from when I started which is incredible. - It is; everybody's changing... - Whereas in your era, it was 30, 40 years of service.
 
 Now it's, you know, a year or two and you move up or move on. - Yeah, I moved on. It's just, it is different. And you're right, you saw a lot of changes going on. - It's also during that time where the computer's coming in, the conglomerate world, the business world is all starting to take over. There's different responsibilities. That's why everyone's stepping down. Dr. Kaye's changing her position. I wouldn't be surprised if Dr. Tribuna comes out and says, "Hey..." - He can't yet; he's too young.
 
 - Well, he's young. But I wouldn't see too far in the future of him saying, "Eh, I'm gonna start winding down." - (laughs) I don't know. He's got grandkids now, so. - Exactly, he's a granddad. - He wants to have fun and he wants to still be a doctor. - Do you have any memories of us working together that stand out in your mind? - You and me? - Mm-hmm. - You know, putting patients in with you. I don't know, we always had fun. I mean, you know... - Isn't that weird to say? We're in a place where people are sick, and we had fun?
 
 - We did always have fun. - Isn't that weird? Like it's weird, right? We had a good time. - Yeah, we did have a good time. I mean, Mike, you would get mad a little bit, but nothing bad. I mean, we were probably running behind or something and then "This patient isn't in the room." But that goes with everybody. You know, we can only do... I keep telling him, I multitask too much and you can only do one thing at a time. I mean, you multitask. That was my job, multitasking. You know, putting the patients in when necessary.
 
 You know, playing at the desk, being triaged, doing refills, answering phone calls from everybody. And also the information desk for everybody who would walk by. I was like the Main Street. - You were. - We had the Main Street. - You were the hub. - The hub, yeah, yeah. - Did you find it shocking that Atlantic hired me after residency? - Yeah, kind of. - Why? - Because you're a, you know, you're a famous man. And I guess they like that part maybe. But I was surprised. But it was good. It's a good thing 'cause you had a nice array of patients
 
 that liked you for OMT and you would help them. And more people, I recommended you to. They absolutely like adored what you did to them and helped them. And one thing you did help is a lot of younger people. Like they could talk to you, the younger generation in their 20a and they had problems. I know these kids have more problems today than ever I feel. And you did help them 'cause they felt comfortable relating to you and talking to you about their problems and how you would help them. You've helped quite a few patients of mine
 
 that needed help from a doctor like you, a young man that knows, intelligent you could say, and they could relate to you. - It was weird because when I did social media initially and I became an attending, it felt like more people online had no idea that I was practicing as a doctor. Like that world never was shown. So they always thought I just did videos online and I wasn't practicing. But we would be working together so often that I think your view of me is drastically different than everyone else's view.
 
 - Oh, absolutely. - [Mikhail] How do you think it's different? - 'Cause I know the real you. I don't know this other one, YouTube, oh, oh, oh, you know, Mikhail, Mikhail. I didn't care about Mikhail being a YouTube guy. I cared about Mikhail at the desk working with me and dealing with patients. And that's the way I knew Mikhail. - Yeah, I think the fact that, you probably don't even remember this, but when I came in to the residency in 2014, I didn't have a big social media following. I was just a resident.
 
 So I worked with you for a year in my intern year before the popularity started. I think had the popularity started before that and I came in already YouTube popular, I think you would've judged me differently. - Well, I wasn't into YouTube. I'm not into all that social stuff. - Well yeah, but you would judge it. - Well, I would definitely not let it weigh my opinion of you as far as a doctor. 'Cause you have to be a doctor and I have to see how you are with patients and all that stuff. And obviously, you passed my test. (laughs)
 
 - Well, I passed your test and we got along great. What about everyone's opinion of my work that worked with you? The Cherrys, Yvettes, Colettes? Did they have the same feelings as you did? - Yeah, yeah, I think they all felt that, yes, you know your stuff. Of course, they had not doubts but wanted to see for sure how you acted. - So they were skeptical. - Yeah, yeah, that's the word, yeah. - And then how did it land for them you think? Like when you guys would talk about it? - Oh, I think it landed well.
 
 We all agreed. I mean, of course, I was backing you 100% because I'd seen you in action I don't know how many times. And people have commented. You know, we talk to the patients when they come out of the room. I never heard anything negative like right now. But it was always good. And people like respect you and, you know, you go in there, you're friendly, you talk to them and you make 'em feel comfortable. - Yeah, it's important. - Yes, you take the ease off of 'em. - Well, what I started doing in Overlook
 
 that I never really did in my training or thought about in my training, partially led by Stuart Green in our office, is really focusing on the mental health aspect of physical problems. And I felt like patients really either respected that or some were very anti that. Someone even filed a complaint at one time where I did a YouTube video on it where they were like, "Why is he talking to me "about my mental health when I'm saying my back hurts." But I think it's important. - I believe it's important also.
 
 'Cause a lot of the physical has a lot to do with the mental status. - Yeah, for sure. And that kind of drives me to the point of my graduation. You remember you gave my speech? - I did give his speech. That's right; you got an award. - 'Cause each resident would get someone to present either their graduation speech or an award to them. And do you remember what you did? - Yeah, I vaguely remember. (laughs) - I'm curious what your memory serves you. Let's see. - I forgot what award you were up for.
 
 - It was like some excellence award, Medical Excellence Award. - Of course, he was excellent; I forgot. - Of course. (laughs) - So it was the year that "La La Land" came out, the movie. And it was a joke as we were announcing the award. And we said "La La Land." And like some people got it and some people didn't. And then it actually wasn't... I put you in saying something. Oh God, I forget the wording I used. But it was my tall white... Oh, right now, I need a tall White Russian. (Mike laughs)
 
 And Mikhail totally missed it. And he didn't get up right away. And I'm looking at Mikhail in the distance. - I thought you were talking about alcohol. - Well I think you were a nice tall White Russian. - That's fair; that's fair. - Yeah, and I think it was a joke. 'Cause I do like White Russians as an alcoholic drink. Aye, yai, yai, it was funny. That part was funny. - Yeah, that was a good graduation. - Yeah, it was fun. - I remember you always telling me stories of what it was like to be a nurse back in the day
 
 and how different it is, that you would flirt with some of the doctors. Is any of the "Grey's Anatomy" stuff true? Because like now, I look at a "Grey's Anatomy" episode, and I'm like, this is so not true. There's no flirting going on here. No one's hooking up. But you're saying, back in the day, it happened all the time. - Well, yeah, there was lots of stories going around that hospital when it was a small hospital. - Yeah. I mean, tell us some of the stories. - Oh, I don't know everybody's story.
 
 - Well, you don't have to say everybody's stories. - You know, there were times, you know, at night hours, evening to the night and things were happening that you didn't know about. - You had a boiler room. I remember your boiler room stories, Ginny. - Oh, no, no. (Mike laughs) - But it was different than it is now. - Yes it is very different. - I felt like people had connections back then. - Yes, we knew like a lot of people. Overlook was small. I'm not saying it was a small hospital. It was a tight-knit people working three to 11.
 
 I floated in the beginning. I knew all the people on the floors, it was fun. You knew like, you know, the dietary people. And you knew the environmental people, the engineering department, all that stuff. But now, you know, it's different. And everybody's busy and running here and there. - Yeah; well, that creates a not-so-romantic environment these days. - Yeah, but a lot of people have latched up with other people from the hospital. - What? - A lot of people. - No, they haven't. - Yeah, they have.
 
 - Not in the last 10 years. - Oh, I don't know about that. People get involved with the person at work and... - Really? I didn't see it. - Yeah, yeah, behind closed doors. - Well maybe, but not like how it used to be with your boiler rooms and you sneaking off with residents or whatever you were doing. - Oh my goodness, Mikhail. - You know, when you were a young lady. - Bringing up some dirt. - Some good memories. But the real reason, well not the real reason we have so much history and obviously,
 
 the YouTube channel is aware of you probably from my first "Day in the Life" video. Because part of my YouTube channel, people were like, "Do you even work as a doctor?" I'm like: I should do a day in the life video. - That's right, you did say that. - And I actually got in trouble for doing "A Day in the Life" video. Because it was like: You didn't clear it with the hospital. And you didn't do any... - That's right, I remember that. - And you were in the opening of that video. - You're kidding. - Yeah.
 
 And you said you got some messages for being in that video. - Oh. - Did your friends message you? I remember you were saying something about that. - Is that the one that I was yelling at you and you were telling me... - No, you were like, "Sit here." And I sat on a garbage can and you were like, "You know, there's a lot of good looking men "walking around in scrubs." And that, what else did you say? You had really sad stories from patients who were, you know, at the end of their lives and they shared some words of wisdom with you.
 
 - Oh, yes, Mikhail, that was a long time ago. - Do you remember that video? - No, but that was a long time ago. I remember the video where you were trying to film me and I'm working at lunch. And I had no idea he was filming me. And I'm yelling at him 'cause he was doing everything like a little boy would do. I'm yelling at him: Mikhail, go away; go away. And he filmed it without my knowledge. - Yeah, they posted it. - Until the next day. (Mikhail laughs) - And then you were like, "My friends are messaging me
 
 "saying that I'm on some social media platform." (Ginny laughs) - And there goes Michael walking by me at first thing in the morning. He goes, "Gin, we have 10,000, 10,000." And I go: What? What's 10,000? He goes, "10,000 hits, Gin." I go: What? And then he came around to the side of where I was sitting and he showed me all this stuff, and I was mortified. And then people from I haven't talked to in a while kept saying, "Oh my gosh, Gin, is that you?" Texting me all this stuff. - Yeah, that was pretty funny.
 
 - You have a lot of fans on the channel. - That's pretty funny. - It's true. - That's very funny. - And then recently, you took a medical leave of absence because you said your back was hurting you a lot. Without divulging too much of what's going on now, what led to the medical leave of absence? What were your symptoms then? Just strictly speaking in the past? - Well, I had extra weight on me, and my back was really hurting. I did have it addressed before, months before. And I was living on Tylenol or ibuprofen.
 
 And I thought it was, you know, nothing major. But by January, it really bothered me a whole lot. And getting up, running around the floors, walking, you know, it was hurting. Walking out to the car at the end of the day, 'cause you never left on time, it was just like really aggravating. I did go to a doctor then, had x-rays done. And then by May, I just said, I can't do this anymore. It was too much pain. I had epidurals that did not work. I went to several doctors. They said I wasn't a candidate for surgery
 
 'cause my MRI and the CAT scan wasn't as bad as what it could be I guess. But I was still in pain. It was low back pain, and- - You also had ablations, right? - Yes, I had ablations after the epidurals didn't work. I had more needles in my back than a siphon. I don't know. It was just one thing after another and nothing really took care of the pain. - And you were out from the office for a long time at that point? I remember it was September and you were still out. - Yes, nothing was better; nothing was improving.
 
 - Literally nothing was improving. And you were losing weight at the time, but still the pain wasn't improving. - Yeah, that's another farce thing like with the back pain. 'Cause I lost weight and it didn't help the back pain a bit. So I don't know, people out there. - Yeah, it wouldn't solve it. - It didn't improve the pain, I must say. - You mentioned you saw multiple doctors for the back pain. - Yes. - And almost none of them examined you. But were some of those visits bad? - Well, being a nurse and expecting more,
 
 I got less from a very competent doctor who I chose to go to. And he was very matter of fact. You know, as he's looking at my X-ray and everything, he's talking to the X-ray, not actually to me. I was sitting like on the opposite side of him, but he wasn't very kind in saying... And as he got up, he just said, "You know, you're not a candidate for surgery." And I was like: Ah, ah, ah, like what? Where I thought I would be a candidate for surgery 'cause of the pain, but when he was reading the MRI, the CAT scan,
 
 it wasn't as bad as what I felt. But I also was dealing with pain. So to me right then and there, surgery would've been my answer and I'd be pain free. But just how he just dismissed it was the problem. - How did he dismiss it? What was his actions in the room? - Just walked out of the room. Just said, "You're not a candidate for surgery." Got up and left. Never answered my question, never said anything. - Never cared about your pain, nothing. - Never said, right, correct. - Never examined you. - Right.
 
 And he said, "You gotta go see someone else," at that point, which I had to get up to go to the counter where the nurse was. And she would describe what I was gonna do next. So I was like, what? At that point, I just said like: Oh my gosh, I came here. - Were you disappointed that after all these years of service to the healthcare field, the healthcare field treated you like that? - Well, I was disappointed that he wasn't gonna help me. And I wouldn't say the whole healthcare. Because at that time,
 
 I thought they were doing the right thing. It made sense. - Imagine you as a nurse, you're getting that level of care. What would they do to a person who's not medically trained? - I don't know. I mean, I asked questions and it just wasn't getting answered. And especially at that one doctor, he wasn't very intimidating. But he wasn't giving me any answers. - But it's not even that he didn't have answers to give you. He just wasn't interested in having the conversation, it seems. - Right, I think he felt it was a waste of time
 
 for me to come to see him. And I know he was a busy man. - That's rude to make you feel that way. - I know, but that's kind of how I felt. And then walking out of the... You know, of course, nothing's close where you park. I mean, and everything. I was like in tears by the time I got to the car. 'Cause it was hurting me, I got no results. And he wants me to go to somewhere else. My thing was I wanted an immediate answer. Let's book the surgery, I'm ready. (Mikhail laughs) - And then we went to a dinner,
 
 because I hadn't seen you for a long time, with Dr. Tribuna and his wife. - Right. - And you told me how much pain you were in, and that you could barely get around. - Yeah. - You were saying like, "I couldn't walk." - I couldn't walk long. - And then you showed me your MRI. I looked at your MRI. I wasn't too impressed or excited. - Right, which made me mad 'cause something has to happen here. Why am I in this pain and nothing, and you were not impressed. He goes, he wasn't impressed. I had a CAT scan done; I had an MRI done,
 
 x-rays done. - Yeah, I looked at it all. - The hips done. - Nothing exciting. - Nothing exciting but I'm in pain and I couldn't walk and I wasn't going back to work. - And I remember in early October, you had scheduled an appointment for spinal surgery of a spinal cord stimulator to be put in. And that's when I got really mad. - Yes, you did; yeah, you did. - I was like: Ginny, you have to see me before you go for that. - Yeah, yeah. - And you were reluctant. Why were you reluctant to see me? Like you said, all these patients say great things.
 
 You trust me with that stuff. But then you were reluctant to see me. Why? - Well, let's see. Because you are Mikhail and I am an old lady. And there was like no way I was gonna have Michael Varshavski like look at me, touch me as a doctor. - Why not? You trained me. - I know. But it was just something with me I guess. I was, you know, what could I say? But then I consented to it 'cause I had Dr. Joe Tribuna on one side talking to me and Mikhail on the other side. And I think maybe I had one drink in me or something.
 
 And I just said: Okay, let's make an appointment to see Dr. Varshavski. - So against your will, you were forced to see me. - I was forced to see you. - I had to make your appointment for you because you refused to make it. - Yes. - But we made it. And you officially became my patient. Which meant that we had to sign a bunch of paperwork for you to even have this conversation with me. - Yes. - Which is funny. And then you came in, and you tell me how the visit went. - Well, it was pretty funny because Mikhail was,
 
 well Dr. Varshavski was saying that he thinks it's my hip. And I'm saying, I don't have pain in my hip. It's my low back pain, which Mikhail knew all along, but he kept insisting it was my hip. And I kept insisting it's not. And he finally yelled at me and said, "Ginny, stop being a doctor to yourself. "I'm the doctor here." And he meant it. (laughs) And I said, okay. - What I remember from the visit is I was examining you. And I was checking your back and I didn't see much wrong with it. And you didn't have much pain or tenderness in the area.
 
 And then I would examine your hip and you'd be screaming. - I was in pain. - You were screaming. - I was saying: Mikhail, stop it. - And then I would press, and you would scream. And I would say: But, Ginny, I'm pressing on your hip. - And it's like, I don't know. I was baffled because I still didn't get it. - Yeah, you were arguing almost with me. - Yes. - You were in disbelief. - Yes, I was arguing with you. - Because you just thought it was your back, and you've been told it's your back so many times.
 
 - Well, let's see. Everybody did everything for my back and then nothing worked. And then I thought it was still my back 'cause that's where the pain was. But my hip, and Mikhail was the only one that actually touched and physically touched my back and my hips. I went to many doctors and they only looked at the X-rays and the MRIs. And they all said I was not a candidate for surgery, but I still had back pain. So I went to very nice doctors and they didn't do much for me. - Ginny, are you saying you went to see
 
 pain medicine doctors? - Yes. - Spinal surgeons? - Yep, two. - Orthopedic doctors? - Yep. - Your family medicine doctor? - Chiropractors? - Chiropractor, yes. - And none of them examined you like the YouTube doctor did? - No, none of them examined them. Nobody touched my back except Mikhail. - Ginny, that's terrible. - I agree. How do you think I felt when I had to actually go to you and confess that okay, you're right? - I mean 40 years of service to the healthcare field. People are examining you,
 
 trying to give you good healthcare. But no one's performing a physical exam. This blew my mind. I got so mad. - I know. - I was furious. - Mikhail couldn't believe it. I couldn't believe it either when he asked me, did anybody touch it. And I said, no, nobody touched my hip. - And you were scheduled for a spinal cord stimulator with no one examining you. - I know, they all took like for granted from the X-rays, the MRI. - Yeah, they said: Let's look at the imaging. Like your hip is fine on the X-ray.
 
 But like touch the hip, perform, like move the hip. No one did it. - Uh-uh. - What's wrong with our current healthcare system if that's happening? - It's the computer. - The computer is evil. - I think so. Back in the day, it depends on how you were taught being in the residency and who your... And now, the surgeons, the surgeons I went to, they all showed me the MRI. I've seen more pictures of my back and the MRI and the X-rays than I care to. And they couldn't see anything really wrong. And then that one doctor suggested
 
 I have this stimulator put in. - And without examining your back? - Without touching anything. - (laughs) So we do the exam. I realize it's your hip. At that point, you're probably in debilitating pain probably for six months. That's fair to say? - May, June, July, August, September. Yeah, yeah, about six months, yeah, yeah. - Because I remember October 10th was the date of your potential spinal cord stimulator surgery. So it was a week before that I saw you. - Yes, you told me right away, "Do not do it."
 
 - Yeah, I said cancel that appointment, please. - Cancel that, which I did. - And you were initially confused, rightfully so. You're like, "What do you mean, cancel it?" (laughs) You're like, "I worked to get this appointment." - Right, I wanna be pain free. - Yeah, so we canceled it. We got you to see someone else to do an injection into your hip. We got you with a physical therapist. - Right, we had the platelets. - Wait, we first did the steroid? Or did you go for the PRP? - No steroid, no steroids.
 
 - You did the platelet-rich prolotherapy. - Yes, the platelet-rich- - Plasma prolotherapy. - Yes. - So that's where they take your blood, they spin out the platelets which have healing factors in them. They inject it into the joint. - Yes, a big needle. - A big needle- - On both sides. - And the goal of it is actually to cause inflammation and potentially heal the area. - Right, so all the good stuff in there will come to that area and start healing it. Which I didn't feel much pain, which I didn't feel at all healed.
 
 - Well yeah, it's not a miracle thing. And in fact, it doesn't work the majority of the time. - Oh, that's great. - But if it works 40% of the time, that's still worth avoiding surgery. - Yes. - So like it depends. And you have to be realistic about expectations on those things. But when you saw the doctor that I recommended you see for the injections, the doctor agreed that it was a SI joint, the hip joint problem, in that area. - Right, it turned out to be. And the physical therapist too what I went to.
 
 - And the physical therapist got you a supportive belt, started with the exercise, some alternative things with dry needling. - Right. - Recommendations. And now it's December. So you were in pain for six months, couldn't walk, about to get surgery. It's six weeks later now. Where are you at now? - I'm very good. The pain has ceased. I think, you know, I could actually do housework without stopping in pain. I could sleep. I never had a problem sleeping. That was the other weird thing, I never had a problem sleeping.
 
 There was no pain when I slept. Just when I moved, I got lots of pain, and walking and stuff. I could walk long now. I could actually do more things. - Isn't that incredible? - Yeah, it is incredible. Totally, I would never have been off of work all this long if I knew what I know now, obviously. - If you just came to me. - Yes. And Mikhail, he did tell me throughout the time to see him. "Why don't you come and see me?" And I said: No, Mikhail, until they surrounded me that one day at dinner and they made me do it.
 
 They were bugging me and I said: Okay, I'll consent to go see Mikhail. - I always was really happy with our relationship and grateful for our relationship. And I always wanna help patients, no matter who they are. They could hate me, they could love me and I still would wanna help them. But to be able to help someone who trained me, who was my work mom for 10 years, I mean, do you know how amazing that feels to be able to help you to walk? Like you couldn't walk from your car to the office. And now, you're fully functional.
 
 - That's amazing. - And I didn't do anything magical. - Yes, you touched my hip and it hurt. That was something. 'Cause I wasn't complaining of pain then. It's just when he was touching and physically examining my right hip is when the pain was there. - And it's gone. - And it's bizarre. All I could say, it's been very bizarre. - It's incredible. It's sad that it just takes a physical exam that was missing to be able to help you, and no one did that. Does that make you mad? - Yes, I wasted my time, a lot of my time
 
 going to all these high-end docs. And even the pain management never physically touched me. She examined me. I walked, I did all that. She saw what was going on. But yes, I think it's kind of sad. It's sad that, you know, it took Mikhail, my Mikhail, to figure out that something's going on with the hip. And all along, I must say he kept saying that, "I think it's your hip, Gin; I think it's your hip." I go: No, I don't have pain. So my thing was the pain in my back, which obviously came from the right hip with the ligaments.
 
 So I guess I wore that ligament out for many months. - Yeah. And the dangers of you going for those procedures: epidurals, ablations. You might have even had surgery had we not seen you. Those are risks. - Yeah, but luckily nothing happened. - Thank God. - Thank God nothing did happen. I mean, I needed some relief at that point. And it's helped, temporary, nothing final. - What would you recommend to patients in the future from your learned experiences? - Well, don't be afraid to tell the doctor

M29	https://youtu.be/B3NhIoVqE40?si=agvL2p4Ww8gEux94	 I've changed like I don't drink alcohol anymore I'm not sober I don't work a program that's what else I do is you know my own business right I do I was like this is a toxic behavior for me and my whole life it held me back because I knew that I couldn't like surrender to something nor give it up it was like that definition of insanity you do the same [ __ ] over and over again expecting a different result I was a complete prisoner of my own behavior and finally three and a half years ago I was like I can't do this  anymore it doesn't work for me I'm never gonna be that cool girl with the glass of wine at the party like I'll want three bottles like that's just my personality it's my addiction and when I finally let go of that it made me realize that I was capable of great change that I totally rebelled about I was like I will Master this toxic behavior of mine as if I could I just did not think I could ever stop I that was a hamster wheel I'd be on my whole life was that something that you had that aha moment yourself did you feel I  always knew it your life life push you towards that because yeah all my friends were mirrors they were like this is not working they said it for decades I said I knew it for decades and I just thought I don't know why I just I know I'm going to master this one day and finally I just gave it up so that has led me to believe people can change because I wouldn't change for decades like four decades I went you know drinking or less I don't know three and a half I'm terrible with math um so many years that like the narrative  was for me is this has a hold over you you will never break this cycle you are a prisoner of your own weakness and every time that you [ __ ] up in life it has to do with this you don't like yourself and you're probably going to be stuck in that for the rest of your life because you won't give it up because you keep telling yourself one day you'll Master this and the last three and a half years have been so awesome and so great and it's I don't have any Hang-Ups with it again I don't work a program I poor people drink  I have alcohol in my house like it's just to finally became a confident decision so I think once a cheater not always a cheater I think can you ask yourself though if I think if you're with somebody that cheats if they can change is second can you ever get over it right even if that person changed well the past just haunt you and torture you and be in the room with you for life then don't be in that relationship because you'll just keep punishing that person and yourself regardless of their change so if you  really can't ever get over it it doesn't matter if that person is going to change or not because you will bring it into the future um so but I do believe people can one day say I've been stuck in a shitty cycle that I'm totally aware of and for whatever reason I convinced myself it would fix itself one day and you have to do that hard crazy work of just switching it and sometimes maybe you're just so sick of yourself that you finally like let go or it's a really challenging thing and you struggle and  sweat and scream through the whole thing whatever it is I know people are capable of change right and I've definitely seen people who don't seem to want to make that change as much as they talk about it and it's always action over words in fact the less you talk about it and just do it the better my best friend Nan always had this saying that I love so much insecurity is loud confidence is quiet it so just do it and shut up about it yeah we've had somebody a good way to we were told that just recently say that  on our podcast that is that's very funny he's from Southern Charm Bravo TV shows the same thing yeah um but no you're talking about Evolution and change and Rio's talking about Tick Tock you're on Tick Tock I feel like we see great videos we love Tick Tock one of us are so into it because it's like goofy Central yes and it depends on what side you're on it is so if it's on your for you page like you can go down a hole where like views get bad like my Tick Tock changes all the time my algorithm where I'll get fed  like really just haunting tick tocks where I'm like you know what this is messing with my head and then the next day it's all food recipes yeah like having a great time cleaning and then decorations all the time I don't want Abandoned Dogs no sometimes I get like human trafficking yeah that's but I a lot of what I do get is creators and they do like a day in the life and they're in New York City and they live these awesome lives but I wanted to ask you if you had Tick Tock throughout your life what would a day in the life uh 15 at 25  and at 35. okay that's fun um I'd be curious to ask you the same question back um 15. oh um like really asking myself did I want to keep trying to be in films because I was totally blacklisted I'd gotten out of an institution did not was not welcomed like not because anybody was mean or cruel but it was just a it was a fun ride you're done um and I had to ask myself like did I really want to fight and prove uh to myself that I wanted to be here and the answer was a really genuine yes like it was my love it was my passion  it's what my family has done since the silent films and theater and into the talkies like I feel a genetic Cosmic pull and I love storytelling and I love I love it and I that was a really cool Revelation for me that I love what I do and I'm not doing it for anyone else or for the wrong reasons um that was 15. living it up uh now a producer making films um hanging out and doing like The Wedding Singer and Ever After and Charlie's Angels and just really wanting to like make the most of the opportunity and not  screw it up but just have the best time ever go to concerts kiss boys make out okay the best yeah dogs running around friends up all night work all day the best oh 25 was fun such good times and then what's the next 35 um very quiet and meditative thinking that I would change all of my behavior in order to become a parent and I met this man and like life got really quiet and serious um not lacking in fun or beauty but just like okay I think I'm ready to do my best to not screw this up and then you make plans and it all blows up in  your face um and then I just repeatedly kept it yeah 35 was very meditative and like okay it's funny when you put it in those years because if somebody says like do you have a five-year plan I would never have an answer like I don't know when people ask us all the time we say wherever the wind takes us I fall in love with what I'm doing or what's in front of me yeah or what is possible and I'm very focused on that I can diversify and focus on many things at the same time but I don't have board Vision or  I'm I also love that I also love that if you live it more like that when you look back at five years ago you'd be like wow my set my self five years ago would have never predicted where I am right now and that's cool like you don't you wouldn't say oh God I'm so off track of where I thought I was gonna be years ago I was so broken I was so sad about getting divorced and like raising my I just I was I was broken and I was unforgiving of myself and I never dreamed I could be at such a much more healthy forgiving  thriving place like our blended family is amazing the girls are happy I'm in a job I'm in love with my friends are good like everything's okay and five years ago I was convinced everything was broken for life  
J30	https://youtu.be/v7HjF8dfpIE?si=nPiU0RtlzWVKhkki	 I am a watchman who has been given eyes to see and ears to hear ears to hear ears to hear   They're silent weapons for quiet wars. You see, there's a shadowy cabal that conspires against you. Expose them. Conspires against you. And every time I hear their whispers. Open your eyes. Wake up. I blow the trumpet. Shall a trumpet be blown in the city and the people not be afraid? I blow the trumpet.   And that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition. Eyes to see, ears to hear. Shalom, family. Welcome to Shattered Paradise. Cuts from the archive.   Wow, the truth is really coming to the light in these last days. Well, at least for those of us who are able to connect the dots. In the past, we've seen the elites utilize sophisticated social and psychological warfare strategies against the masses. Psyops like the Hegelian dialectic, implementing order out of chaos. But today, it seems they believe the general public, the masses,   are so dumbed down, they no longer have to use complex and expensive social engineering techniques to manipulate the people when simple reverse psychology will do the trick. Rapper Snoop Dogg and Master P are taking on two giants in the retail world, Walmart and the Post Cereal Company. As NBC4's Gordon Tokumatsu reports, their lawsuit is all about shelf space and connecting fans to Snoop's new cereal brand.   Legendary rapper Snoop Dogg, whose real name is Calvin Brodus, via video this morning, part of a news conference with his business partner, rapper Master P, where the two of them announced they're suing serial giant Post and retail leader Walmart. This is about...   Minority-owned companies getting a fair share at issue is anecdotal video evidence from fans across the country They've been wondering says attorney Ben Crump why they can't find Snoop cereal on Walmart shelves dozens   of Walmarts all around America. Everybody went saying, where's Snoop's cereal? In the retail game, product placement is very important. Where is it in the store and who can see it? That shelf space in any supermarket first is worth millions and is very, very limited.   But in the video, Crump alleges that Snoop's, Fruity Hoops, Cinnamon Toasties, and others are being hidden from customers, sitting on stockroom shelves in the back of the stores, while Post brands and others remain on display out front. Today, Crump filed a lawsuit on behalf of the rappers. Among their claims against Walmart and Post, breach of contract, fraud, collusion, and conspiracy. We asked him, though, why Walmart would hide a product that could potentially make millions of dollars for the retail chain.   I just want to show you, this is Kellogg's Frosted Flakes and this is Kellogg's Zuccaritas. So in the version that's not aimed at the Hispanic population, you have milled corn sugar malt flavor contains 2% less of salt. And the ones that are being promoted to Hispanic population, you have milled corn sugar malt flavor contains 2% less of salt BHT.   right why are they doing that so this is up on the environmental working group website and it's talking specifically about bha and bht butylated hydroxy anisole and butylated hydroxy toluene but these are additives that have been shown to cause hormone disruption and harm the reproductive system and harm the reproductive system   and harm the reproductive system. And it says down here specifically about BHT that it may disrupt endocrine function by causing thyroid changes and affecting animal development, according to the European Food Safety Authority. And that studies on rats fed BHT found they developed liver and lung tumors.   So this is something that is not allowed in many countries in Europe, also Japan, banned from food. That is how dangerous other countries have acknowledged that this stuff is. They're still putting this in their products. They obviously they can make this, okay, without that. Clearly they can. So why are they putting BHT in the one and not the other? Ask yourself.   They want us to think that the man is trying to stop us from getting this cereal so we will fight harder to find it. Reverse psychology. Reverse psychology.   It is not a coincidence that Snoop Dogg's BHT-laced infertility loops are being pushed to the forefront at the exact same time Kellogg's Cereal for Dinner campaign is in full swing, which is messaging to low-income families that cereal is a cheap viable alternative to a complete nutrition-rich dinner.   The cereal category has always been quite affordable and it tends to be a great destination when consumers are under pressure. So some of the things that we're doing is first messaging. We've got to reach the consumer where they are. So we're advertising about cereal for dinner. If you think about the cost of cereal for a family versus what they might otherwise do, that's going to be much more affordable.   The cereal category is a place that a lot of folks might come to because the price of a bowl of cereal with milk and with fruit is less than a dollar. So you can imagine why a consumer under pressure might find that to be a good place to go. Right. I'm all for innovation and marketing, but the idea of having cereal for dinner, is there the potential for that to land the wrong way?   We don't think so. In fact, it's landing really well right now, Carl. Cereal for dinner is something that is probably more on trend now, and we would expect to continue as that consumer is under pressure. When I say cereal, you say dinner. Cereal! Dinner! Cereal! Dinner! Chicken! You can have the night off, chicken. Okay, I'll go marinate. Cereal! Dinner! Cereal! Dinner!   Though the eugenics population control arm of the New World Order is targeting the so-called blacks, Hispanics, and Native Americans, these groups are just being subjected to a double dose of what the whole working class population of America is being exposed to.   Might want to put that box of Cheerios back on the shelf if you're interested in your health. A staggering four out of five Americans are being exposed to a dangerous chemical linked to reduced fertility, altered fetal growth, and delayed puberty. Those chemicals are reportedly on a huge number of popular oat-based foods in America, including Cheerios and Quaker Oats.   In a study of the chemical chloroquat, a lot of these chemicals are obviously not good for our bodies. And I don't think it's any coincidence that we've seen a rise in chronic illnesses, in diabetes, obesity throughout our country as our food supply has gotten away from whole foods and more into these types of boxed prepackaged goods. Yeah, what happened to, I thought it was Quaker Oats. He's supposed to be a pacifist and his Cheerios are poisoning us.   And they're making us gay, puberty blockers, infertility. And they're making us gay, puberty blockers, infertility. The Long Beach rapper and his fellow musician turned businessman, Master P, are taking legal action against a major retailer they claim they've been discriminated against.   Please people, don't fall for this rudimentary reverse psychology attempt to paint these two played out puppets of the deep state as some kind of innocent victims of discrimination. This is an obvious attempt to target a specific demographic with a cocktail of gender-bending infertility chemicals disguised as a colorful and fun nutritious breakfast brought to you by two disadvantaged black entrepreneurs.   It's imperative you learn how to spot a Psy up. And this is a good place to start. I mean, it's hidden in plain sight. The ninth song of Snoop Dogg's debut album, Doggystyle, is even titled Serial Killer.   21 oat-based cereals and snack products popular with kids contain traces amount of this chemical, which is the active ingredient in the weed killer Roundup. For those of us who reside in the Western world, we are currently living through a catastrophically devastating manufactured gender war, which, at the highest, most metaphysical level, is being fueled by spiritual forces, ritual, sorcery, and witchcraft.   But at the physical level, it's driven by the hormonal biochemical transformation of our biology and environment, especially through the products many rely on for nutrition, our food. All right, Kellogg's is getting ready to celebrate Pride Month. A new heart-shaped cereal is coming out next month. And what is the end result of all this feminizing and emasculation on a society?   It'll be available for a limited time, and the cereal is berry-flavored, and the colorful pieces there, they're topped with glitter. For each box sold, Kellogg's says it's donated $3 to GLAAD, which helps with LGBTQ acceptance. And by the way, Pride Month is in June. And what is the end result? Despite all the challenges we face, I remain convinced that yes, the future is female.   Did you just put a cigarette into his mouth? That's... Oh, it's the video, if that's okay. I'm not judging. You're both consenting adults. Can I please capture your interactions? Thank you. Very kind of you. I wish everyone was as cool as this. So, ladies and gentlemen, we have two consenting adults role-playing in public. And I'd like to be offended, but they're two consenting adults, and I support their freedom.   But the viewers will be wondering, what is going on? What is going on? Female supremacy? Beta male? Are you a beta male? Okay, as the beta... Oh.   well i won't judge but does that not hurt the cigarette ash in your tongue is it okay if i speak to and can you answer questions what oh my phone's ringing um quickly what do you get out of it humiliation   Alright, so what's in a name? Hollywood's leading men have been called a lot of them. But now there is a new one that is making the rounds on social media. Baby girl. And experts say it is actually meant as a compliment. What does the term baby girl mean and why is it being applied to male actors or male presenting characters?   Good morning, Valerie and Joe. So baby girl, you know, I kind of think of it as a catch-all term, but it does have some specific attributes. It could be applied to someone who is vulnerable and also kind of has a submissive personality, or it could be applied to a man who is burly, surly, and the complete opposite of what we think of as baby girl.   This seems to be the year of baby girl. We've seen it really take off again around shows like The Last of Us, Succession, but we actually don't know who coined the phrase first. There's a lot of researchers who look for the origins of these certain words. We're just not sure where baby girl started, but we know that 2017 is sort of when we first started seeing it applied in this way. And some language scholars are actually applauding the term. Why is that?   Yeah, I spoke with a linguist who said, you know, typically female-sounding terms, when they're applied to, like, heteronormative men, we tend to think of that in our culture as a negative thing. Baby girl is thought of as a real positive thing, and it's sort of this feminine term that's applied to heteronormative men in a positive way. It's a way that our language is becoming more gender-inclusive and gender-fluid, and we're seeing that the way the Internet is expecting that in real time. It's really cool just to see how our language changes and evolves and sort of becomes...   more equal as time goes on. There's something in the water.   As you can see, the assault on masculinity is a spiritual obsession with the elites, but this demonic impulse does not stay in the elite circles, but is now disseminated in the most common public spaces in Western society.   This video was filmed at the Mall of America located in Minnesota. The obscene name of this drag performer which is boldly showcased on a massive jumbotron in a shopping center full of children illustrates their aggressive indoctrination campaign is accelerating.   Daddy, can you play Princess Princess with me? Sweetheart, I'd love to, but the guys, they're outside waiting for me. We've got to eat those. Steve, what is the hold up? Go, Neil! Go, Neil! Is that my wedding dress? It could be.   A six-foot-plus male basketball player at KIPP Academy in Massachusetts suited up for the school's women's team and injured multiple opposing players, which resulted in forfeiture at halftime. Now, you would think after being forced to halt play mid-game due to injuries sustained from competing against a male that the collegiate charter school of Lowell would go scorched earth in its response.   No, an opportunity to appear progressive simply could not be passed up. Stating, the charter school reiterates its values to inclusivity and safety. We also follow the state laws regarding equity for all student athletes.   Here, Kraft Mac and Cheese is openly illustrating the transformative effects of consuming their product, proudly showcasing that the food is not only unhealthy, but it's a gateway to the demonic. Predictive programming. Predictive programming.   X marks the spot. As the second great American eclipse quickly approaches, signifying biblical judgment, many Illuminists are either checking out or going into hiding. In light of the recent death of Lord Jacob Rothschild, 4th Baron Rothschild, there seems to be an acceleration in what Freemasonic thinkers refer to as the Great Work, the synthesis of dualistic opposites.   In recent years, some of the most powerful members of the Blue Blood aristocracy and the Illuminati ruling class have seemingly died of old age in so-called natural causes, leaving behind a tapestry of clues in the form of signs and symbols which adorn the architecture and walls of the globalist foundations and New World Order institutions they founded and left behind.   This year, at the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, while former UK Prime Minister Theresa May was addressing a room full of global elites, a few

AB33	https://youtu.be/ex0jEXAHFc4?si=xGIYR00HlkY1P2fF	welcome to yoga you won't need anything for today's video but here are some optional props that I recommend so pause the video here to grab your things otherwise if you're ready let's begin meet me in an extended child's pose so from a tabletop on your hands and knees separate your knees wide towards the edges of your mat and bring your big toes a touch behind you they don't need a touch but your shins should be like a V then sit your hips back towards your heels walk your hands forward and rest your forehead down onto  the mat to completely relax into place and your hips may not touch your heels that's okay and if this still feels too intense of a pose to start you can always stack your fists underneath your forehead for a little more support this is a resting pose so take a big breath in through your nose and out through your mouth relax again in through your nose and out through your mouth let go one more time in through your nose out through your mouth and be here now then seal your lips continue to breathe in and out  through your nose and rise up into a table top position on your hands and knees with your knees directly underneath your hips so your thighs are parallel with each other your hands directly underneath your shoulders so your arms are parallel with each other band your fingers out wide gripping into your hands so much that the pads of your fingers are turning white underneath each of your fingernails these are strong hands I call this Yogi hands and your hands and wrists will get stronger every time you  use Yogi hands on your mat now look at your elbows make sure you're not resting in locked elbows there's just a tiny little Bend just enough so that all the muscles around your elbows are engaged and they will strengthen and support your elbow joint over time then with these strong arms strong hands pull your navl in towards your spine this will help to lift your belly up and hold your core into place so you're not letting your belly droop down towards the mat your core is engaged then keep that engagement and extend  your right leg straight behind you driving back through your right heel so your leg is in line with your spine and hold keep your belly pulling in neck is in line with your spine Yogi hands are strong on your mat 3 2 one then lower your right knee back down into your tabletop and switch sides extend your left leg straight back behind you drive back through your heel left leg in line with your spine and all the rest of your tabletop is still strong and engaged with your belly pulling in and your breath  calm 3 2 one come back to tabletop well done from here walk your Yogi hands forward one hands distance then shift your hips forward into a modified High plank so your knees are still down on your mat but your plank that straight line is from your knees through your hips through your shoulders through the top of your head so you might need to lift the back of your head up to bring your neck in line now if this is the first time doing this video with me then I want you to take a seat and watch this  next part otherwise if you want to do it with me then from here I want you to keep the plank in your body as much as you can and just bend your elbows directly back as you lower down halfway until your elbows touch your ribs and then stop there and hold this is modified low Plank and then lower all the way down to your belly well done now press back into your hands to lift up into your tabletop and then take a seat on your heels or just stand on your knees and just shake your hands out that high to low plank just bending  your elbows back and lowering your plank halfway down is a common sequence of yoga poses that you'll see in a power yoga class so it's important that you learn how to do them properly and we're modifying so that we can build a foundation of strength so if you watched the first time through come and join me for the second time if you've done it the first time through come and join me for the second let's come forward into a high plank together modified With Our Knees Down find that flat back as if  there's a plank of wood touching the back of your knees your hips behind your shoulders and the back of your head maintain that plank and bend your elbows directly back as you lower your body halfway down towards the ground pause when your elbows touch your ribs ribs then lower all the way down to your belly that's a lot of work but you did it from here set up for a low Cobra keep your hands underneath your shoulders and zip your legs and feet together to touch behind you and press the tops of your  feet down into the mat so much that your knees lift up slightly keep pushing down through the tops of your feet and keep your legs engaged this way and then pinch your elbows together behind you as if you were trying to get them to touch and feel your shoulders open up now use your back strength to lift your chest and shoulders up off the mat and keep your gaze just a few inches out in front of your mat so you don't crane your neck the strength of your back is keeping you lifting in this pose even with your  hands down on your mat and feel yourself gently Bob as you breathe this is called Low Cobra number three you should feel the strength in your back two but not strain if you're feeling strain you need to lower down a little more one One release and lower your right ear down to your mat take your arms long down by your sides and let your feet fall open for a belly shavasana a pose of complete and total relaxation but if this feels like too big of a stretch on your neck right now then bend your left arm to place your  left fist underneath your left shoulder and that will help to reduce the intensity of the twist here completely relax if only for a moment and then draw your chin back to Center plant your hands underneath your shoulders and let's set up for a second low Cobra so zip your legs and feet together press the tops of your feet down keep your legs engaged this way and peel your chest up off the mat with your hands touching the mat but you're not pressing into your hands neck is in line with your spine so you're not  crunching your neck to look forward instead just look a few inches out in front of you feel yourself Bob with your breath three see if you can lift a little bit higher two One release and lower your left ear down to the mat for another belly shavasana arms long down by your sides feet fall open Total relaxation then draw your chin back to Center plant your hands underneath your shoulders press into your hands to lift up into a tabletop and then set up extended child's pose with your knees wide big  toes together behind you sit your hips back walk your hands forward rest your forehead down onto your mat or on stacked fists and feel your breath as it creates space in your lower back the secret to strength is the ability to hold yourself up when gravity is pulling you down and it doesn't matter if you modified or made it easier or you took a break you showed up and you held yourself up even as gravity pulled you down then slowly rise find any comfortable seated position that serves you so you can sit  up tall with your eyes CL closed and bring your hands together at Heart Center there is a place inside of you where the entire universe dwells this place is of Love Light truth and peace when you are in this place in you and I am in this place in me We Are One namaste well done hi I'm

M34	https://youtu.be/ZvFeJZCaALU?si=vRQQ9rgTNArBzImF	[Music] so [Music] welcome to the wide world of coupe at garage and reviews and today we're going to be reviewing the cheapest and most popular squat rack on amazon this is the 15 fitness reality 810 xlt power rack okay i've used it before but we're gonna bring it in we're gonna assemble it we're gonna build it then we're gonna test it by probably testing the weight capacity and some other crazy stuff so let's go get this is what it comes in pretty sweet actually you got to remember this is like 250 bucks on amazon including  shipping okay see come over here real quick i just want to show everybody you know sometimes people go coop you don't look like you lift things like that i just want to show you guys something sam can you tell me what that says right there it says mechanical lift mechanical lift i just lifted that by myself i'm not even a mechanic so just to tell you that's what we're gonna do so we're gonna unbox it build it and then review it let's do it let's get into this bad boy let me show you a pro tip really quick here  for all you first timers opening cardboard boxes if you don't have one of these obviously this is ideal however you can take this strip it is glued together and all you do is back pull it ah look at that isn't that nice it's like popping bands popping popping bands on benjamin's that's basically what i'm doing here but i'm doing on racks i don't pop bands on benjamin's i pop bands on rags let's go baby this is actually as you guys can see this is pretty darn good packaging they've got the corner strips which is  very smart to protect the package for a amazon package that this was free shipping the rack is so compact in this thing i bet i'm gonna open this thing it's just gonna be like crammed very smart packaging on it sam [Laughter] wow come in here every piece on this thing has corner braces with cardboard and has a you know saran wrap package that's pretty good the reason they do that protect the corners obviously protect bending and everything like that but also so you don't get a ton of marks on the  actual product wasn't expecting it it's pretty good [Music] done time [Music] sweet oh man that's best i've ever put a rag together okay this is the fitness gear fitness reality pro gear there's so many different names for this because there's so many different companies like selling this exact same made in china rack but the idea is this bad boy is 250 bucks now you can see in all its glory [Music] okay so i'm gonna go into a review give you an idea on it i've used this rack many times from other companies and with  friends that have it but i'm gonna go through through a review and then we're gonna do a weight capacity test because it says it can hold 800 pounds and we're just gonna see how much weight it can hold now i do wanna say something i wanna show you this because this is a very you know fun little thing all right hold on this is the cutest jacob i've ever seen in my life look how cute that thing is man and just to show you an example this is you this is the guy she told you not to worry about which is me so  look at that look at that oh my gosh it's just it's so cute you know you kind of want to kind of like it's like it almost comes from like a barbie doll house or something you just put it in oh i'm gonna lift my little weights but this is the reality this bad boy can hold a lot of weight and we're gonna find out exactly how much so this is the fitness reality 810 xlt i don't know why they call the xlt or xl or anything i think xlt actually stands for extra large tall which like i'm like six foot five and this is not  that much taller than me i'm actually five foot nine and this is not that much taller than me um however there is some benefits to this design one if you're a basement dweller and have short ceilings this is the perfect size rack two they maximized the amount of basically clearance that you could have for a really cheap rack basically what they were trying to do i know this because i've kind of been involved in some of this discussion is they try to box these racks as small and compact as possible  so that you can have as cheap as shipping as possible so that box that they sent it in is probably about to the maximum that you can get without having like an overcharge or something like that so because of that they're trying to like make this as short as possible however they did do something that was very smart and adding a multi-grip bar that comes up ahead so as you can see although i can't like really go fully extended like my feet are touching the ground if i just lift my legs a little bit which you know a very minor  inconvenience there's definitely worse things to complain about i can do a full stretch pull-up or the multi-grip bar same thing i just lift my legs just a little bit i can do a pull-up which is nice and that brings me into the other point and that is stability this rack is not the most stable right like it's using i don't i don't they don't list the gauges on this kind of rat on these racks i can just you know feel i've got i can feel the air right okay so yep 11 gauge yep not 11 gauge pretty scientific there that this is  probably like a 14 gauge rack i would guess somewhere around there however for most people an 11 gauge rack is absolutely overkill and the person that's gonna buy this is not the person who's lifting 800 pounds and even if you are i would guess that the possibility to do that is there the reason is because of how stable it is as you can see this bad boy is not you know here to like break any world records as far as like the stability that goes on here like just show you this example like the thing's not going anywhere right  this thing's flopping all over the place but for the person who isn't lifting a ton of weight this is going to make you feel comfortable enough and this is the other benefit that comes with this is it's got everything all in one and not only that very similar to some popular rep racks like the pr 5000 the pr 4000 that feature a lat pulldown down the middle this which this one came out before those so they may even got the idea from this has a lat pull down attachment option that goes on the back a plate loaded  option it's not like a super nice option but it's a great i think it's a great option for a compact form that's super cheap it just goes on the back so these stability bars here as you can see just add some rigidity to a less than stable rack it's not ideal to have these here because it doesn't allow you to like walk through the rack which is something that's kind of nice about certain racks if you like bolt them to a platform or something like that it's nice to walk through it however when you're getting  under here under a bar it's not really going to be that much in the way unless you're like super tall and even then like you know when you're squatting you can like dip under the bar to launch it out without feeling super uncomfortable but the other benefit to that to this is it is a power rack which means it can use safety spotters and the safety spotters they're using are a solid metal rod they're not like hollow so these are going to prevent you from dying basically these aren't like going to prevent your  barbell from scarring or anything like that but if you have this level of rack you know not to judge anybody but you probably don't have like a super expensive barbell that you're worried about the knurling you're more doing it for the function less than the form so because of that this isn't like a a device that's going to protect your bar or anything but it is going to protect your body from dying which is a nice thing so there you go it's secure which that you can then use for curls or you know you could use it for pin  pulls or you could easily use it as jacobs on the front of the rack if you'd like but then that allows you to bench and squat with protection inside now it is using one inch holes right here so the one inch holes on a this is a probably a 1.25 by 1.25 rack or something like that it's a very thin upright it's not like a 3x3 like we're used to seeing however it can still take some one inch accessories which is kind of a funny idea because you can use let's say a sorenex jacob that really these cost more than this entire rack  right here it's kind of funny actually now that i think about it contemplating my life choices however you can see it just like still fits these wouldn't be something i would you know buy specifically for that but something that you could use for it are attachments like these that really don't even work on 5 8 inch racks they you can't even find these for a five inch track leg rollers like this however you could use that on the 810 xlt that's pretty cool idea i like that but as you can see it's quite stable  it's got a multi-grip pull-up bar on top which is nice that allows you to do you know varied grips if you want to do chin-ups or wide pull-ups or even a close multi-grip it's a nice function that you know isn't something they'd have to add it's actually an add-on or an additional price for most racks that this comes standard the additional price for lat pulldown really like doubles the price of the rack but at 250 you're looking at maybe 450 or so with the lat pulldown pretty good deal and that includes  shipping it's got these plastic feet on the front and also a plastic on the bottom this mainly allows it to level out which is okay and other than that that's pretty much you're looking at it's a flat foot rack so since it's a flat foot rack you can put it just about anywhere whether you're in a home gym or a garage gym there's no places to bolt it down so obviously they're not recommending it being bolted down because you can't even do it however i don't think you necessarily need to and the reason is because the flat foot  rack in fact we did a review on the omni rack which is like a really expensive flat foot rack one of the reasons that it's kind of nice is because you don't have to bolt them down they're much more stable than just a rack that used posts because it goes out farther and then that beam is running all against the ground the entire way and that beam is the same gauge steel as the uprights which is nice now before i give you my recommendation on who i recommend this for let's kind of see what it looks like  with a boron and some weight [Music] we're at 315 pounds 315 pounds is like for squat kind of a initial gold standard for people squatting you know then it goes to 405 495 that sort of thing like builds up but i'd say 315 is quite a bit for a lot of people you know training at home not for me obviously but for people training at home just to show you out of the rack into the rack you thought i was going to squat that didn't you not right now i'm not warmed up okay so as you can see there's some wobble here but this is an  800-pound capacity rack and so if we just leave it at the 315 pounds we wouldn't be doing all of you just this so today we're going to keep adding let's do it we're getting some wobble i think the biggest worry would be it falling backwards that way but because it's got that flat foot right there i think we'll be fine okay that's 495 right there 495 pounds but wait there's more we must do more that's a that's a lot of weight you can see the barbell is bending this 190k tensile strength bar it is 28 millimeters so it's not like a  power bar 29 millimeters but these j cups b due to the extra beam underneath them they're looking okay i'm a little bit nervous walking under that thing actually but it's not it's not tipping or anything i think we do more i think we there's some room on the bar i think we do at least one more 100 pounder right on the edge too okay wow wowzer so what i'd say here's what we got 135 225 315 405 495 585 675. plus 200 is that 875. we exceeded the capacity look at that thing that is absolutely positively ridiculous  that my friends is a 250 rack from amazon shipped my door for free that is that's impressive would i lift that i wouldn't want to would i walk under it i'm not going to but i have enough confidence to put it on there and leave my beloved time fitness leg extension slash leg curl worst name in the world nothing creative about it but like station slash leg curl underneath it in its wake not only is it heavy there's 100 pounders on the edge too so it's like even more bendy let's just do a little shake test  all right and you thought we were going to stop there no we've got to do a drop just kidding if you'd actually like to see us do a drop we may do a drop but if you'd like i i don't know if you'd like to see one let me know in the comments and we may do one in the future if you want to do one let me know in the comments and there's enough of them i think we may do one wow [Applause] that's amazing okay we've just disassembled the 800 plus pound off the rack i think the biggest reason to show that is like  you don't need to be scared of these racks what i suggest squatting 900 pounds on a 250 xlt rack no which again i hate that name xlt nothing about this is xl or t however i think it's nice to actually do be realistic the reason it's nice to do is to give you confidence in buying something like this i wouldn't suggest lifting that much but what i can say is you can have some confidence despite it being a cheap rack that it's going to hold what you can you know use and that's kind of the thing it's like  11 gauge 3x3 do we need that big sturdy of a rack no you're not buying that nobody is really buying that for like function purposes it's nice for all the attachments everything like that but honestly like the weight that it can hold like nobody really needs that amount so what i will say 250 bucks shipped to your door for this rack for some people is nice if you're on a super budget this is a rack i can somewhat recommend i would recommend that more people save up and get a nicer rack and a nicer  barbell but there are people that are probably stronger than me out there that are lifting way more weight than me on this rack and doing so just fine this is what we have to remember in strength training a thousand dollar barbell is not gonna get you any stronger than a hundred dollar barbell it's how you use it it can help you get to that point but what you really need is mental motivation and you need consistency and a lot of drugs okay never mind forget the drug but you need a lot of nutrition and things like  that so i'd recommend this rack to a certain person that's on a super budget however i was pleasantly surprised that that could hold that weight all right this is coop from grudge and reviews would you like to see more of these budget reviews we get a question all the time coop you just do the expensive stuff i'm trying to do more budget stuff would you like to see more of it let me know in the comments would you like to see us do a drop test let me know in the comments we'll see you next time peace  [Music] foreign

A53	https://youtu.be/Z8aRn8DdOZ8?si=_GGQ3ROhykzAlDEc	[ __ ] Nation welcome back to our YouTube channel So today we're going to be diving into a very important topic that concerns many of us even all of us which is what contraception because you know that the primary cause of pregnancy is unprotected sex so whether you're here to learn about the options that available to you or you just want to stay informed this particular video is for you but before we jump in don't forget to hit the Subscribe button and press the notification Bell so that you don't miss out on our future videos  because you people know that this University of AO where you come to learn something so let's go into it 10 ways to prevent pregnan from the least to the most effective method number one pull out method the pull out method is Method we all know as withraw method or pull out game like a mea likes to BR about it this is when the male partner withdraws his ear you know from the vagina before ejaculation to prevent pregnancy while it is a method that love to use I am sorry to inform you that this particular method has a high  failure rate compared to other contra ctive methods so even if you think your own is perfect or your pull out game is strong some of you need to go check yourself but we'll come back to that topic later the failure rate of this method is about 27% meaning that the 100 women use this method 27 of them will get pregnant in a year we get now so evil should better repent number two which is an obstructive method is what we call cical C it's a device that covers the cervix and is filled with spermicides spermicides are things that  kill sperms the challenge with this method which is what a lot of people have is that it has to be in the cix before sex and even after sex some people can develop very serious reactions to the spermicide how effective is it it's about 71% effective but keep in mind that they require proper fitting and placement and you probably have to be trained to use it number three condoms but we'll start with the male condoms this one you can find it almost everywhere it is easy to use effective if you use it correctly  correctly the male condom is supposed to prevent pregnancy about 95% of the time but let's come down to rela cuz some of us know that we don't use it correctly 95% of the time we're always using our teeth to Open Condom things like this can actually prevent the correct use of condom and when it's used in real life we find out that it's actually effective about 85% now let's go to female condoms they are also cheap but they are not as common or available as the male condoms you very soon what you're going to do is  go into the street with female condoms and you going to see whether people actually know what female condoms are or not you want us to do that put that in the comment section below waiting for you now how do they work they are placed in the vagina and they block sperms from reaching your G they also offer a different option for people who don't like to use M condoms and have about 95% Effectiveness when used perfectly but because of the kind of training that people need to get in order to use this  particular kind of contraception it may not be up to 95% in real life also some other side effects of condoms is because it's usually made from rubber some people have latest allergies but there are also options where you can use condom that not made from this text we're going to discuss that in another video the four method is very comp amaka I sure you know this method this is the emergency peels or the morning after peill this particular ones are in case of emergencies editor please add emergencies in bold letters because some  people have turned money after pills to vitamin C I said emergency not what you buy and keep before first that's not emergency emergency catches you on awar if this one does not catch you on aware it's not emergency you have time to use all forms of contraception so before you use this particular contraceptive method it should probably be in unforeseen cases cases that were not planned for but let's get back to it for the Emergency contraceptive to work properly it can be taking for up to 72 hours  after unprotected sex and the earlier you use them be better for you what do I mean if you take it during the first 24 hours it will work probably better than the last 72 hours right if you use this often I think it is an opportunity for for you to actually use a more regular contraceptive or longterm solution number five implants now implants just small it's like matches yes what they now do is that they cut your arm and then they put it inside now this implant has some hormones in it that is released  slowly into your blood what do they do it can affect the thickness of your cervical mucus and affect your ovulation so they prevent ovulation and also make your cervical mucus hostile to sperms how how long do they last they can last as long as 5 years in your body with less than a 1% failure rate when used perfectly as you can see right now get to the big boys you want to roll with the big boys they are a great option for people who want stressfree methods how effective are they about 99% effective  but some side effects include weight gain breast tenderness acne breakout irregular periods but remember if you have this particular side effects it will be best to discuss with your doctor in order to take take you Al remember this particular contraceptive methods are bespoke don't say because it worked for my neighbor it should work for me you need to find out the one that fits you perfectly now we'll go to copper IUD or IUD devices these are basically IUD means intrauterine devices they are placed inside the womb it's just small  and is made up of copper and copper is hostile to sperms what it does is that it prevents first of all sperm and then prevents the fertilized egg when it gets fertilized from implanting in to the womb this ones can be used for as long as 10 years how effective about 99% effective there is a senior brother of the copper IUD so it's copper IUD but this one now has hormones in it right so the hormones is working three ways it's preventing ovulation making cervical m scker is hostile to spend so you can see  it's blocking it from every side that's a G man how effective about 99% plus effective and this one usually last a long time time we'll go down to contraceptive pills these ones are the next ones however this particular contraceptive pills is different from the first one you take this one Every Day right also helps you block the cervix by increasing ocus production and then also preventing release of the egg from the ovaries that's Ovation it can also reduce menstrual symptoms and reduce your risk of ovarian cancer yes  is 99% effective if used correctly however because of you have to take it every day some people in kiaka May forget to take a pel and you know you can fall pregnant yes it's about yes I need you pregnant method number seven hormonal injection you guys remember when I talked about the implants right the one that you put under your arm here that releases hormones over a couple of time you know sometimes up to 5 years there's another one just a small injection that you put inject under your skin what does  this do it works almost the same way as the implants right well you have to use them every 3 months it's for people who want a stress-free method but they don't want something very longterm every 3 months you use it you know when you feel like you don't want to use it anymore you can stop and is also very discret it's very small if not everybody needs to know that you're using contraceptives some side effects irregular periods or no periods at all nausea breast tenderness sometimes this effects fade  off over time how effective are they 99% effective now let's move on to the more permanent Solutions you have to sit down with your partner and consider this one carefully because it's usually permanent in nature and the first one is what we call bilateral tubal liation this one is for people who say I don't want to have children again or at all nothing concern me with SH what you can now do is that you go to the hospital and discuss with your doctor then the Fallopian tubes the ones that Supply the eggs into the womb  will now be caught on both sides that's why it's called bilateral right however some people may get ectopic pregnancy in other words some spy food they wear and then they go through you know some people keep going yeah they they spend have L to motivational speaker said that they must get to the goal when they get to the goal because he cannot find his way back into the womb remember the this thing has been caught it can lead to an ectopic pregnancy right a similar method for men is what we call vect this one is  now reversible but the chances of reversal is a bit you know is yeah and de what do they do the tubes that take the sperm into the penise is cut meaning no sperms no pregnancy however if you go for this method you need to understand that for the first 3 months after the vasectomy you do not need to have unprotected sex so you have to use condom because there can still be some sperms lying around after 3 months which is usually the life span of sperms you can now go ahead and have a protect the sex as much as you can you get now  and then the last and the most effective way to prevent pregnancy who wants to get this one Effectiveness 100% there's no you cannot fail if you can type it before I say it I will still say it you know me I don't mind my business abstinance mean this method is not for everybody but it's a valid choice for some people if you know that you are not ready to bring a mea J into the world avoid TW TW that's the one that we Sav so they can avoid all this strong headache but however like I said it's not for everybody so still want the  pleasure of TW TW and you know without the consequences of pregnancy please do that but it's also an option no sex no pregnancy so there you have it the 10 ways to prevent pregnancy especially in 2024 and the effectiveness rate if you know that I try for you people you see you see now that you understand these things it's very easy remember if there's something you think I missed out put a comment I can make a new video about it or you think that there's somebody that this video can help please  share it with them it helps us the more people get to see this video the more they can share the more this video gets shown to more people the more people can learn to prevent because especially in Nigeria I'm talking to you people they said that our population can even be the most populous country in the world by 2025 so there you have it however one last point it is important to consult with a healthcare professional to find out the right method for you and you also need to understand that the  consequence of rather the decision of having or choosing a contraceptive method should not just rely on one partner if you are in a relationship both of you can discuss see what method works for you boths thanks for watching and until next time I'm Mei stay informed stay healthy 
D53	https://youtu.be/YK3fvLH70U0?si=VJ16TDovHpmSSlAe	yo pornography ruined my life at one time I was actually addicted to pornography I was introduced to pornography at a very early age and I am going to be as transparent as possible with you guys because that's how it should be all this fabrication and faking that people went through things or speaking about things they don't know about I don't really subscribe to that I don't like that you know what I'm saying people do all this research and then jump cut and then get on here and talk about stuff they never  experienced I don't subscribe to that well um when I was in high school I think the peak of it was like my 10th grade year I was addicted bad and it ruined many different aspects of my life I didn't really have the confidence to talk to girls in person I didn't really have the mental Clarity to focus on things other than lustful activities and lustful thoughts um sometimes I would e even avoid being around my family just so I could get in the back room and do the deed and it was disgusting I felt  like a shell of a person I was always disgusted with myself I always regretted it and it was just a cheap Outlet to just degeneracy and it felt even worse when you released all these hormones and did all these things but you were still Alone um I didn't have anyone to call mine I'm young like you know what I'm say saying but it was just it was a disgustful or disgusting period of time and it was bad man I would I would go to school and these girls certain girls would flirt with me and I would go  on on the Hub and find someone that looked identical to him like you could literally find anything you want on there it's it's pretty crazy the um access you have on the internet and it's it's dangerous but it got bad man it was almost like every day I was getting it in and I I noticed a difference in my physical health now always been in shape but I'm telling you bro I used to work out so much but I would also release so much my gains never change now yes I made some some increases and I was growing too as a young male but when I  stopped bro I didn't have to work out nearly as much and retain muscle and all this stuff but it got to the point where I was just so disgusted with myself and iend up I stumbled on a video I wish I could remember so I could shout out to whoever it was but I seen the concept of seing retention and then I heard something about Mike Tyson doing it and this and that so I wanted to try it out two days went by I relapse I went like a day after that relapsed again then after that I went a week relapsed again after  that I went like two weeks without um you know releasing and I relapsed again and then after that I went on a eight Monon stretch without releasing and when I did it was not you know with my hand and man in that period of time people look it's not a superpower to retain and all this stuff it eventually it can be but it's not going to make you glow it's not it's the it's it's the byproduct of doing those things conquering yourself that's what I like to call it when you conquer yourself you conquer Your Lust when you conquer your  desires That's What Makes You glow that that energy that's was with inside of you you know what I'm saying people not just going to walk to you're retaining you know maybe now since it's such a a talked about theme but they going to be like man it's just something about you man or you know what I'm saying even if they don't you feel better about yourself when you learn to control your desires and not dig into that life but um over the course of those eight months especially after that first few weeks  and the first months and stuff those desires started to lessen right and I began to conquer myself and I instead of being so bored and staying up at 3:00 at night and you know finding an activity to help me out I start filling my time in with more meaningful things even just playing the game sometimes I just feel in that space get so busy to where you don't have time to be distracted to where you don't have time to touch it you know what I mean when you get tired lay down put the phone away but over the  course of those eight months I felt like a superhero um one of the things that helped me out was deleting the distractions it's hard to get distracted if there's no distractions any girls I would see that was half naked on Snapchat Instagram I would unfollow them delete them and still to this day I have accounts that um were on my social medias that I didn't even know how they got there some people buy out meme accounts and turn them into explicit content Pages cuz they know they trap a lot of Mind vulnerable minds and I've  had relationship issues about this thing I'm like look I've been in that place before I'm not going back there so you're not going to tell me that I'm some lustful human being and I'm conquered by lust around the earth because cuz I was that at one point in time and I hated that I was disgusted by that and I took the shadowy path to go conquer myself and go through that right so I'm not lying to you by telling you I don't indulge in these things I'm being truthful I went like I was disgusted I hated myself for those  things you understand what I'm saying it was disgusting disgusting to me and I hated it so I decided to make a change and like I said over the course of those months it was just bro life changing I I gained more confidence in that time I actually created an ultimate ego called HBK Manon that had confidence he uh had conversation skills he was able to talk to girls and you know he stopped touching himself and all this stuff I'm if I'm going to release it ain't going to be by me like you know what I'm saying I'm just telling myself  all these little things creating all these little nuances and it actually worked and it got to the point where I truly just stop Desiring any of that right now what you can run into is when you stop the desires may come you know more intense the pleasure in doing you know the real thing the real deed it becomes more pleasurable but you just have to find a balance man eliminate those distractions just resist it man choose not to do it a lot of of us get addicted and we think it's no way out and we think it's too hard to quit all  these things but the easiest part is just deciding not to quit or the hardest part is deciding not to quit or deciding to quit if you're addicted decide to not be addicted decide to quit drugs decide to quit porn that's what you need to do but instead we go man I just can't man it's like I'm I'm too you know I'm too deep in I I can't stop now you have to change your mindset become my my philosophy in life or one of them is become disgusted in what's not good for you if that's keeping around people if  that's watching pornography if that's doing this doing that become disgusted in it right when your mom tried to give you that nasty medicine what you do nasty that's how it should be for your life right porn following all these girls dming all these girls just caving into this lust we scrolling on Tik Tock they got accounts bro it's insane they literally are manip ulating the male mind it's nothing wrong with looking at a girl it's nothing wrong with being attracted to a girl but what the problem is is you allowing your  natural ability your natural instinct to be taken over and used against you like you're not supposed to be horny all the time you're not supposed to be you know what I'm saying this big ball of horniness all the time but social media is overly saturated with women who are chiseled by the God's you have to choose to remove yourself from that you have to choose to stop liking those videos and start training your algorithms to show you things that matter scrolling on social media and all this stuff is already bad enough but you  going to just add fuel to the fire that's why it takes accountability I know the title may be misleading pornography ruined my life but I ruined my life through pornography I ruined my life through lust I chose to change right I'm no longer addicted I like I said I'm I've been out of high school for x amount of years right I'm 20 by the way but it was like my S my my freshman and sophomore year I was heavily addicted to that stuff and I quit and I would Advocate to my friends and you know people I was close to or  came across like yo you ever you know what I'm saying you have any problems with this and I would advocate for it and try to help people because I know what it did for me and and I noticed when I see dudes or not confident and I man yo I had to I had to get one off and it's like yo it it's more to life bro it's more to life now what I will Advocate on I would much rather you uh you know do it yourself then you go make a crazy decision and go touch something that you wouldn't touch with a 10-ft pole or to go touch  something that may leave you with you know a STD a sexually transmitted disease or a sexually transmitted demon I would much rather you do that that's where balance comes in um I'm not going to ever advocate for watching porn um touching yourself is is kind of iffy when it comes to balance cuz sometimes you you know it's best to get things you know released but there should always be a balance in everything you do you understand what I'm saying but the journey with seing retention maybe it is unbalanced because you have  so many things you have to break away from you have to just shut down and go celibate celan is not some type of gold it's a lifestyle so you can't really dig in and now you have to go and turn this thing into a lifestyle you know quitting until you can reap those benefits and then you can

You see, there's a shadowy cabal that conspires against you. Expose them. Conspires against you. And every time I hear their whispers. Open your eyes. Wake up. I blow the trumpet. Shall a trumpet be blown in the city and the people not be afraid? I blow the trumpet.   And that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition. Eyes to see, ears to hear. Shalom, family. Welcome to Shattered Paradise. Cuts from the archive.   Wow, the truth is really coming to the light in these last days. Well, at least for those of us who are able to connect the dots. In the past, we've seen the elites utilize sophisticated social and psychological warfare strategies against the masses. Psyops like the Hegelian dialectic, implementing order out of chaos. But today, it seems they believe the general public, the masses,   are so dumbed down, they no longer have to use complex and expensive social engineering techniques to manipulate the people when simple reverse psychology will do the trick. Rapper Snoop Dogg and Master P are taking on two giants in the retail world, Walmart and the Post Cereal Company. As NBC4's Gordon Tokumatsu reports, their lawsuit is all about shelf space and connecting fans to Snoop's new cereal brand.   Legendary rapper Snoop Dogg, whose real name is Calvin Brodus, via video this morning, part of a news conference with his business partner, rapper Master P, where the two of them announced they're suing serial giant Post and retail leader Walmart. This is about...   Minority-owned companies getting a fair share at issue is anecdotal video evidence from fans across the country They've been wondering says attorney Ben Crump why they can't find Snoop cereal on Walmart shelves dozens   of Walmarts all around America. Everybody went saying, where's Snoop's cereal? In the retail game, product placement is very important. Where is it in the store and who can see it? That shelf space in any supermarket first is worth millions and is very, very limited.   But in the video, Crump alleges that Snoop's, Fruity Hoops, Cinnamon Toasties, and others are being hidden from customers, sitting on stockroom shelves in the back of the stores, while Post brands and others remain on display out front. Today, Crump filed a lawsuit on behalf of the rappers. Among their claims against Walmart and Post, breach of contract, fraud, collusion, and conspiracy. We asked him, though, why Walmart would hide a product that could potentially make millions of dollars for the retail chain.   I just want to show you, this is Kellogg's Frosted Flakes and this is Kellogg's Zuccaritas. So in the version that's not aimed at the Hispanic population, you have milled corn sugar malt flavor contains 2% less of salt. And the ones that are being promoted to Hispanic population, you have milled corn sugar malt flavor contains 2% less of salt BHT.   right why are they doing that so this is up on the environmental working group website and it's talking specifically about bha and bht butylated hydroxy anisole and butylated hydroxy toluene but these are additives that have been shown to cause hormone disruption and harm the reproductive system and harm the reproductive system   and harm the reproductive system. And it says down here specifically about BHT that it may disrupt endocrine function by causing thyroid changes and affecting animal development, according to the European Food Safety Authority. And that studies on rats fed BHT found they developed liver and lung tumors.   So this is something that is not allowed in many countries in Europe, also Japan, banned from food. That is how dangerous other countries have acknowledged that this stuff is. They're still putting this in their products. They obviously they can make this, okay, without that. Clearly they can. So why are they putting BHT in the one and not the other? Ask yourself.   They want us to think that the man is trying to stop us from getting this cereal so we will fight harder to find it. Reverse psychology. Reverse psychology.   It is not a coincidence that Snoop Dogg's BHT-laced infertility loops are being pushed to the forefront at the exact same time Kellogg's Cereal for Dinner campaign is in full swing, which is messaging to low-income families that cereal is a cheap viable alternative to a complete nutrition-rich dinner.   The cereal category has always been quite affordable and it tends to be a great destination when consumers are under pressure. So some of the things that we're doing is first messaging. We've got to reach the consumer where they are. So we're advertising about cereal for dinner. If you think about the cost of cereal for a family versus what they might otherwise do, that's going to be much more affordable.   The cereal category is a place that a lot of folks might come to because the price of a bowl of cereal with milk and with fruit is less than a dollar. So you can imagine why a consumer under pressure might find that to be a good place to go. Right. I'm all for innovation and marketing, but the idea of having cereal for dinner, is there the potential for that to land the wrong way?   We don't think so. In fact, it's landing really well right now, Carl. Cereal for dinner is something that is probably more on trend now, and we would expect to continue as that consumer is under pressure. When I say cereal, you say dinner. Cereal! Dinner! Cereal! Dinner! Chicken! You can have the night off, chicken. Okay, I'll go marinate. Cereal! Dinner! Cereal! Dinner!   Though the eugenics population control arm of the New World Order is targeting the so-called blacks, Hispanics, and Native Americans, these groups are just being subjected to a double dose of what the whole working class population of America is being exposed to.   Might want to put that box of Cheerios back on the shelf if you're interested in your health. A staggering four out of five Americans are being exposed to a dangerous chemical linked to reduced fertility, altered fetal growth, and delayed puberty. Those chemicals are reportedly on a huge number of popular oat-based foods in America, including Cheerios and Quaker Oats.   In a study of the chemical chloroquat, a lot of these chemicals are obviously not good for our bodies. And I don't think it's any coincidence that we've seen a rise in chronic illnesses, in diabetes, obesity throughout our country as our food supply has gotten away from whole foods and more into these types of boxed prepackaged goods. Yeah, what happened to, I thought it was Quaker Oats. He's supposed to be a pacifist and his Cheerios are poisoning us.   And they're making us gay, puberty blockers, infertility. And they're making us gay, puberty blockers, infertility. The Long Beach rapper and his fellow musician turned businessman, Master P, are taking legal action against a major retailer they claim they've been discriminated against.   Please people, don't fall for this rudimentary reverse psychology attempt to paint these two played out puppets of the deep state as some kind of innocent victims of discrimination. This is an obvious attempt to target a specific demographic with a cocktail of gender-bending infertility chemicals disguised as a colorful and fun nutritious breakfast brought to you by two disadvantaged black entrepreneurs.   It's imperative you learn how to spot a Psy up. And this is a good place to start. I mean, it's hidden in plain sight. The ninth song of Snoop Dogg's debut album, Doggystyle, is even titled Serial Killer.   21 oat-based cereals and snack products popular with kids contain traces amount of this chemical, which is the active ingredient in the weed killer Roundup. For those of us who reside in the Western world, we are currently living through a catastrophically devastating manufactured gender war, which, at the highest, most metaphysical level, is being fueled by spiritual forces, ritual, sorcery, and witchcraft.   But at the physical level, it's driven by the hormonal biochemical transformation of our biology and environment, especially through the products many rely on for nutrition, our food. All right, Kellogg's is getting ready to celebrate Pride Month. A new heart-shaped cereal is coming out next month. And what is the end result of all this feminizing and emasculation on a society?   It'll be available for a limited time, and the cereal is berry-flavored, and the colorful pieces there, they're topped with glitter. For each box sold, Kellogg's says it's donated $3 to GLAAD, which helps with LGBTQ acceptance. And by the way, Pride Month is in June. And what is the end result? Despite all the challenges we face, I remain convinced that yes, the future is female.   Did you just put a cigarette into his mouth? That's... Oh, it's the video, if that's okay. I'm not judging. You're both consenting adults. Can I please capture your interactions? Thank you. Very kind of you. I wish everyone was as cool as this. So, ladies and gentlemen, we have two consenting adults role-playing in public. And I'd like to be offended, but they're two consenting adults, and I support their freedom.   But the viewers will be wondering, what is going on? What is going on? Female supremacy? Beta male? Are you a beta male? Okay, as the beta... Oh.   well i won't judge but does that not hurt the cigarette ash in your tongue is it okay if i speak to and can you answer questions what oh my phone's ringing um quickly what do you get out of it humiliation   Alright, so what's in a name? Hollywood's leading men have been called a lot of them. But now there is a new one that is making the rounds on social media. Baby girl. And experts say it is actually meant as a compliment. What does the term baby girl mean and why is it being applied to male actors or male presenting characters?   Good morning, Valerie and Joe. So baby girl, you know, I kind of think of it as a catch-all term, but it does have some specific attributes. It could be applied to someone who is vulnerable and also kind of has a submissive personality, or it could be applied to a man who is burly, surly, and the complete opposite of what we think of as baby girl.   This seems to be the year of baby girl. We've seen it really take off again around shows like The Last of Us, Succession, but we actually don't know who coined the phrase first. There's a lot of researchers who look for the origins of these certain words. We're just not sure where baby girl started, but we know that 2017 is sort of when we first started seeing it applied in this way. And some language scholars are actually applauding the term. Why is that?   Yeah, I spoke with a linguist who said, you know, typically female-sounding terms, when they're applied to, like, heteronormative men, we tend to think of that in our culture as a negative thing. Baby girl is thought of as a real positive thing, and it's sort of this feminine term that's applied to heteronormative men in a positive way. It's a way that our language is becoming more gender-inclusive and gender-fluid, and we're seeing that the way the Internet is expecting that in real time. It's really cool just to see how our language changes and evolves and sort of becomes...   more equal as time goes on. There's something in the water.   As you can see, the assault on masculinity is a spiritual obsession with the elites, but this demonic impulse does not stay in the elite circles, but is now disseminated in the most common public spaces in Western society.   This video was filmed at the Mall of America located in Minnesota. The obscene name of this drag performer which is boldly showcased on a massive jumbotron in a shopping center full of children illustrates their aggressive indoctrination campaign is accelerating.   Daddy, can you play Princess Princess with me? Sweetheart, I'd love to, but the guys, they're outside waiting for me. We've got to eat those. Steve, what is the hold up? Go, Neil! Go, Neil! Is that my wedding dress? It could be.   A six-foot-plus male basketball player at KIPP Academy in Massachusetts suited up for the school's women's team and injured multiple opposing players, which resulted in forfeiture at halftime. Now, you would think after being forced to halt play mid-game due to injuries sustained from competing against a male that the collegiate charter school of Lowell would go scorched earth in its response.   No, an opportunity to appear progressive simply could not be passed up. Stating, the charter school reiterates its values to inclusivity and safety. We also follow the state laws regarding equity for all student athletes.   Here, Kraft Mac and Cheese is openly illustrating the transformative effects of consuming their product, proudly showcasing that the food is not only unhealthy, but it's a gateway to the demonic. Predictive programming. Predictive programming.   X marks the spot. As the second great American eclipse quickly approaches, signifying biblical judgment, many Illuminists are either checking out or going into hiding. In light of the recent death of Lord Jacob Rothschild, 4th Baron Rothschild, there seems to be an acceleration in what Freemasonic thinkers refer to as the Great Work, the synthesis of dualistic opposites.   In recent years, some of the most powerful members of the Blue Blood aristocracy and the Illuminati ruling class have seemingly died of old age in so-called natural causes, leaving behind a tapestry of clues in the form of signs and symbols which adorn the architecture and walls of the globalist foundations and New World Order institutions they founded and left behind.   This year, at the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, while former UK Prime Minister Theresa May was addressing a room full of global elites, a few 
M53	https://youtu.be/Ok-AZtt33Bo?si=dGkOCQTsSssmXtx1	belly fat is really easy to gain yet often the hardest area to lose and there's actually two types there's that annoying belly fat we all know that covers your abs but there's also a more dangerous type of belly fat stored deep within your organs known as visceral fat which can create serious health problems to find the most effective way to get rid of both types of belly fat I reached out to five of the world's most qualified phalla scientists and came up with five easy steps anyone can start doing today to lose belly fat for the  first and most important step I spoke to lay Norton scientific researcher Champion powerlifter and honestly just a really smart dude who calls out BS when he sees it so why is stored belly fat so difficult to lose once again we don't know the exact scientific explanation for that but it may have something to do with the tissue being a little bit more metabolically active than other forms of stored body fat now the real question is is there any way around that well yes kinda of sadly even though we'd like to  think if we do a bunch of crutches and work the area where the fat is stored it will preferentially Target that fat there is no evidence to support that idea and it's unlikely that that would make a difference overall now there is research showing that exercise can reduce visceral fat without actually causing weight loss so it is a good idea to exercise in general but specific exercises are not going to Target preferentially belly fat per se I know people don't want to hear this the real key to losing belly fat is just getting  into a caloric deficit consistently and doing it for long enough now the most effective way to create the calorie deficit Lane talked about is by modifying your diet that's where our next expert comes in Alan Aragon Allen is one of the world's top nutrition researchers and Educators with over 30 years of success in the field he recommends first find out roughly how many calories you eat in a day next find out how many calories you should be eating to lose fat which you can do by using the free calculator I've made over  at builtwithsize.com calculator then simply try to close that Gap over time with most of your Foods coming from the following sources you have to be eating the foods that you like and look forward to people have an idea of what their 20 favorite foods are that's honestly that that's what they should be eating that's what they should be eating if people freak out when they hear that but hey man if you love the foods that you're eating you're gonna stick to your diet it helps to have an awareness of  the food groups as well because when I say your 20 favorite foods I mean your 20 favorite foods that are reasonably healthy choices across the food groups and there's six of them there's the the meat or the high protein group there's the fat group there's the fibrous vegetable group and there's the starch group and then there's the milk group and then there's the fruit group so choose your three favorite foods across like in each of those food groups choose your three favorite three favorite ones you like the most  and there's your diet man there's your diet oh oh wait we have two two more Foods left to get those 20 Foods choose your two favorite YOLO Foods your two favorite desserts or whatever or what you like wine okay wine and freaking cookies or something you know brownies and ice cream whatever um and that's a healthy diet right there that'll hold you down for for life and not just a dieting phase I love that approach I've never actually heard somebody put it like that um but now what about protein intake how  important would you say protein intake is for losing belly fat just losing fat in general protein intake adequate protein is crucial among the macronutrients it helps you preserve muscle mass it's the most potent thereof because it's protein is a muscle mass is protein and this is sort of a side thing that's a little bit trivial but protein has the highest energetic cost of processing within the body and so um in you know in theory you take a a diet that's a hundred percent protein then your body will spend about 30  percent of those calories just trying to process it and and so it's like that's not necessarily the case with carbohydrate and fat this helps from the standpoint of um a a weight and fat loss perspective it doesn't have to be a a tough thing to to try to accomplish even I mean on the low end if you consume 1.6 grams per kilogram of body weight which is 0.7 grams per pound of body weight then you are at an adequate starting point and the last question I had is uh what about visceral fat are there any kinds of  foods that promote the storage of visceral fat and are there foods that people can eat to avoid getting that yeah man that is a great question and researchers have been fighting over the answer to this question for a really long time okay so the overarching answer that covers a lot of things is that if you're losing fat um or if you're getting lean there's really no concern about visceral fat because if you're losing overall fat then visceral fat is diminishing as well it's not like that's gonna hold steady you know  principle number two is that visceral fat is mainly a concern for people who are who are gaining fat and um there's actually a study by rosquist and colleagues where they compared what types of dietary fat most influence visceral fat they compare to polyunsaturated fat source with a saturated fat Source it was a hyper caloric experiment which where the subjects were eating more calories and the saturated fat Rich diet that resulted in in Greater visceral fat accumulation than the polyunsaturated  fat Rich diet alright so you've got your nutrition plan but now let's talk what exercise as Lane mentioned earlier exercise can burn off that dangerous visceral fat even if you don't lose any weight but the right type of exercise can also help you avoid regaining belly fat as soon as your diet is over to explain this is Eric Trexler Pro natural bodybuilder and published scientist with a PhD in human movement science so usually when people are trying to lose belly fat but they automatically think  that they have to do a bunch of cardio but how about resistance training like how important is lifting weights for someone who's interested in losing belly fat so I'd say it's really important there are some major benefits of resistance training if you're trying to lose belly fat and really just trying to lose fat in general so first of all if you're lifting during this fat loss phase there's a very high likelihood that you are going to reduce the amount of muscle loss that occurs during that weight loss and that can be great great  for two reasons so a lot of people who don't lift weights and just do fat loss they often find that they end up looking more skinny and less shredded than they were hoping at the end so retaining muscle can be great for maintaining definition there's also been some really good research in the last couple years indicating that the more muscle or the more lean mass you lose during a diet the more hunger you tend to experience later on and the higher likelihood that you're actually going to regain some of  the fat that you lost later right and then let's say somebody is you know lifting weights regularly how does cardio now fit into the picture I mean it definitely like has a lot of benefits for your health that lifting weights doesn't necessarily provide but how much does it help when trying to lose belly fat the reality is you don't need cardio in order to lose fat or to lose belly fat but cardio can be a helpful thing and one of the reasons for that is energy expenditure has a tendency to go down during a fat loss phase so of  course there will be some reduction normally in resting metabolic rate but non-exercise activity thermogenesis is another really key thing that can change during a fat loss phase so non-exercise activity is basically everything that exists between resting and doing structured exercise so walking to the mailbox walking around at your work or your school um you know anything that fits between those two extremes of exercising on purpose office and uh you know just kind of totally resting It's usually the  second biggest contributor to Total daily energy expenditure for most people and so unfortunately when we diet a lot of people notice their non-exercise activity thermogenesis goes down pretty significantly uh so cardio can be a really helpful thing in keeping your expenditure higher when that non-exercise activity starts to go down over time so you're just trying to kind of keep things steady by adding some cardio to the mix for some people it's even just purely behavioral we might just say hey use the stairs instead of  the elevator and park at the back of the parking lot instead of the front so everything that that gets you moving counts but even with proper nutrition that exercise a recent 2022 study found there's an often overlooked variable that can still prevent you from losing belly fat to explain this study is exercise science professor and body composition researcher Bill Campbell that this new study was very unique in that it was the first ever investigation to assess a lack of sleep and how it affects where body fat is stored they  took 12 healthy males and females who on average slept about seven and a half hours per night they had these subjects live in a research sleep lab and then place them into two different sleep conditions the first condition was a sleep restricted condition where they were allowed to sleep only four hours per night the other condition was a normal sleep condition where they were allowed to sleep nine hours per night and during this entire process they were allowed to eat as much and whatever food  they wanted to eat so after two weeks in each condition here's what happened the Sleep restricted subjects on average consumed 300 more calories per day and they gained about a pound of body weight when compared to the subjects when they were in the normal sleep stage but here's where things get really interesting the subjects that were sleep restricted they gained eight percent more subcutaneous body fat and then the normal sleep condition they only gained about four percent the other part of our bellies that  stores fat is called the visceral region or visceral body fat and that's the dangerous body fat because that's associated with a lot of adverse Health outcomes the Sleep restricted condition caused an increase in 11 of this visceral body fat and the normal sleep condition they didn't gain any now again we would expect they had they ate more calories they gained a little bit more body weight so we would expect a little bit of a gain in body fat but not nearly to the extent that we saw as it was localized to the belly region to the  abdominal region so this study suggests that there may be a link to sleep restriction leading to overeating which causes a gain in body fat that is preferentially stored in the belly region so my takeaway from this is to make sure that you prioritize sleep I would suggest that you get about seven hours per night and that you do not Overlook the importance of this now I know some of you might be thinking okay well the subjects were overeating what about if I'm still in a calorie deficit this sleep still matter as much  and that's a valid question and a 2010 study actually tested this researchers put two groups of subjects on a weight loss diet with the same amount of calories the only difference was one group slept eight and a half hours per night while the other group slept only five and a half hours per night the result both groups lost a similar amount of total weight both groups also did lose some muscle because they weren't lifting weights but the well-slapped group lost 1.6 times less muscle and lost 2.3 times more fat than the Sleep  restricted group suggesting that a lack of sleep alone may in fact lead to more muscle loss and less fat loss during a diet so you've now got all the tools you need to lose belly fat but there's one more thing you need to add to your plant failure to do this is why so many people start out strong yet never end up successfully losing their belly fat Lauren conlon a master coach exercise scientist and ifbb bikini Pro will help explain what this missing piece is all right let's go through what commonly  happens so a client is going to obsess over losing belly fat even if they have seen some changes on the scale or seen improvements in other areas of the body since there hadn't been much change in their belly fat they are going to feel like what they're doing isn't working or it's not happening fast enough some clients are just going to give up right then While others are going to slash their calories or increase their cardio this increase in their deficit is typically unsustainable though so they're going to fall off plan and  inevitably quit first it's important to recognize that unless genetically you have little body fat on your abs and core area that you will probably need to get leaner than you'd think to lose belly fat for many people the belly is the last area we're going to see fat come off but in the meantime you can pay attention and be proud of the progress you've made in other areas like your face and your shoulders and your legs and trust that if you remain patient but eventually you'll start to see more and  more progress in these problematic and stubborn areas second take multiple measures of progress you can use scale weight and measurements as quantitative feedback but we also want to look at qualitative feedback such as how your clothes are fitting how you're looking and how much better that you're feeling don't just obsess over your belly and and lastly and probably most importantly out of this entire video be patient and recognize that you're usually quitting right before it gets good okay it  doesn't matter how perfect your program is unless you are patient and remain consistent you are shortchanging yourself and your results you owe it to yourself to make this change so don't give up follow or create a great program adjust it when it's necessary and take your time your belly fat didn't get there overnight so you're not gonna lose it in a few weeks either I want to give a huge thank you to all five of the experts who help with the video Guys these five truly are the best of the best I've been following and  looking up to them for many years ever since I started my own fitness journey so being

P53	https://youtu.be/LYCHHYFS3gA?si=CoTmsvlif72-3Wbv	 Let's talk about the fastest way to get rid of acne. If you have acne, you are gonna be happy that you found this video. All it takes is the correct knowledge. Now, when I was, I think seventh grade, eighth grade, I had severe acne. And talk about devastating someone's confidence. I mean, it's already hard enough to be a teenager, but to have acne on top of being an awkward teenager,   Devastating. Remember I was in sixth grade, had no acne, right?   I didn't even like girls. And then all of a sudden in seventh grade, I started liking girls, but I had acne and that persisted in eighth grade, ninth grade, 10th grade, 11th grade. So it was, it can be very devastating. So I really wish I knew what I know now, back then it would have came in handy. All I knew back then was to keep washing your face, using creams, even though it didn't work. And we just keep trying it over and over and over.   Here's the big problem. If we actually do a search on acne, let's take something that's very credible, right? Wikipedia, right? I'm being very sarcastic. Let's see what Wikipedia says about acne here. Acne is a long-term skin condition that occurs when dead skin cells...   and oil from your skin clog your hair follicles. The resulting appearance can lead to anxiety, reduced self-esteem, and extreme cases, depression, or even thoughts of suicide. But check this out. Susceptibility to acne is primarily genetics in 80% of cases. Now, notice that they said   susceptibility to acne. They didn't say acne. That is because there's something way more powerful than your genetics, and that's called epigenetics, which I'm going to get into. It says the roles of diet and cigarette smoking in the condition are unclear, and neither cleanliness nor exposure to sunlight appear to play a part. Eating fewer simple carbohydrates, such as   sugar may minimize the condition. Okay. So that's, at least they mentioned that. All right. And then they get into the causes of possible secondary contributors include hormones, infections, diet, and stress. All right. And then we get to diet. It says high glycemic load diets have been found to have different degrees of   of effect on acne severity so one of the studies that they mentioned um diet and acne update carbohydrates emerge as the main culprit of course they're not going to emphasize that and then they go right into multiple randomized control trials and non-randomized studies   have found a lower glycemic load diet to be effective in reducing acne. So the rest of this page is just more confusion, more information that doesn't really tell you or differentiate the important stuff from the trivial stuff to the stuff that's completely and utterly false. So no wonder why people have a hard time finding answers. So if we take a look at   acne, what it is. We have an infection of a sebaceous gland. Okay. A sebaceous gland is the oil glands in your skin. And so this is why you have redness. That's inflammation. You have many times a white pustule, which is an infection, which has bacteria and white blood cells. And you're   I need to pop that zit, right? And then clean it out and then it'll go away, but it never goes away. It comes back. It turns into a scar. Okay. Now you have a pockmark and it keeps coming back. So what is behind this infection of the sebaceous gland? And the answer is a hormone called androgens. Androgens are two   I mean, think about what happens during puberty. You have this shift of androgens, right? Mostly in men. It's also a spike in girls as well. Okay. But they also have a spike in estrogen, which can also trigger acne as well. So is the problem just puberty and everyone has to go through it? Or is there something we can do?   Well, there's some extra data about androgens that I want to talk about that's going to help you isolate what's really going on. But I'm going to recommend that you stop popping your zits, okay? Because that's going to just create more of an infection. It's going to create more redness, more inflammation, and more scarring, okay? And it's very difficult to get rid of old scars. There's things you can do, but it's not the easiest thing in the world to do. And the   Don't want to pop the zits. We want to find the underlying cause. So what are all the things that can cause an increase in androgens? Well, there's a protein in your liver. There's a certain protein. I don't want to give you the long name, but the acronym is SHBG. This protein helps you bind...   both estrogen and testosterone so if you have enough of this protein it keeps these two hormones locked up and in the inactive form because if you have too much free estrogen and too much free testosterone it can be very dangerous for various reasons but you just don't want a lot of active   testosterone and a lot of active estrogen floating around through your bloodstream. So the body tends to lock up about 99% of all of it. And only one to 2% of it is free. And so they found people that have bad acne have very low levels of this protein. Okay. There's just not enough to bind it. So they're having more free testosterone and then that excess androgen is going to then cause more   enlargement of the sebaceous gland, more oil, more infection, more bacteria, etc. Now, the big question is, what causes low amounts of this protein to exist? And the answer is, you ready for this? Are you sitting down?   high insulin or insulin resistance. That means high amounts of carbohydrates in your diet, as in teenagers consuming a lot of carbohydrates and sugar. In fact, an average teenager consumes the most carbohydrate of any point in their life right at that point in the   so much carbohydrate into their system on top of an already existing high level of androgen. So it's just the perfect storm for developing acne. Now, a couple other things that can do it. A fatty liver. The more fat you have on your liver, the less of that binding protein you're going to have, okay? Inflammation in the liver. And so as you can see, the liver is really, really important in the regulation of these hormones.   Now, a couple other things can do it. If you have a low thyroid, which usually is caused by either a liver problem or high levels of estrogen, because people don't usually have a primary thyroid problem. It's usually caused by something else. And a fatty liver could do it or high levels of estrogen could do it. Also, high cortisol, as in stress, can make things worse and increase more available fat.   testosterone, thereby triggering more of the acne. All right. So that's number one. And the solution is very, very simple. Stop eating the sugar and the carbs. Okay. Get on a healthy keto plan. Stop snacking. That's a big one, especially for teenagers. And also start doing intermittent fasting. Those three things.   It's going to be the common thread to this video, but very, very important. Milk thistle is a fantastic natural herb to help the liver rejuvenate, recover, as well as to normalize that protein. Not to mention, it can help you remove fat from the liver as well. So milk thistle is a great thing for acne for these reasons. All right, number two.   Just high insulin in general, not having anything to do with the liver will then increase your androgens. I mean, take a look at a condition called polycystic ovarian syndrome, very common in women. Where does that come from? High levels of insulin.   They nearly always have high insulin resistance, which actually is gonna allow the body to pump out more insulin. And if they can just cut down the carbs, okay, stop snacking and do intermittent fasting, those three things, bam.   the problem goes away. So if you have acne, you need to start to do that. A really good herb, and you can get this as a tea as well, is berberine. Berberine works very similar to metformin. Okay. What is metformin? That's a medication for diabetes and it works   to help get in check insulin resistance. And the interesting thing is berberine is almost equivalent in function, but without the toxicity. There's side effects from medications. But if you look up the relationship between metformin and getting rid of acne,   It's a great way to get rid of acne, but the problem is it's medication. So why can't we just use a natural form of metformin with less toxicity? All right, so, so far we have lower that binding protein by doing low carb, no snacking, fasting, milk thistle. Then if we add berberine on top of that, now we're really gonna see some nice, cool changes. Now there's a couple other things that they're gonna happen when you start doing this.   The gland, which is kind of in a large state, is going to start to shrink and reducing the oil that's in the gland too. Green tea. Green tea actually handles every potential pathogenic cause of acne. I mean, it reduces inflammation. It actually is great as an antibacterial.   It reduces the sebaceous gland directly as well as its oil. It also helps with insulin resistance and it makes insulin more sensitive so then it can help reduce insulin. So green tea is a very, very important remedy in acne as well. You can even probably get it as a cream and put it topically as well. And the last little remedy I would recommend is zinc and copper. Sometimes you just get it in a trace mineral blend.   But zinc and copper, a deficiency of zinc, also a deficiency of copper can be one of the primary root causes of acne. You need both. In fact, you need zinc to help you absorb vitamin A, which is essential for your skin and also to prevent acne. But copper is involved in a very powerful antioxidant, okay?   It's called SOD. And copper goes in there and cleans up all the oxidation that's occurring in the skin from all the inflammation and the oxidative stress. So copper is a very powerful antioxidant that can help reduce inflammation. And it works with zinc. All right, and I have a few more points here. Don't pop your zits anymore, okay? Just do this protocol. Don't over-clean your skin. Don't scrub your skin. It's not the dirt.   That's the problem. In fact, when you scrub your skin, you're going to get rid of all the good friendly bacteria that's there to protect you. And now you have this redness in your face. So don't over clean your skin. Also, when you take a shower, get a filter to filter out fluoride. Fluoride is very, very irritating to the skin. Now, it's not going to cause the type of acne that maybe you have right now, but it can keep your skin dry.   kind of red and irritated. So just get some filter to pull out that fluorine. That's just as a side note. It's not the main thing you should do, but it's one of the things that it's very important. The other thing to avoid is milk. Milk has a lot of hormones, including both androgens as well as estrogens. It's a growth hormone. So I would highly recommend you avoid dairy for a while. That right there might help you greatly. And then if you have...   these scars on your skin, get a real high quality vitamin E oil and rub it into the skin before you go to bed every night. And there's another great product for scarring that was very successful when I was in practice. It's called Dermatrophin PMG. Dermatrophin PMG. It's a standard process product. And you just take one before bed for maybe six months if it's really bad or three months if it's a moderate problem.   All right, so now you need the details of how to do the low carb and the no snacking, okay? For that, I put a very simple playlist right here. Check it out, get started, and then come back to this video and report to me of your great success. 
S53	https://youtu.be/ay7lKsiIsbs?si=ip4wbwCILaR0pJAs	learning how to last as long as I wanted in the bedroom has completely changed my sex life forever and I want you to be able to experience it too so in this video I'm going to share seven tricks to last longer in bed and the rules to live by to ensure you don't experience PE ever again and make sure you stick around for number seven because this is a rule that 99 of men get wrong and is going to be the key to truly understanding how to last longer during sex so make sure you watch this video till the end okay so let's jump right  into this video so you can start lasting longer in bed tonight number one don't have sex while you're in fear if you are feeling fear and anxiety leading up to sex and right before sex don't do it if you want to be able to experience deep pleasure and be relaxed and in complete control you can't be in a fear state so if you're freaking out at dinner knowing she wants to come home with you and you can't calm down and you're in near Panic don't do it you are not ready yet or maybe you don't feel safe with this  partner which brings us to number two releasing shame and guilt if you are desperately trying to hide the fact that you experience premature ejaculation with Partners this will create attention in your body and an anxiety and overthinking which in most cases will only make your premature ejaculation even worse being able to share with your partner that you want to take things slower and that you need to feel safe in order to have sex and that sometimes you can experience performance anxiety can  be a huge weight off your shoulders and that alone can be enough to be able to last longer in bed but hiding that secret and trying to cover it up all the time is so much more taxing on your body and mind than you think and if you think your partner wouldn't be able to accept you or support you when you share this then ask yourself is that really the kind of partner you want to be with and I have had countless men in my program cure their premature ejaculation just from having this type of conversation  with their partner number three stop masturbating to porn porn is designed to get you aroused and to ejaculation as quickly as possible so if you're masturbating every night to porn or even multiple times per day you are essentially training yourself to prematurely ejaculate so stop watching porn and see if you can adopt a self-pleasure practice that is more focused on your entire body and incorporates edging and prolonging ejaculation as opposed to going as quickly as possible this alone will have  a huge impact on your ability to last longer number four connect to your breath connect to your breath before foreplay even starts if you're getting nervous I want you to be able to regulate your nervous system and take make big inhales through the nose and into your belly and then nice long exhales through the mouth with sound this will help you drop into a more relaxed State and enable you to get out of your head and back into your body if you're feeling relaxed before sex and are not feeling fear that's the green  light to do it but make sure you are connected to your breath throughout the entire process during foreplay while she's touching your chest or going down on you staying connected to your breath the entire time and this will help you move your energy so it doesn't stagnate in your genitals and instead goes throughout your entire body the big mistake most guys make is they try to connect to their breath at the last minute right before ejaculation and oftentimes that is too late so connect to your breath early and be conscious of  your breath throughout the entire lovemaking experience and this will keep you in control number five start slow and standing up when you are ready to penetrate your partner make sure you are fully connected to your breath but also start slow and in the standing position so many guys make the mistake of just going right for it and pounding as deep and as fast as they can right away but I want you to be able to go in and then take it out slowly staying connected to your breath rub it on the outside go in  and take it out completely a few times before fully going in teasing her by starting slow but at the same time giving yourself the time and space to connect your breath and feel comfortable the standing position is also a great way to be grounded on the floor and be more in your body during sex a ton of men in my program have been able to last a lot longer in the standing position so give this a try next time you have sex and watch how much longer you last number six Express with sound connecting  to your breath is a huge key to this but being able to express with found on your exhale can be the Difference Maker to circulating and moving your sexual energy and allowing you to last as long as you want in the bedroom but the funny thing is this is something most men never do I used to be completely silent during sex and this can be awkward and put you in your head thinking like am I doing it right is it good enough for her should I be doing something else but if you are deeply connected to your  pleasure and breath and you're expressing them ah on the exhale you are so much more focused on the sensations in your body as opposed to being in your head and you see that's the key right there because when you are in your body that is when you'll be able to control how long you last in the bedroom and finally number seven is a rule that 99 of men get wrong and this is going to be the key to truly understanding how to last longer during sex with your partner and number seven is stay away from the  edge most men who already have an edging practice completely get this wrong that's because they think this edging practice automatically translate to sex with a partner and they try to get to the edge multiple times during sex and pull back the problem with this is if you go too close to the edge too soon you start to play with fire and sometimes there's no coming back and so instead of being in that heightened pleasure from being at the edge the rest of your experience is spent on trying to hold back your ejaculation and in a  fierce State as opposed to being calm and collected and in control don't get me wrong your edging practice is critical to learn your point of no return precisely but that's so you can stay at 60 to 70 percent to your Edge during sex with a partner what I want you to do is stay at that 60 to 70 percent of point of no return for a while until you build your confidence during sex and give her all the pleasure that she wants and needs and once she is satisfied and you are happy with how long you lasted and your control then  you can start to experiment with going closer to the edge of ejaculation but start conservatively and build that confidence and once you're out of your head and in your body and you stay at that 60 to 70 percent of that point of no return you will be able to last as long as you want and another important rule that is so important that I almost forgot is removing any expectations around sex with your partner if you can have that talk before the next time you have sex it doesn't matter if we have an  ejaculation or an orgasm or if I get hard or not or if you get wet let's just be intimate and connect and see what happens because when you take away the pressure and create safety just see what emerges and it often results in some of the best sexual experiences of your entire life now you know my seven tips and tricks and rules to live by so you can cure your premature ejaculation forever and hopefully tonight just from watching this video but if you are someone who is really struggling and has  been struggling for many years and is sick and tired and wants to fix this once and for all with mentorship and direct guidance click the link below in the description to get my free training on how you can last as long as you want in the bedroom and pleasure any woman in ways she'll never forget and book a call in directly with me I hope this video was

V53	https://youtu.be/SYKVsMMCOl4?si=DHGJ1jmgKr4qFea2	almost everyone at some point in their life will probably think about losing fat so how do we go from this potentially inches or centimeters thick of fat all the way down to this only a few millimeters thick well in today's video we're going to talk about what really happens when your body burns fat we'll look at the fat getting pulled from the fat cells and potentially burned in other areas of the body we'll also discuss some myths or ideas about can we control where we actually pull the fat from and we'll even talk about  is there a best type of exercise to lose fat it's going to be a squishy one so let's do this when most people talk about losing fat they're talking about losing subcutaneous fat sub just means below and cutaneous means skin so it'd be this fat right here directly below the skin and as you can see it can be up to inches thick and this fat would cover up the rectus abdominis right here that six-pack muscle here's another example of some fat that would cover up the deltoid muscle and so the idea is partly  Aesthetics people want to have their muscles shine through and so if the fat can be thinned out on top of the muscles then those muscles could more clearly shine through in all their striated Glory now even though it might be nice to have thinner subcutaneous fat so that you could see those muscles more clearly that doesn't mean we shouldn't mention visceral fat visceral means pertaining to internal organs so this would be the fat surrounding the organs here's the abdominal cavity up here's the thoracic  cavity where you'd find the heart and lungs now this particular body or this dissection is actually a little bit more tricky to make out specific structures and organs and that's because it has such a buildup of this visceral fat like look how thick and fatty this greater momentum is you can see these thicker fatty appendages coming off the intestine and that buildup of visceral fat in between what's even more remarkable is the amount of visceral fat around the heart yes the heart is inside here and it's crazy to think about  especially when you see what a normal amount of visceral fat around the heart looks like now the visceral fat inside here is sometimes also referred to as deep belly fat because as it builds up inside it can kind of push on your abdominal wall and increase your waist circumference and the more we learn about this visceral fat the more we understand it's links to certain health conditions things like metabolic syndrome type 2 diabetes high blood pressure and other cardiovascular conditions to name a few but the nice  thing about this visceral fat is we're going to actually lose it in a very similar way to how we'd actually lose the subcutaneous fat and with this discussion about losing or burning fat we're going to approach it from two different perspectives one is what can we just simply do to stimulate the fat loss and two this is kind of the more fascinating thing to me is if we actually look at what's going on within the adipose tissue when we burn through it and thin it out like where does it all go so let's focus on that part first  and then we'll talk about some strategies that we can do to stimulate the fat loss well to do this let's use an example like exercise of course let's say we're going to focus on the quad muscles those big muscles on the anterior thigh and those quad muscles are exercising and they need some extra energy and so we can pull from the fat stores to get this energy we could pull from the fat over the abdomen we could even pull from the fat that's around the shoulder here but if we were to zoom into this fatty tissue we would see that  it's primarily made up of these cells called adipocytes or adipose cells and probably not going to be too big of a shocker that these adipose cells store fat and the fat is stored as triglycerides that is a glycerol bonded to Three fatty acid chains and we actually need to break down these triglycerides before we can actually pull the fat out of the cells and circulate it throughout the body and there's an important enzyme inside of your adipose cells called hormone sensitive lipase and this hormone  sensitive lipase needs a little bit of help to get activated and when we're exercising we release certain chemicals like epinephrine and norepinephrine which you've maybe have heard of adrenaline or noradrenaline and also we release cortisol and all three of these can help to activate this hormone-sensitive lipase to start the process called lipolysis which is a fancy pants way of saying breaking down the fats and once we can break down these fats those fatty acids can be released into the bloodstream and as an  FYI these fatty acids don't like water kind of you know fat versus water they don't like each other so these fatty acids because our blood is primarily water need to be transported with a protein primarily this protein is albumin you can think of albumin as kind of like the taxi cab for your fatty acids and now once they're in the taxi cab they can circulate to the blood and onto our working quadriceps so now that we're in the bloodstream some of those fatty acids could make it into the femoral artery and take some of those  branches off of the femoral artery into the working quadriceps and once it's in the quadriceps those muscle fibers can take it in and funnel it into the mitochondria to make ATP so it's kind of cool to visualize that whole process of getting to the quadriceps but once we're in that mitochondria and making ATP those of you who've taken Biology before might remember that if we're doing this in the mitochondria making ATP with fatty acids this is going to be done aerobically meaning there is enough  oxygen present we only metabolize fats with oxygen aerobically whereas glucose or carbohydrates glucose can be metabolized anaerobically without oxygen but also with oxygen but to give you some numbers if we metabolize glucose with oxygen and funnel some of those products of glucose metabolism into the mitochondria we can get about 32 to 36 ATP from that glucose whereas the fatty acid like a common fatty acid that's metab palmitic acid that name is not really important so I don't know why I really mentioned it but that common  fatty acid can yield almost 113 atps so you might be thinking what's the catch why not just use fat for our energy all the time why would we ever use carbs well as we just learned there are some Logistics involved in utilizing fat for energy we have to pull it from the storage get it in the bloodstream and transport it to a muscle or potentially another cell that might utilize those fatty acids and they could be in a different body region altogether so there are multiple steps involved and there's this distance concern and yes  fats make a lot of ATP per molecule but it just takes more time and from an exercise perspective takes about 10 to 20 minutes to really ramp up your fat metabolism during exercise and our muscles can't actually store a lot of fat so again we're mostly relying on that fat storage if we're going to utilize fat for energy in the muscle tissue whereas our muscles are great at storing glucose in the form of glycogen glucose doesn't make as much ATP per molecule but it's right within the muscle ready and available and it's much  faster to actually metabolize it and break it down so bringing this full circle with what is actually happening inside our bodies when we lose fat as we consistently pull those fatty acids out of the adipose cells those cells will get smaller and smaller and smaller which will cause the overall tissue to get thinner and thinner contributing to that overall loss of body fat and of course making it easier to see those wonderful skeletal muscles now keep in mind we can apply these same principles that we've discussed to the visceral fat  we can pull fatty acids from the visceral fat which will reduce the overall amount within those body cavities and a question that people will often have with fat loss is can you control where you pull the fat from based on exercise choices like for example if you were to do a whole bunch of crunches to work out the rectus abdominis could you get your body to preferentially pull from the fat above the belly to make this muscle more visible and unfortunately there's no consistent evidence that I've ever seen  to support that it's not like you could go do all these glued exercises and clinch your butt cheeks all day long in between to try to tell your body hey just pull fat from around my glutes so you can see that a little bit better not really going to happen now that doesn't mean that you couldn't make a muscle be a little bit more visible by getting it bigger like for example if you did a whole bunch of crunches and these muscle fibers under hypertrophy or they just literally got bigger they might be a  little bit more visible just because the muscle was literally larger underneath but that wasn't because you told your body exactly where it could pull the fat from the key is consistent overall fat loss and the muscles will become more visible as body fat percentage continues to decrease and the last thing we need to discuss is this idea of a possible best type of exercise for burning fat does that actually exist like is there a true fat burning Zone that people should stay in if their main goal is Fat Loss  well it depends what you mean by a fat burning Zone yes there is a zone or level of exercise intensity where you burn a higher percentage or proportion of fats compared to carbohydrates and so you might initially think yes let's exercise in that zone if the goal is fat burning well proportions are one thing but we also have to look at the total overall number or amount of fat burned and let me give you an example to help illustrate this let's say we work in that fat burning Zone and burn a higher  proportion of fats compared to carbohydrates and we've earned a total of 100 calories during this light exercise session and 70 percent of those came from fats and only 30 percent came from carbs and since we're using nice round numbers that means 70 calories from fats 30 calories from carbohydrates and again you might think that's where we want to be well if we did another session on another day that was have higher intensity we would have to start shifting our utilization from fats to carbohydrates as intensity increases we  just don't have enough time to mobilize and utilize those fats so again we have to start shifting to carbohydrates but in that session we burn a total of 500 calories and 70 came from carbohydrates and only 30 percent from fat and so again you're right well I just burned less fat well no because 30 percent of 500 is 150 calories from fat whereas our previous example we only burned 70 calories now don't quote me on those exact numbers in those previous examples I was mostly using nice round numbers to  help illustrate the point but if you like some more details and Nitty Gritty numbers I actually made a chart in a previous video where I made exact calculations of the proportions of fats burned compared to carbohydrates in the fat burning Zone as well as that other exercise intensities so if you're interested in that I'll link that here but the last thing I want to mention about this idea of some perfect or best type of exercise for fat loss is if we were to look at multiple different types of athletes looking at like Runners and  cyclists basketball players soccer players tennis players weight lifters and even like a wide receiver in football because yes there are certain positions in football and other sports where some extra fat or weight might be beneficial but for the most part if we looked at these different types of athletes yes we would see some differences in muscular development certain Sports and training modalities would stimulate more like muscular endurance type adaptations and the muscles wouldn't get very large where  other types of sports and training the muscles would get stimulated to increase in size and everywhere in between so I would see that difference in muscular development but one thing that these athletes would share in common is that they don't carry a lot of extra fat around so what we can glean from this is that there is not one best way to do this there are multiple ways to be successful in burning and losing fat and so one of the beautiful things that I think is about exercise is the amount of choices that we have and  we are more likely to consistently participate in exercise and therefore have successful fat loss if we do exercise that we actually like doing and enjoy so if you are the ones that like to do long distance running you could lose fat doing that if you like higher intensity training and intervals you could lose weight and fat doing that if you like weight training or a combination of weight training and cardio you can be successful and obviously participating in your sports could help with this what most of the  data is suggesting is that it's not about focusing so much on this proportion of how much fat compared to carbs I burned it's still more about the overall caloric expenditure and yes losing weight and fat is easier said than done in certain situations there are things we can't control like genetics age even hormones and other things but I always say to patients let's do try to focus on what we can control and we can control how many calories we burn and how many calories we bring in so if we can be successful  at Burning more calories than we bring in or ingest then we can have some potential success in losing fat and losing weight and then once we get to a place where we're happy with then we can adjust and those inputs can equal outputs so hopefully you learn something new and useful about how the body burns fat and although we typically think about how we can get rid of fat sometimes I think it might be beneficial for us to metaphorically fatten up our brains with brilliant brilliant.org is an

Y53	https://youtu.be/aEt9bLN3R2s?si=TQKaDpM-Ig5vCwc1	do you have a weak flat butt I want to turn it into a strong rounded set of glutes today I'm bringing in red Contreras the man has dedicated his life to studying and transforming people's glutes and five easy steps will help you build a 12-week workout plan designed to grow your glutes as fast as scientifically possible the first step is to figure out how often to train your glutes and with how much volume the glutes are a huge muscle they have multiple subdivisions they carry out several distinct muscle actions and they  can handle a lot of volume and frequency as long as you incorporate variety now the most common training split we use to accomplish this is a lower upper lower upper lower so we're going to train them three times per week to maximize our rate of glute growth so that's three lower body days with two upper body days sandwiched between them but you can tweak this depending on how many days you have available to work out as for how many sets to do Brett recommends 36 sets of glutes per week at first I was  pretty shocked 36 sets per week week you can recover from it it's not too much of most males in the industry would say oh that's Overkill according to the published research we should only be doing 20 or you know you should be doing 36 sets but I'm telling you the glutes can handle it I'm telling you how my top responders they're all doing it all the top bikini Pros they're all training glutes three times a week they wouldn't be doing this if it wasn't effective they figure out the best way they're  obsessed they care more about glute training than we do about pecs or biceps you know but you can't just do 36 sets of really exhausting exercises like squats and deadlifts Brett explained the key is to split up the 36 sets a week into three different types of exercises 12 cents should come from what's known as a vertical hip extension exercises where the body is positioned vertically in relation to the resistance although we don't really know why both Brett and I have tested this with EMG and found  they activated more of the lower glutes it's also the most taxing category of exercises since the they heavily involve the quads and hamstrings this is why 12 sets should also come from horizontal hip extension exercises where the body's positioned horizontally relative to the resistance these are a bit less fatiguing and will Target both the upper and lower glutes and the remaining 12 sets should come from abduction exercises where the legs move out to the side these are the least tax in but they  help build up the upper glutes and the glute medius as for the best exercises to use for each of these categories and how to perform them for the most glute growth let's start with vertical hip extension so the first exercise is the back squat use whatever stance width and foot angle is most comfortable for you and try to descend as low as possible without too much butt week for Max glue growth you'll want to try to get down to at least parallel slightly below and focus on pushing through the heels on  the way up dumbbell Bulgarian split sweats will complement squats very well but to better Target the glutes you'll want to lean your torso forward and descend diagonally at a slight angle backwards on the way down once your back knee almost touches the ground push up through the heel of your front foot and drive your hips forward another great exercise my clients have had success with is the Smith machine reverse lunge the added stability helps them really focus on their glutes here we position  the feet so that at the bottom the knee is in line with the foot we also use a slight lean at the Torso to better Target the glutes and don't be afraid to go heavy my top girls they're using two plates per side last but not least we have the Romanian devil so you can do these with dumbbells or with the barbell but the key to targeting the glutes is to keep your shins vertical sit back as far as possible and let your knees Bend come down to just below your kneecaps and then use your glutes to thrust your  hips forward for this category I'd use a lower rep range of around 6 to 12 reps per set that usually works best so you want to add two to three of these exercises into your weekly glute routine we'll do this for you at the end of the video but to grow your upper glutes and also challenge your glutes in a different way you'll want to some of the exercises from the next category as well horizontal hip extension one of my favorite exercises for this category is hip thrust they do a great job of activating all the glutes especially the  upper area but it's important that you do them right keep your mid back on a bench or pad push up through your heels to drive your hips as high as possible now at this point your shins should be vertical if they're not shift your feet further in or out and hold that top position for three seconds before coming back down now I also like exercise that work the glutes one at a time and this next one is a great option especially if you don't have access to weight you can do these off of a couch here you spread  your arms across the bench in a T formation and Center both feet so that they're touching then come up to the top of the hip thrust and lift one leg off the ground while keeping the knee bent lower yourself down and push through the heel of the grounded leg to push your hips as high as possible but also a single lay of just the 3x20 protocol became popular and it's hard for everyone like I don't care who you are at least let's say 20 with really smooth form is brutal yeah and and you know especially as you get good you can  reduce the rest time so if you do three by Twenty with a minute rest between sets ugh the third set at 20 reps your glutes are burning real good this next one works the glutes a little differently than hip thrust here you'll need a back extension machine set it up so that the pad is just on your hips now to better Target the glutes flare your feet out to 45 degrees and round your upper back keep your upper back rounded and raise your body up by pushing your hips into the pad using your glutes if  you don't have access to this one you can do the reverse hip extension exercise that Jeremy and I covered in our past video together so we're going to go a little bit higher Reps for this category usually a moderate rep range of around 8 to 20 reps per set works best all right so before we get to building your glute workouts we need to cover the last category of exercises hip abduction Brett explained how most people Overlook the effectiveness of these exercises because they aren't big and heavy  movements yet he's found that when his clients do this properly and consistently only and really push hard during them they see massive growth especially in the glute medius an important muscle not just for looks but for function and knee and hip Health as well here are his top picks most girls love this machine but guys don't be embarrassed to hop on here it's extremely effective for glue growth now I likely to recommend leaning forward and holding on to the support drive your knees out as far as you can then control  the weight back until your knees almost touch together if you don't have a machine you can replace these with band seated hip abductions or the next exercise which is body weight now for an exercise that doesn't involve any equipment this one is a great option get into a side plank position with your knees bent at around a 90 degree angle drive up through the grounded knee while driving your hips forward and separating your knees as much as you can let the hips move back on the way down you should feel both sides of your glutes  working this is actually an advanced exercise though so take your time and only do as many reps as you can with good form even for someone like myself who's been training glutes for many many years I only do three sets of 12 with body weight and it's very challenging still last but not least if you have cables make sure you include this one stand sideways to a cable machine and use a strap to attach the foot of your far leg to the cable hold on to the column with your opposite arm take a few steps sideways until there's tension in  the cable and then move your planted leg in front of your working leg with your foot slightly turned in from here swing the leg outward as far as you can to your side without rotating your foot outward don't lean forward as you do this and keep your core braced strongly you can also try swinging your foot in front of your planted leg instead of behind of your planted leg and see if that feels better I'd say fifty percent of my clients like their leg out in front fifty percent like it behind now  for this category I recommend a higher rep range of around 12 to 30 reps per set that's what works best so you've got the workout split you've got the exercises but now you need the actual workouts this step is the most important you need to build your glue workouts in a way that doesn't create excessive soreness throughout your week yet also challenges your glutes in different ways here are three sample glute workouts you can get started with that do just that but Brett and I have also created a free  12 week workout routine that will guide you week by week with all of your workouts you can download this over at builtwithscience.com group plan give this video a watch next if you need some help activating the glutes big thanks to Brett for his help with this video the man is truly a master of his craft and I'll leave links below to his website and social media and I'll see you next time

V55	https://youtu.be/s1j1gnEuDkU?si=6nRft2vZkzUNYdwJ	but this is crazy bro like how did you guys survive the danger Gen X phas the title is danger so we're going to be seeing what kind of dangers they was facing that we probably didn't have to face so yeah before we do jump this I appreciate you guys can H that subscribe button I also do have a patreon if you guys do want to help support further link is in the description yeah let's jump into this and check this out if you grew up as Generation X then it's probably a miracle you even survived at least that's what the modern world tells  us okay many of the things that were normal back then are now taboo right in this video we will have a look back and wonder how Gen X kids even survived yeah okay so is directly aimed at like Gen X kids then so when you was a kid joing listen if you're a Gen X you going have to tell me is this true and just tell me like how did you survive the things it's going to come up television wasn't everything but it was still pretty important right if you were a kid in the 70s then you probably did not even have cable uh most people  relied on a television antenna which was usually rabbit ears and tin foil however there were some households that used an antenna that was mounted on top of the roof you did you say roof mount top of the roof um we actually still have some of these on UK homes every so often this antenna would need to be adjusted thanks to some wind or weather yo true this became a family affair dad of course was in charge of the picture so he was right in front of the television one of the kids would be up on top of the roof and ready to receive  instructions from the relay of the rest of the family spread out from Dad wait wait he just said kid wait wait is is that true so dad will be in front of the TV trying to get the picture and you send the kid on the roof to fix it yo what no one ever thought anything about kids being on the roof and then falling off most kids got up there anyways just to get a better view of the neighborhood or the Stars okay many newer roofs are much more Steep and that might be considered child abuse to send your kid up there I guess  it's a good thing that people don't have to deal with antennas on the roof Summers as a kid were always fun yo is that true I need to know if you're jet X did you ever go to the roof and fix the antenna and yo that's crazy bro I can't imagine being s up there that's actually crazy the roof Summers as a kid were always fun and why wouldn't it be okay you were out of school and that meant you could spend more time with your friends you outside with all that running around outside you were bound to get thirsty right there's  nothing quicker and more refreshing than a sip from the garden hose of course you had to let it run a while before it got cool enough to drink but it certainly had a distinctive taste wait no no no no no was what going on what's going on what's going on what's going on is this true you get you get Generation X kids were drinking from the garden H is that is that true wait what when is the last time that you've seen a kid do this it's supposed to be unhealthy yet here we are but occasionally I still  take a sip from the garden hose what the garden hose was also connected to a couple other activities that parents today may consider them to be too dangerous okay like what the first one was the slip and slide sounds good the older additions of the slip and slide were a little bit more dangerous and some kids broke bones or chipped teeth on these but just about everyone slid off the end or over the side and got a grass or Rock burn wow believe it or not they still sell these but they are a little bit safer oh is this the  slipp inside oh I bet I was hella fun I you know what I bet I bet you had so much fun growing up like yeah you might have got a few knocks few broken bones maybe you saw tummy with the with the guarded H but it seems like you're having a great time this next item however I'm not so sure about as kids we all enjoyed playing in the water sprinkler but some of these sprinklers could be pretty rough this one in particular was really dangerous it had a solid steel base that could certainly hurt if you stubbed a toe on it or fell  on it but that wasn't the dangerous part when the water ran through the sprinkler it would move the metal fan blade at the top at that point it was like a little saw blade that was spinning fast on top and it could cut through little water soaked toes and feet kids were fast Learners though if they got cut once they would be sure to clear it the next time oh kids in our day used to be outside a lot and we I love this game I actually love this game when you get like a bat and you smack it around and it com back  yeah I love that game that game was so fun he loved it that worked out great kids in our day used to be outside a lot and yo end the sentence here bro kids generation as kids used to be outside a lot boom end it kids nowadays bro we we just play video games man we loved it that worked out great because most of our parents really didn't want us inside the house anyways as a result kids spend a lot of time out in the sun and sun do you know what I actually miss and I'm actually glad that like I experience a little bit  so when I was a kid right I'm 27 so when I was a kid um I was kind of like in the between of like still going outside but technology was like getting more and more and more popular right so I never we we didn't really have phones but phones would started to be introduced but there was a few years where I actually experienced like knocking on for your friends do you know what I'm saying bro these kids nowadays they don't know what that is bro knocking off for your friends and then being told by the mom like he's not in's sick y I  remember when my friends would be at my door and I'd be like I'd be like M tell him I'm Ill tell him I'm Ill cuz I didn't want to go out but yeah that that was thinking back on it that was so fun that was actually so fun now nowadays you just like text and you see but yeah it was fun growing up I was like in kind of like the middle of it transforming to technology being really like really popular cuz when I was like 15 that's when I stopped going outside completely but Jed X-Man I bet you guys had a lot  of fun growing up we had no idea what that was are you talking about a hat or a shade tree what was that as a result kids spend a lot of time out in the sun and sun block we had no idea what that was are you talking about a hat or a shade tree at most we may have depended on spf4 and that's only if we were super cautious everyone was exposed to the Sun and many of us would compare sunburn burs at the end of the day when our skin started peeling we would see who could peel off the biggest flake oh look that  one looks like Texas it also wasn't uncommon to see teen girls and young women laying out and trying to get that Golden Beach Tan quite often they would speed up this process by using either coconut oil or tanning oil wait so you had coconut oil tanning oil to like get more of a time but you didn't really have like sunblock today most kids get lathered up with anything from 30 SPF to 100 SPF I get our protection parents in those days certainly didn't have to watch us like the parents do today they  not only trusted us but they also trusted our friends and the rest of the community right parents realized that we needed to do things on our own and that was how we were going to learn however if they were watching and we happened to get hurt there was no doubt that they were going to be laughing as long as it wasn't life-threatening yo nowadays they be super worried bro bikes were everything to a Gen X kid and they provided us a freedom that we couldn't get from anything else we could go on adventures  that were hours away from home and for the most part our parents had no idea where we were at yo we also used our bikes to jump some pretty shady ramps we could do a lot with some plywood and bricks and it was hours of entertainment as we look back on our childhoods and compare it to Modern kids it's hard to believe that we did all those bike adventures with no helmet or knee pads M this picture pretty well bro okay okay okay you did this you did this how many people in the comments have done this bro I highly doubt this  is popular this is just crazy this is crazy sums up the generation this kid is jumping his bike off of a super tall ramp notice that he has no helmet knee pads or elbow pads this is crazy pure fun adventure the man's in the bat just watching this like damn these kids are mental man if this evil Canal lands short then the kid on the end is in trouble and occasionally that did happen as you look at the kids on the side you can tell that they are worried about this because they've seen it happen themselves but the best part  about this photo is there's a dad sitting on the front steps and he's smoking a cigarette while he's waiting to see who gets hurt first for him this is as good as Kong show on television back in those days cigarette smoke was everywhere bro that's too funny but wait this was actually a thing bro like that was actually a thing couldn't avoid secondhand smoke if you wanted to in fact most of us had at least one parent that smoked right parents would send their kids into convenience stores to purchas cigarettes  while they waited out in the car Wait the kids huh kids most of us had at least one parent that smoked parents would send their kids into convenience stores to purchase cigarettes while they waited out in the car well kids could buy the C us the clerk would just look out and get a nod from the parent which would signal that it was okay to buy the cigarettes what if the parents were not around then the kid probably needed a note from the parents saying that it was okay to buy the cigarettes a note bro a  note you could just write the note yourself these notes were never all that offici sure in it please let my daughter Stacy purchase a pack of guess that's said cigarettes bro what might be written on a notepad scratch of paper or the back of a receipt dear clerk please sell Rett a carton of cigarettes thanks Mom can you believe that actually worked there's no chance that kids could ever do that today yeah no way car safety was something else that most people didn't take too seriously okay in the US it became mandatory that  every car manufactured after 1968 had to have seat belts installed in them what did they have seat belts but wearing them was more of a recommendation rather than a requirement until the mid 1980s oh this is mad bro this is mad J X what the hell yo yo yo yo yo yo yo yo yo like like bro we we we just pass halfway and watching this I'm thinking like how on Earth are we like terrify had to do things when we was kids or like the kids now when you not survive doing this like what until then we stood up on the front  seat so that we could see up over the dash and our dad's arm was our seat belt and the airbag another thing that we would do is lay up on the back dash and pick our noses as we looked at the cop car behind us what we thought it was super fun when dad had a slam on the brakes and we came flying out of that back window and slammed into the back of the front seat back then we had to learn how to take a fall and the crazy thing about it is we couldn't wait to get back up there and try it again what yo I could imagine  being a kid that would be super fun but this is this is crazy bro pickup trucks were not as common as what you see today people that had boats would haul them with regular cars even Cadillacs and when dad needed Lumber it was going on the roof of the car so that it could come home right he would tie it down a little but it was still our job to help hold the lumber down as it was stacked on the roof how so there we were standing up on the seat halfway out the window clinging to the lumber on top  while Dad had his hand on our waistband to keep us from falling out somehow his other hand was busy holding down the lumber on his side which is pretty incredible to think about how is he driving at the same time he was also steering the car shifting gears and smoking a cig cigarette wait you telling me in J X the parents had like eight arms what what is going on man it's no wonder that we thought he could do anything how remember some of the other activities we did we all had toys that are considered dangerous now but back  then it was completely normal yes how many toys darts was one of those toys then it was completely normal lawn darts was one of those toys that waited sharp Point could penetrate anything if you didn't get the heck out of the way clackers Click Clacks or knockers had the possibility of shattering and sending shards of plastic flying through the air like shrapnel what yet somehow some of these clackers survived in fact here is my pair from the '70s no way back then we learned how to entertain ourselves with the simplest of  things what done remember making long chains from soda and beer can pull t according to what they say today we could have been badly cut at any moment yet most of us had minor Cuts if any but yo was you guys just built different in Gen X like did you have like thicker skin like bro this is mod one dangerous activity that we all did was kite fighting remember this one what kite fighting you would fasten razor blades to the side of your kite and then swoop it down so that you could cut the string of your  friend's kite that's if you were successful then that kite would keep flying forever but if your kite took a nose dive to the ground then you better be quick and get out of the way of those razor blades BB guns were another item that was quite common okay yeah I had a few BB guns I did I see as I haven't done much of this bro this video has gone crazy right but BB Goods I had BB Goods kids could go all over town with one on the front of their handlebars and the BB wars would certainly get intense  back then we definitely did not have safety at the top of our list when those broke out yo I remember bro I had like a BB gum fight on the street I was only a kid I was only young we had a BB gun fight and I AC I went to shoot my friend and I accidentally shot like a girl walking by another kid right she was like far away but the bullet hit her and she ran off crying and then her like I'm only small her big like 6' five dad came around the corner came up to me snaap my gun yo I was so scared bro I was so scared  firecrackers were certainly a lot more accessible than they are today it seemed like you could pop them off in every city and it was perfectly legal did you ever set off some fireworks and then place them into your Tonka truck and roll it into the driveway where some neighborhood girls were playing Jack so that you could get their attention what no well I guess that was just me then what speaking of jacks they were definitely something painful to step on if you were Barefoot any parent today that complains about a Lego being  stepped on has probably never really stepped on a Jacks what these things would completely hide in the shag carpet and they were like little soldiers that were waiting to Ambush you this is M with all that time that you spin on the bicycle then I'm sure that you probably came in contact with at least one of these okay yeah I've had this before the metal pedal things and like sometimes it would just flick straight into your ankle oh one slip of the foot and this pedal could travel up your leg like a  vegetable pillar kids today know nothing about that level of pain here is something else that could be really painful these chairs were really comfortable to lay in but when you got up you had lines going all across your skin how comes but that wasn't the wor worst part cuz of the stripes they were not the easiest to adjust you had to bend them all the way in so that you could adjust them further out huh one wrong move in the hinges of these torture devices could snap down on you like a bear trap and take off a  chunk of skin Oh are these chairs even sold today oh what despite all the dangers that were lurking all around us it really was a special time to grow up in I can imagine were friendly and neighbors were someone that you could count on some of the dangers that we see today are completely different than what we faced yo Generation X people right they must think that the the kids and the the people below them uh the generation like whatever below them are just wimps bro are just wimps cuz this is ment like  yeah don't give me rock it seemed like you had a lot of fun but this is crazy bro like how did you guys survive do you have any special memories that you would like to share that's mad if you are Gen X you guys got to let me know what it was like for you in the comment section really interest to check it out you guys definitely seem to have a fun time but a very very dangerous time but yeah that was crazy bro I was expecting that at all really fun video hopefully you guys enjoyed if you did make give a thumbs up  subscribe for more content I'm live every single day on twitch.tv/ l3w if you guys

G60	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpV47rUYk8I&t=16s	Let's talk about Zettelkasten. This is the  efficient note-taking system that is going to help any knowledge worker out there leverage what they  already know and learn new information, and be able to see the connection between the two. Hi, everyone, it's Vicky. Welcome back to my channel. If you're new here, I talk about  mental models and frameworks for clear thinking and clear communications. So let's go  into what is Zettelkasten, how do we use it, and what benefits you'll get out of this! What is Zettelkasten?  First, Zettelkasten means slip box in German.  Zettel is slip, which usually refers to a slip of paper or index card, and Kasten means crate, which  is like a box that you put the index cards in. Niklas Luhmann, a German sociologist, used this  unique note-taking system in order to track all his research and to be able to produce 70 books  and hundreds of articles in just 30 plus years. That's an average of more than two books a  year, as well as all the academic articles. So how did he do this? It's with the Zettelkasten  method, and the method is very simple. All you  need are 3 things: you need a Zettel, which  is the pieces of paper. You need Kasten, which is the box or the crate, and then you  just need a pen. Of course, this is the analog version of Zettelkasten, and I'll share with  you the digital version of it as well. But let's start from the basics of how Luhmann did it. 3 Types of Zettel (notes) There are three types of Zettel, three  types of notes. They are fleeting notes, literature notes, and permanent notes. First, fleeting notes. These are the thoughts that  come through our head as we go on our daily lives,  whether it's shower thoughts, thoughts that you have when you're taking a long walk, when you're  talking to friends and all of a sudden you have an epiphany. These are thoughts that disappear  very quickly, so we must capture them first. The second type of notes are literature  notes. This is what we write down when we are consuming content, whether it's reading  a book or an article, listening to a podcast, watching a YouTube video, watching a movie,  listening to songs, it doesn't matter what it  is. When you're consuming content, you want to  write down literature notes, and these capture: 1. one atomic idea each. So it has to be  brief, no more than three to five sentences. 2. It also has to be re-described in your own  words so that you internalize what is being said. 3. You also want to be able to note down the  references so you know exactly where it came from, and you can always go back to reference it. So now we have fleeting notes from everyday life. We have literature notes from when  we consume content and when we are learning.  Then the third type of notes are permanent  notes. We create permanent notes by reviewing what we have written in fleeting notes and in our  literature notes. So the input is the literature notes and the fleeting thoughts they've  had, and the output is the permanent note. As researcher Sankar Ahrens says, the productivity  of a knowledge worker should be tracked by how many permanent notes you produce a day and  the rules for writing a permanent note are: 1. One atomic idea per note. 2. Express the idea clearly,  assuming the reader does not have context. 3. Connect them with the other notes in your system. The rationale behind these rules is simple. First, you want one idea  per note because these are building blocks. Each note is a building block where you can  rearrange and connect with new ideas, old ideas, things that seemingly are not connected. So  you want to be able to remove complexity and be able to rearrange these ideas. Then you want to  assume that the reader doesn't have any context, and this is because you are trying to make the  system future-proof. I'm sure this has happened to  so many of us where in the moment we jot something  down thinking, I know exactly what I'm saying, and the next day you go back to this  note and you have no idea what you wrote. So to avoid that and to be able to articulate  your ideas properly, we want to make sure that it is expressed clearly without needing a lot of  context. So that not only your current self can use this, future self can use this as well.  And then, we want to connect them within the system. And this is really where the crux of the  Zettelkasten method comes in. The connections is  what makes your knowledge usable. I'm  sure most of us have this experience in school where we have all these isolated  ideas that we've memorized, but we don't know how to use them We don't know how to piece  them together. What is the bigger picture here? And so the Zettelkasten method, it really is  to help you think about the big picture and to see the interconnections between different  ideas and how they may relate to each other. Setting up Kasten (boxes) Which brings us to the next point of how to set up the boxes. The Kasten of  the Zettelkasten. The way Luhmann set this up  was using only two boxes or two kastens. The first  one is reference, which had all of his literature notes categorized by a unique ID, and the other  box is ideas, which stored all the permanent notes that were based on the literature notes, as well  as fleeting notes. Now, the fleeting notes weren't actually categorized. Instead, what you would  do is review it on a regular basis with the literature notes and then, if appropriate,  he would elevate it to a permanent note. Why Zettelkasten? The most important aspect of Zettelkasten is that  it is not a top-down organizing system. So what  I mean by that is, we don't create folders named psychology, sociology, math, science, and then  we try to slot our notes into the categories. We're not trying to force our ideas into a folder.  Instead, it's a bottom-up approach where we have all the notes and we keep them there. And over  time, we try to see what comes out of these notes, elevating our original ideas into permanent  notes, which dictate what topic they are, what the ideas are about. This way, you can  have more of a multidisciplinary approach.  You can see connections, intersections between  ideas without abstractly limiting yourself by putting things into folders. I'm a huge proponent  of intersectional thinking - this idea that the connection between ideas, the intersection,  is where creativity happens is where innovation happens. It's where we realize how the world  actually works. And that's why Zettelkasten for me is a really important system. Customizing your Zettelkasten Now, I want to caveat by saying that the way  Luhmann set up his Zettelkasten might not  make sense to you per se. Depending on how you  think, you might need to tweak things a little bit. For example, with the boxes, some people  actually prefer to just have one box to put all ideas in: fleeting notes, literature notes, and  permanent notes all into one place, and because they are digitized it, it is easier for them  to go in and search for things. For others, it might be chronological. That they think in  time. So they think, OK, last week I had this idea and I think it connects to my idea now. And so  instead, they would organize things by time. Or  if you're a spatial thinker, I am one of those,  I need to think about things in, OK, this is the fleeting note box. This is the literature box. And  this is my ideas box. And to be able to know which idea belongs where, and I know exactly how to  retrieve them and how to connect them together. So there's a lot of flexibility in Luhmann's system  because it is so simple. If you're interested, I walk through my setup of Zettelkasten in Obsidian.  I actually write a lot of my notes by hand, so I'll also show you how you can digitize your notes  so you can still have everything in one place and  also how to sync it between different devices.  Because as I've talked about, fleeting notes are the ones that you need to capture immediately. And  sometimes all you have is your phone, but you do most of your note-taking on your computer.  So how do you sync things between devices? I'll cover all of that in this video here. Let me know in the comments if you're currently using Zettelkasten, or if you're getting into  it now, or if you're still on the fence. Because ever since I started this, my creativity has  increased, my productivity has increased. It's  so much easier for me to write my newsletter on  intersectional thinking, so much easier to produce YouTube content. I have a huge list of  things I want to write about, talk about, and the best part is that you can start anywhere  and over time you have that satisfaction of seeing ideas emerge, especially if you're using Obsidian  like I am, in the graph. It will visually show you what the connections are and that is so powerful.  Not something that my measly mind can come up with by itself. So if you're not building a  second brain, you should really consider it.  And with that, if you found this video helpful,  please give it a thumbs up. Subscribe if you haven't already. I'll talk about more of how  to create your personal knowledge management system in the future videos. So stay tuned for  that and I'll see you in the next video. Bye! 
Y60	            https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osUkXumb2N0&t=29s	i'm going to show you a series of images see if you notice anything strange [Music] did you notice anything did you see any faces did some of those images even seem to convey some kind of specific emotion if so you're not alone this is an extremely pervasive aspect of how we perceive and it even has a name it's called pareidolia we are hardwired to see human faces everywhere in an electrical socket in a random outcropping of rocks on mars we see faces everywhere today we're going to talk about visual  object recognition and mental imagery how do we break down and recognize what we're seeing what kinds of operations do we perform on imagistic mental representations how do we use visual information to construct an image of the world around us [Music] [Applause] let's start by talking about object recognition how do we actually recognize objects this is a pretty important part of how we navigate the world i need to be able to look at objects and be able to tell if something is food or not food that's  probably the most basic and most important function that i have as an organism navigating my daily life it's important for me to know whether i'm about to pick up a permanent marker or a dry erase marker how many white boards have been ruined so how do we actually recognize objects what are the steps we take to determine what an object is what kind of mental representations do we generate and how do we manipulate those representations well we're going to need some kind of model for visual object recognition  we're going to talk about representations what's the form of the representation that we generate when we're trying to recognize an object and we're going to talk about operations because remember what are computations if not operations performed over representations so we're going to compare different sorts of algorithms for a very specific type of information processing task the goal of object recognition so here we're going to stay above the implementational level we're going to focus on representations and processes  so we're going to stay right at that algorithmic level to talk about how we represent the information we get through our eyes and how we use that to recognize objects in the outside world one model that can explain how we recognize objects is called template matching template matching says that we recognize objects by comparing visual input some kind of visual image to a template formed by past experience which also takes the form of a mental image so the representational type here is imagistic it's an imagistic  representation and the operation that we're performing to recognize the object is some kind of direct comparison maybe even just overlaying the image of what we're seeing now with the image from our memory the goal here is to take an input and then classify it does it fall into a category that i already have stored in memory so if i see an animal on my balcony i want to know is that a bird is it a cardinal i'm very interested in seeing cardinals i like cardinals a lot so i might take the image of what i'm seeing now and i'll  take whatever examples of cardinals i've seen in the past and i'll compare them directly and see how closely does this match what i'm seeing right now i think this is kind of an intuitively appealing sort of model taking what we know what we've experienced in the past and comparing it very directly to what we're experiencing now so the way template matching works there's a stimulus in the world that generates a mental image we take that input through our eyes transduce it and then use that to generate an  imagistic mental representation take that mental image and compare that to previous mental images from previous encounters we've had with similar objects and it's the direct comparison between those two mental images those two imagistic representations they can tell us whether what we're seeing matches what we've seen before or whether it's something novel now there are some issues here what if we're seeing a new object from a unique angle what if i've never seen it from this angle before does it have to match perfectly in order  for me to recognize it what if it has a different shape or size or color there's a lot of variation in the world there may be too much variation in the input there may be too many variants of any given particular object for me to do a conclusive match think of recognizing a letter like the letter a well letter a could be in any font any of hundreds of different kinds of fonts different font sizes it can be printed in different media it could be on a wood block it could be printed on a page in a book it could be  digital on a screen and each of those is going to look slightly different and that's a very limited case real objects in the real world like trees or animals or people we are extremely very there's a high degree of variance between all of these things and not just from one individual to another but from one viewing angle to another so we'd have to somehow account for all of that variation when we were doing this matching process and it's not clear how effective that would be let's consider another model called  recognition by components this is a model that was endorsed by david maher you may remember from the levels of analysis he was a vision neuroscientist so he was very interested in how we recognize objects the recognition by components theory says that when we view an object we first break it down into 3d features to create a visual model so the representation is not just a visual image it is a visual image but it's a visual image an imagistic representation with very specific properties it's actually a  three-dimensional visual model so this is like the difference between your computer showing you a jpeg an image of something versus rendering a three-dimensional model of something like for a pixar movie so even though we're going to build a three-dimensional model the input that we receive is still two-dimensional light hits our retina and that gets transduced into an electrical signal that gets turned into an image but the image that we're getting on the backs of our retinas is a two-dimensional image  it's a two-dimensional image of a three-dimensional object in the world so somehow we're going to have to bridge that gap from two-dimensional image projected onto our retinas to some kind of three-dimensional visual representation in our minds but it makes a lot of sense if we can do this because what we really want is to be able to reconstruct what the object was in the world that caused that two-dimensional image to hit our retinas and the im the thing in the world that's causing our perceptual event is a  three-dimensional thing so it makes sense that we would want to recreate a three-dimensional model of that thing in our minds so there's gonna have to be some series of operations here that can reconstruct a three-dimensional model from that two-dimensional input and the way this is going to work is we're going to dissect the image into atomic units called geons and assemble those into a three-dimensional figure so these geons these are the primitive units of three-dimensional shapes they have 3d features they take forms of  things like cubes and cylinders pyramids and spheres and we take those and we use those to reconstruct a model not necessarily strictly an image but a model that corresponds to the image that we are seeing it's sort of like those drawing guides you may have seen when you were younger how do you draw this character you draw a big circle for the body in a circle for the head and you draw tubes for arms and whatnot and then it's some point you can transform that into a more detailed and accurate drawing  but it gives you the basic structure to use these atomic units there are several advantages of this model one is view invariants geons are recognizable from any viewing angle so once you have managed to construct a three-dimensional model you can rotate it in your mind's eye and reposition it to see if it matches whatever you're seeing now it's also resistant to visual noise there's a certain amount of top-down processing involved here we are reconstructing a three-dimensional model of a thing in the world and so we're not  so reliant on all of the details of the thing we are seeing what's more important is the three-dimensional space that it inhabits the way those three-dimensional geons come together and integrate with each other one of the pieces of evidence that this is in fact how we process images comes from experiments like this this is a series of images on the left we have the raw images themselves these very simple line drawings of 3d objects and then on the right we have the same images but with some of the information  removed so that our brains will have to fill in that missing information we'll have to do some top-down processing but not all of these images are equally easy to reconstruct do you get the sense that the images in the b column are a little bit easier to figure out how they map to those original images than the images in the c column the c column images seem more ambiguous it's harder to tell what they're supposed to be they're harder to reconstruct why is that the question that we should ask is what  is being removed here and what is being preserved in the b image we have lines and importantly we have junctures that more closely correspond to geons these are at the intersections of the edges they are where the edges meet each other so together they can help us project the entire 3d shape or fill it in it's really important and meaningful to have those points of intersection that can tell us what kind of 3d shape we should be reconstructing in the c image we don't have those intersection points  so we can't easily reconstruct the geons that the image is made of the line segments don't help us project a 3d shape that's at least one way of explaining why this task becomes easier when certain pieces of information are removed and not others it could be because we are reconstructing it into some kind of atomic rudimentary geons 3d shapes to build that three-dimensional model i have one more model that i wanted to share called feature integration and feature integration is more about attention than about  object recognition per se here we'll concentrate not just on recognizing a single shape as belonging to some category in isolation but among other shapes essentially how do we recognize objects in noise when there are other objects that will distract you so this is all about attention how do we direct our attention to solve the problem of recognizing an object when there are a lot of distractors and feature integration is all about feature extraction and recombination so instead of trying to match to a  template and instead of trying to deconstruct into three-dimensional geons what we're going to do is we're going to break an image down into its visual features and then we're going to perform a series of operations where we identify those features and then re-integrate them back together so there are three stages to this there's a pre-attentive stage which is fast and automatic and effortless where we can identify a single salient feature so if there is a single feature among all those competing objects  we will be able to identify that very quickly very effortlessly very automatically does not require any directed attention in the second stage that's where we have to use our focused attention this is a lot slower it's more effortful it requires directed attention and this is where we're going to identify other important features and then integrate those features together into a visual representation that can help us recognize the object that we are looking for and then stage three is object recognition this is when we have reached  our goal we can recognize the object so this model of feature integration it is a model about object recognition but it's also a model about how we find objects we can think of this as sort of solving the where's waldo problem how do we find waldo in these chaotic scenes full of distracting information well if he was different enough from everything else in the scene we would be able to pull him out by identifying a single feature that contrasts with all of the other objects in that scene and we would be able to do  so in a way that would be very fast and automatic it's the fact that waldo actually shares so many features with so many other things in the scene that causes this to be such a slow and deliberate process that's what induces the challenge of where's waldo we can't immediately spot waldo because he shares too many features with too many other things in the scene let's play a little game to see this in action what i want you to do is i want you to find the red tea and pay attention to how hard it seems  to find the red tea among all of these red s's okay that was not so bad pretty easy what about now i've added several more s's has it gotten more difficult or does it still feel pretty easy okay what about now [Music] what did i change there are still s's and t's but now they're not all red anymore they're mixed too so did this get a little bit harder probably now instead of being able to identify that single salient feature now there are two features you have to keep track of whether something is an s or a t the  shape but also the color so we don't get that pop out effect we can't immediately see the t it takes a little more effort did it get a little bit harder again by adding more and more t's and s's it gets harder and harder now that there is more than one feature that we have to pay attention to so these experiments imply that when we scan objects we have to perform operations for each unique feature for the shape for the color for any other features that we might introduce so this model feature integration it's  all about extracting features and then recombining them when there are lots of distractors it's much easier to discriminate an object among competitors if it only differs in one feature it becomes much more difficult if there are more features this is important because it illustrates a difference between two different ways of implementing algorithms that single feature difference can be detected with what we call parallel search you can actually scan all of the items in the scene at the same time  but only if there's a single feature difference whereas the multiple feature difference can only be detected with serial search you have to scan each item one at a time this gets at a core difference between serial processing and parallel processing serial processing is a type of processing where each step of the algorithm has to be taken consecutively you have to scan one object at a time you can only do one thing at a time parallel processing refers to algorithms where multiple steps can occur  simultaneously you can scan multiple objects all at the same time so this is one of those open questions in cognitive science does our brain use parallel or serial processing and what feature integration shows us is it really seems to depend on the task and it seems to depend on the parameters of the task so the real question is when can we use parallel processing and when can we use serial processing in this case serial search is slow and effortful right you have to manually inspect every shape and evaluate it  you're paying attention to each letter one by one whereas parallel search is quick and easy right none of the tasks that you do in parallel is very difficult on its own and you can solve this problem really quickly so parallel processing definitely has some advantages this is the advantage of speed but it's not something we can do all of the time certain things will require more effort and they will require us to do them one step at a time okay so we've talked about several models of visual object recognition  template matching theory recognition by components feature detection these try to answer the question of what types of representations we build and how we manipulate them and in all cases the representation was some kind of mental image but what does that entail how do we manipulate mental imagery i'm going to switch tracks a bit and we're going to talk now about mental imagery itself and the types of transformations and operations we can apply to imagistic representations so we can think of things as happening  in our mind's eye right we all seem to have a mind's eye where we can view objects and scenes and people from our memory and if we engage in introspection we realize that our imaginations for most of us are pretty powerful we can manipulate the image in our mind's eye we can zoom in or zoom out we can rotate the image we can move through a scene and all of these actions can be described as operations performed on mental representations these are all fundamentally transformations on mental images or imagistic  representations so what kinds of operations can you perform with a mental image well you can zoom in you can pan across an image you can scan looking for specific things imagine a scene containing objects of different sizes you can zoom in on a particular object then you can zoom out to view the whole scene imagine a familiar landscape you can pan across the landscape viewing the whole scene in a sweeping motion just the way you would with a video camera we can also rotate objects to perform identification tasks  suppose you see something and you want to know if it matches something from another angle we can take that thing in our mind's eye and we can rotate it to see if it matches remember recognition by components the representation generated was an assembly of 3d shapes of geons so those mental images they're not just images they're actually three-dimensional objects that we can manipulate to view from any angle and that explains view invariance the idea that these mental images are invariant so what can we deduce about these  operations how can we make inferences about the representations the mental images and the operations that are being performed on them let's do a little experiment i'm going to show you an image of an elephant and a rabbit study the image for a few seconds and then i'll ask you a question [Music] which way was the rabbit facing if you said to the left you are correct i'm going to show you another image this time of a rabbit and a fly study the image for a few seconds and then i'll ask you a question  [Music] which way was the rabbit facing [Music] if you said to the left again you are correct now obviously this is probably pretty easy because it was the same rabbit both times and it was facing the same direction and you knew what the task was but if you had a sense that it was a little bit easier to answer the second time it could have also been for another reason if it seemed a little bit easier for you to remember which way the rabbit was facing when it was next to the fly well it may interest you to know that a study  had found that people were actually quicker to respond when they were asked about the larger animal in the image why should that be the case why should it matter if i'm asking a question about the larger or the smaller animal well think about that zoom operation you can zoom in on your mental image to see something in more detail and zooming in on your mental image presumably takes time it doesn't come for free you have to spend the time to actually zoom in the way you would with a camera with a lens  the rabbit is smaller than the elephant in the first picture so it requires more zooming therefore it takes you a little bit longer it might take you a little bit longer to answer the question so here we have a model about mental imagery that says that we zoom in on objects in a visual scene to inspect them and that gives us a few steps it gives us an algorithm step one you have to retrieve the image from your memory step two you scan the image for the relevant figure you've got to find the rabbit  step three gonna zoom in on that figure and then step four you have to inspect the figure to find out which direction it's facing so all of those steps take time and when you're asked about the smaller animal it requires more time for that step three for zooming in so we have this algorithm but how can we make predictions about behavior what links the steps of the algorithm that process to a behavior we can actually observe we need a way of linking those two things together and that's related to levels of analysis  we need to link our algorithmic model to behavior we need another model we need a behavioral model and in this case it's pretty simple we just say each step in the algorithm takes time and that will allow us to make predictions because if you have one step that takes more time than another then you can predict that it will take that person longer to generate a response so this algorithm contains several steps and our behavioral model says that when we perform these steps it takes time performing more steps takes longer  having to do more work on any particular step will also take longer that will result in zooming in on the smaller animal in the image taking more time than zooming in on the large animal and that means that because you took more time to zoom in it will take you more time to answer the question so then we can work the reasoning in reverse and say if we see a person take longer to answer the question it must be because it took them longer to zoom in on the image and that tells us something about how we  are manipulating those mental images in our mind's eye what kinds of operations we are performing it gives us evidence for that particular algorithm okay let's try another experiment imagine i give you a map to study with several features on it like a hill a lake a wishing well a gnarled old tree try to remember as much as you can about this map and where things are located okay now bring up the map in your mind's eye think of one feature the wishing well now think of another feature the hut in your mind's eye  draw a line from the wishing well to the hut pretty easy right okay now do it again think of the wishing well bring it up in your mind's eye draw a line to the boulder at the top of the map did both of those things take the same amount of time or did it feel like it took a little bit longer to draw a line from the wishing well to the boulder a study in 1978 found that it took participants longer on average to perform that operation if the features on the map were farther apart when participants were instructed to  draw a line from one point to another the amount of time that it took to imagine that line traveling across the map was proportionate almost exactly linearly proportionate to the distance on the map okay but are there any issues with this the participants were instructed to imagine the line moving across the map at a constant rate so in this case maybe the results are just an artifact of the way the participants were instructed question is is there a way to control for that well let's think about  mental rotation suppose i give you two 3d objects at various degrees of rotation would you be able to decide if they are the same object well what are some possible ways that we can perform this operation how can we solve this problem figure out if two images match or not how would a computer perform this rotation operation well i can think of two possible algorithms that can solve this problem algorithm one we might use cartesian coordinates we just track all of the vertices of that three-dimensional  figure in some kind of three-dimensional cartesian space and then we apply a mathematical transformation to see if the two figures match each other of course i can also imagine another algorithm in this algorithm instead of using a cartesian coordinate system and a mathematical transformation we will use a 3d mental image the same type that you might generate in the recognition by components theory and what we're going to do is we're going to take that three-dimensional mental image and we're going to rotate  the image in real time going through every visual angle until we make a match so we're looking at an object here we're looking at an object here and we want to know if they're the same so we have to rotate it in our mind's eye to see if it matches okay but the real question is can we make different predictions from these two hypotheses we have two possible algorithms but we need a theory that links each of these algorithms with some kind of behavior that we can observe we need a behavioral model  well applying mathematical transforms to cartesian coordinate sets is going to take time and mental rotation is also going to take some time any kind of mental operation you do takes time but if we use math it really shouldn't matter how much rotation there is it shouldn't matter how far apart the two figures are in terms of rotation applying that cartesian transform applies to the same number of coordinates either way right each object is made of the same number of coordinates so we have to do the same  amount of math no matter how far apart they are but if we're using mental imagery and we apply some kind of actual rotation it might actually take longer if the difference between the two is greater so if rotation takes time then doing more rotation will take more time so it will matter what degree of rotation the two figures display in a study in 1971 shepard and metzler did exactly this experiment and what they found was that image identification tracked almost perfectly linearly with the degree of rotation  if we had used cartesian math then all of these should have taken the same amount of time the fact that we're using mental rotation means that the bigger differences actually do take us longer as difference in angles increases reaction time also increases so it takes us a lot longer to determine if two objects are the same or different if their angular difference is great as opposed to if their angular difference is very small this is good evidence that we are actually doing some kind of mental  rotation in our mind's eye we actually are representing the images as three-dimensional objects and then rotating them in real time to see if they match so this pattern of increasing reaction time with increasing angular difference is fantastic evidence that shows us not only what kind of algorithm we're using but also the representation the way that we are representing these objects in our mind so not only do we actively use mental imagery we're applying transformations to these mental images that seem very  similar to physical transformations to the transformations we might apply to physical objects rotating them or zooming in and out and these inferences can be made by applying models to make predictions about behavior and then testing those predictions which is an important part of how cognitive science has functioned for decades okay i want to review some key concepts from this lecture we talked about several theories of object recognition including template matching using exemplars from memory to compare to what  we are seeing now to see if they match we talked about recognition by components taking images of things in the world converting them into three-dimensional models using primitive shapes called geons and we talked about feature integration which is really about detecting things in noise or detecting objects among distractors kind of the where's waldo problem we talked about parallel versus serial processing certain processes we can do many steps at the same time we saw this with feature integration if we're trying  to find waldo and he is extremely different from everything around him if there's only a single feature that we actually need to pay attention to then we can scan an entire image in one step and the image will pop out to us if there's more than one feature different then we'll have to scan each object one at a time we have to do a serial process and that takes a lot longer we also talked about the transformations that we can apply to our mental images things like panning scanning zooming and especially mental rotation now we can  use experiments with behavioral models to see those differences and to make inferences about what we're doing inside our mind's eye how we're manipulating information imagistic representations to make sense of the world around us our next lecture we're going to talk more about sensation and perception but we're going to move this to another sensory modality we're going to talk about audition we're going to talk about hearing we're going to talk about it specifically in the context of trying to make sense out of spoken language  how do we understand what other people are saying 
AB60	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjvFLbQTuzQ	didn't see you there let's think about how we experience the world humans are very visual creatures we're often looking at things with our eyes it's a very common mode we have for experiencing things in the outside world so how does that work well light bounces off an object that light ricochets and enters your eyes goes through some pathways into your brain where it's converted into some kind of format that your brain can recognize it's turned into a mental representation so you've taken something  from the outside world and you converted it into a form that can exist in your mind that's cool but how does that actually result in experience how does that result in me having an internal experience of the outside world you've managed to create a mind internal representation of the outside world you've got an image inside your mind instead of outside of it but there's a problem how do you experience the image usually we think of images as something you have to see with your eyes if you see something in the world  take that information and you turn it into a mental representation and the form that mental representation takes is a mental image well it kind of seems like something inside your mind still has to view it so how does this work [Music] [Applause] enter the cartesian theater we might refer to this as the mind's eye and we might think of it as the center of consciousness this is the place inside our minds where we experience the world remember that we are sort of trapped inside our bodies we don't have direct  access to the outside world except through these narrow channels through our sensory experience sensory information comes in through our sense organs and then it filters into this interior part of ourselves into the center of consciousness into our mind's eye our cartesian theater and that's where we see and sense things from the outside world it seems like a plausible story information comes in from the outside and once it's inside then you can experience it but there may be a problem with this  we've introduced another layer that still requires an experiencer so what is it that's inside you that's going to view those images once they come from the outside world inside your mind it seems we have to introduce another agent another experiencer some kind of homunculus that can view the mental images now that they're inside your mind okay maybe that can work maybe we do have like a little version of ourselves inside our minds that can experience things once they go into the mind but of course there's still a problem  how does the homunculus experience the images if you converted images into mental representations and then still required another viewer to actually view them the homunculus is going to have the same problem that you did now the mental images are going to go into the homunculus's eyes and he will convert it into a form he can understand but he won't be able to view it he'll need another homunculus inside his mind to convert it and to view it and that introduces an infinite regress each homunculus needs its own homunculus  and each of the next homunculus will need its own homunculus etcetera etcetera to eternity this infinite regress is also sometimes called a grounding problem the infinite regress means there's no ground for the process the process just keeps receding further and further to infinity what will view the mental images well there's another experiencer inside you that will view them well what's inside that experiencer well there's another experience inside that experiencer it's homunculi all the way down so how can a mind experience the  world if every mind requires another embedded mind to view and interpret the representations this is actually a huge problem how can we resolve this how can we make sense of how we make sense of the outside world from an internal perspective how can we take things from the outside world and experience them inside our minds without requiring another embedded mind to experience our own mental representations and another embedded mind to experience the representations of that embedded mind and so on and so  on and so on how can we stop the regress how can we introduce a ground into this grounding problem cognitive science is full of huge questions like how do we define the mind how do we define experience how do we define the self in relation to minds like when i say i experienced something what does the eye refer to what actually did the experiencing was it my brain was it some sub part of my brain maybe only a small piece of my brain is actually actively experiencing things or is it the sum total of me does it  require all of my parts acting together what if i lose some of my parts am i still me can i still experience everything and then how does this apply to computers and ai do computers have minds do they experience the world in any way that we would recognize these are big important questions and these are the kinds of questions that i want us to think about and grapple with and there are no easy answers here this all relates to an ancient puzzle called the mind body problem are mental states separable from  physical states is there a way to resolve the problem of experience while respecting causality the mind body problem is the intersection of two realms the physical and the mental what's the relationship between the physical realm and the mental realm is the mental realm entirely non-physical is the mental realm in some way grounded in the physical realm the mind and body kind of seem like different things right the body is matter it's biology it's physical it's measurable it's directly observable  it obeys clear cause and effect and physical laws the mind is a totally different animal it consists of thoughts and beliefs and emotions they're not material or biological they don't seem to be physical are they measurable it's not clear whether we can measure these things in a direct way can they even be directly observed do they obey physical laws it's hard to say these feel like very different kinds of things yet there must be some kind of causal relationship between the mind and the body we know that we are made of matter and  we are subject to physical laws and we know that we are also capable of thoughts and beliefs and desires and emotions unless we are willing to violate causality there must be some kind of causal link between these two realms so what is the nature of that causal relationship between mind and body there are many many proposed answers to this question and we'll talk about several of these in the next lecture we'll talk about them in more detail one proposal is dualism maybe the material brain is too  different from immaterial conscious experience for them to be the same kind of thing maybe conscious experience and thoughts are completely non-physical and maybe they take the form of some kind of non-physical substance maybe matter and mind are two entirely different kinds of things maybe they're composed of entirely different kinds of substances maybe there is a hard line separating the two a duality between mind and body by contrast monism says no there's only one substance the mind conscious experience  physical reality they're all in the same domain they're all made of the same kind of stuff of course there are a few different flavors of monism you might say that everything is physical maybe the mind and the body are the same in the sense that everything ultimately has a material physical cause but you could also take another approach and say well maybe everything is mental if there are two apparent kinds of things mental stuff and physical stuff that we think ultimately coalesces into a single kind of thing  sure it could all be physical but could it also all be mental and there are a lot of traditions that treat the entire universe in this way that maybe the entire universe is all just mental stuff in one form or another but if we think that mind and body at some level are fundamentally the same thing because everything ultimately has to be physical which i think is a rational thing to think and seems to be what most people believe that the universe that we live in is full of physical matter so everything that we see and interact with  in the physical universe must ultimately be explained in terms of physical matter question is can we describe mental states in terms of physical states like what is pain why does pain feel bad and could we say that pain is some particular firing of neurons in humans if each of us has a slightly different brain and a slightly different pattern of neurons and a slightly different pattern of neural firing in response to pain what is it that unifies our experiences together in the physical sense so the mind body problem is all about  the direction of influence between the body and mind it's about that causal link does the mind control the body does the body control the mind does it work both ways is there a meaningful difference between body and mind i think intuitively the mind seems to control the body i think that's how we sort of intuitively think about ourselves right think oh i was hungry so i got up and i got something to eat that's my mind telling me what to do and it sort of relates to the concept of free will which incidentally is a huge  can of worms that i don't think we should get too far into but say we assume we have free will and we direct our own actions well what does that really mean when you make a decision what exactly is it that's making the decision where do our thoughts come from we could assume that there's something inside us that directs our thoughts but what directs the thoughts of that thing it's the homunculus problem all over again we get another infinite regress so how can we solve this how can we solve the problem of action  the problem of mind interacting with matter i want to make a distinction between what the mind does and how it feels to do those things the problem is experience feels really subjective and that subjective feeling is called qualia dan dennis says qualia is an unfamiliar term for something that could not be more familiar to each of us the ways things seem to us so quality is just another word for that subjective experience we have of the world each of us has some kind of subjective experience the  way the world seems to us and we don't have access to each other's subjective experience i don't know if yours is the same as mine and i can't know and there are a lot of interesting questions we could ask about this like would a mind instantiated in something other than a brain have a similar kind of subjective experience this is an extremely important question now that we are getting further and further towards general artificial intelligence our artificial intelligences having a subjective experience  maybe not now but will they someday is that even possible is it conceivable would an intelligent computer a truly intelligent computer experience the world the same way as a human why why not right now we don't know and it's not clear if we can ever know but if not if you think the answer to this is definitely no my question to you would be what is it that precludes it from consideration as a mind what do you think about a computer rules it out from having qualia is there anything special about human minds or human brains  that enables us to have subjective experiences or is this something that we could in principle replicate let me put it this way mr amer the 9000 series is the most reliable computer ever made no 9000 computer has ever made a mistake or distorted information do you believe that hal has genuine emotions well he acts like he has genuine emotions um of course he's programmed that way to make it easier for us to talk to him but as to whether or not he has real feelings is something i don't think anyone can truthfully answer  the philosopher thomas nagle wrote a really influential paper called what is it like to be a bat it's a pretty provocative title thomas nagle says there's something that it is like to have a conscious mental state and he uses the example of a bat say imagine that you're a bad [Music] well really you can't imagine what it's like to be about you have no idea we have no idea what their experience of the world is like and they don't know what ours is like i don't know what yours is like it's totally inaccessible  this kind of an anti-reductionist account there is some kind of subjective experience that can't be explained by physical processes we can't imagine what it's like to be a bat because conscious experience itself is totally subjective even if we could fully explain what a bat is doing we can fully explain a bad physiology what kinds of computations the bat brain is performing we can describe that echolocation using those three levels of analysis but just because we can describe and understand echolocation  does that mean that we know what it's like to be a bat thomas nagel would say no of course not you have no idea there's something missing here you haven't actually been a bat you cannot know what the subjective experience of being a bad is like unless you have been a bat and have experienced the world as a bat so what is it like to be you can it be described could you describe to another person what it's like to be you what your subjective experience of the world is like the problem is we can only describe what  for example what bats are doing in objective scientific terms we can talk about sound waves and we can talk about the brain and we can say oh we can actually replicate this process using computers and sonar but those terms those objective scientific terms just don't seem to be sufficient to describe our internal subjective experience maybe we have a better idea of what it's like to be other people maybe you can imagine what it's like to be me and i can imagine what it's like to be you and i might have a better  understanding of that than what it would be like to be a bat but i still can't be sure every time someone tells you what they're thinking or feeling if they tell you what their subjective experience of the world is it's mediated by language we can only express it to another person through language or maybe dance or maybe art or maybe music but it's always going to be filtered through some kind of lens and that means that we'll never really be sure because we don't have direct access to anyone else's  subjective internal experience i can't ever be sure if mine is really like yours science gives objective accounts of phenomena using the scientific method we define terms we test hypotheses hypotheses have to be falsifiable we can describe things at different levels of analysis but experience is subjective and if consciousness is subjective can cognitive science explain it this is a big question for us cognitive science takes a very firm stance we have a very solid framework for viewing the mind as an information processor viewing  the mind in terms of computation representation the flow of information inputs and outputs is there a way that we can ever reach a description of conscious experience a description of qualia using those terms using those descriptive tools it's not exactly clear okay so what does all this have to do with functionalism remember that functionalism is our foundational framework for cognitive science cognitive scientists are going to view the mind in functional terms so if minds can be instantiated in  radically different physical systems which we believe if we're functionalists remember that's multiple realizability that multiple different physical systems can realize the same kinds of mental states so if that's true if different minds can be instantiated in radically different physical systems does that mean that they can have similar subjective experience can consciousness exist in other systems this is all really about the perceived difference between human minds and computers and this is something i feel  really strongly about so i bring it up a lot and i talk about it a lot and you might get sick of it and you probably have your own really strong opinions about this how different are human minds and computers do computers have minds well functionalism claims that anything that shares the functionality of a mind is a mind so the question then is do computers fit this definition currently maybe they don't could they is it at least in principle possible for computers to meet this definition maybe but maybe there is an insurmountable  qualitative divide between brains and computers can a computer experience qualia would a computer have to experience qualia in order to qualify as having a mind could we conceive of minds that don't have subjective internal experience and why should we doubt that a computer could have consciousness or qualia i think the usual answer to this is that computers can't think or feel anything subjectively because they have to be told what to think or feel which wouldn't be qualitative right because it's programmed by someone who  knows how to describe it computers don't seem to do anything on their own they have to be told or programmed and quality is supposed to be self-generated is that enough to say that computers don't have qualia i think that that would mean that it would be functionally impossible for us to ever instill subjective experience into a machine maybe that's true i think it remains to be seen but there's a bigger issue here which is we may never know because it might not be something that we can ever observe  okay i want to do a quick thought experiment this is thought experiment by the philosopher frank jackson it's called the mary's room experiment and the scenario goes like this mary is a brilliant scientist who is for whatever reason which we won't get into forced to investigate the world from a black and white room via a black and white television monitor maybe a more modern way to imagine the scenario is that mary is forced to interact only through vr and the vr is only feeding her images in black and white  so mary's entire experience of the world is totally devoid of color she specializes in the neurophysiology of vision and acquires all the physical information there is to obtain about what goes on when we see ripe tomatoes or the sky and use terms like red or blue so on she discovers for example just exactly which wavelength combinations from the sky stimulate the retina and exactly how this produces via the central nervous system the contraction of the vocal cords and explosion of air from the lungs that result in the  uttering of the sentence the sky is blue so what will happen when mary is released from her black and white room or is given a color television monitor will she learn something that's the question mary knows everything there is to know about the color blue the color red about the physiology of how those colors are observed and perceived about how we utter sentences in response to having seen them she knows everything there is to know about the physical systems but she has never personally experienced  it she's never seen the color blue or the color red so if she walks out of that room for the first time and sees the sky will she learn something this is fundamentally getting to the core issue of whether you believe in qualia whether you believe there is something to human cognition that cannot be explained by just reference to the physical if mary leaves the room sees the sky for the first time and gains some new knowledge when she sees that color blue then you have to admit that qualia exists  if you think mary has learned something by that experience then you believe in qualia because what has she gained when she leaves the room she gains the knowledge of the qualia by experiencing it and if you accept that then you have to accept that there's more to know about sensation than the physical properties and those three levels of description mary may be able to learn something about what blue feels like to her her subjective experience of blue and that's completely separate from the objective scientific descriptions which  can be shared by other people so jackson uses this argument to argue against physicalism everything can't just all be physical stuff there's got to be something else qualia are real and qualia are not physical okay so how does all of this fit together well i compare brains to computers a lot you're going to hear me do this a lot i'm going to keep doing it i'm not going to stop i'm not going to stop comparing brains to computers i'm in too deep and it's a really useful metaphor in cognitive science but of course there  are persistent problems with this and one problem for functionalism is that a machine could be programmed to see the color red it could even mimic the same human functional process but that machine maybe wouldn't have the same experience of what it's like to see red that a person would have so what we could program a computer to know would be similar to what mary knows before she first experiences blue for herself if you program a computer to know what blue is it knows all of the facts about blue but it hasn't experienced it in the  way that we experience it and that's exactly like mary in the room she knows everything there is to know about it but she hasn't experienced it personally okay what about computers that have visual sensory transducers you attach a camera to a computer and it can see it can gather visual information but what is it actually representing it has to be some kind of coding of the visual information that's pre-programmed right you have to convert that visual information into a format that it can experience  is that really an experience the way that we think we have experiences i think a functionalist might argue that these are not actually very different when a human being sees something in the outside world we translate that into information that can be represented mentally and if you hook up camera up to a computer it's converting information from the outside world into a format that it can represent internally it's not clear what's missing when we translate from computers to human beings that missing piece qualia  it's a persistent mystery so it's not clear to me whether there is a significant qualitative difference between humans and computers for all i know my computer is having qualia it is having a subjective internal experience it just can't express that to me i don't have access to it maybe not maybe it's not having any internal experience but we can't know because we don't have direct access to it okay so just to review some of the key concepts we talked about today we talked about the cartesian theater the idea  that maybe we have some kind of internal mind's eye where we can view mental images of course that introduces a problem in the form of the infinite regress the grounding problem if you need to have an experiencer inside your mind in order to experience things in the cartesian theater then that experiencer must also have a mind which will also require another internal experiencer and so on and so on and so on we talked about the mind-body problem what's the relationship between the mind and the body there must be some kind of  causal link some kind of causal relationship between mind and body what direction does it go how does it work how do we link these two things which seem very different and we talked about qualia that's sort of missing piece that can't be explained by physicalism can't be explained in terms of physical matter the subjective experience that we all have but that we can't share with each other and we're not sure whether we share with other organisms or with machines so these are big questions how does all  of this fit together in the next lecture we're going to talk more about the mind-body problem we're going to talk more about some of the proposed solutions to the mind-body problem and that causal relationship

AB67	https://youtu.be/8AUdIBttXSg?si=_ctinaX499rhJsl9	hello hello hello aitey here your pop culture psychic back to you again with another reading this time it's on something fun unique and interesting we're going to do Cleopatra what was she like and where is her tomb so I've seen some videos on Tik Tok recently about a woman who is close to finding Cleopatra's tomb and she had said that no man will ever find her tomb and a woman now is close to finding said tomb so I want to do a reading and see if I can find out maybe where it is or anything like that but I also want to  kind of see what Cleopatra was like you know um I know a lot of stuff over the years has kind of you know been questionable and I want to see if I can figure this out so honestly I don't know how this is going to go I don't know how accurate this will be but it's a fun test for me and I'm excited so remember these Rings all leged from tapers only and let's get started if you guys like these you can join my YouTube members there's a $5 $10 $15 TI get access to exclusive pick a cards story times and you can win a  reading from me also I have a second second YouTube channel called amrite T tea and it has non- tarot content on that if you'd like okay so this is her what she was like let's see huh wow she really liked power okay I would say that I do not think that Cleopatra was a girls girl dare I say that you would call her a Pik me if she was alive now um okay so she is the five of Pentacles which tells me that she absolutely loved being in power the five of Pentacles says she loved having power over other people I think for her she  was sick and tired of men having power over her and so she wanted power over them um and so I just see her as very power hungry R um the Queen of Swords is reversed and the nine of Pentacles reversed as well which tells me that I definitely see her as competitive even the three of Cups here the T of Wands the KN of Cups immaturity burdens waste of time three of Cups jealousy gossip distrust disloyalty um that makes me feel like she was a very competitive person it was her her way or the highway  I definitely feel like she was competitive with everyone around her I absolutely think she was competitive with other women um Queen of Swords reversed I don't really think she was a girls girl in fact I think she was very judgmental of other women um not in a way of like I'm better than you but in a way of why don't you feel the way I feel um when I'm in her energy I think she was just ahead of her time so for her she feels like why are why aren't you fighting back why aren't you trying to be like that like why aren't you trying  to be like the men why aren't you trying to be like this I think she just didn't really respect a lot of people that didn't want to push forward and and do things like she was unique I just see her as like very indiv individualistic very unique um and like No Nonsense so I feel like she was kind of just like you guys all want to follow the mold and you guys just want to be pretty and get what you can get uh I want to be pretty and and and have control and have power so for me I I definitely see her very  competitive with others but I also feel like she's this type of person who just is like you're pathetic like your ideas are pathetic the way you think is pathetic get out of my way so again I feel like like in my mind's eye I see her being like you're pathetic and lazy and all you want to do is follow the the leader like it just seems to me like she just like looks down on people that just are like MPC behavior and why aren't you fighting the system why aren't you trying to be the best like I just see her as like dismissive  to other women other people who are just passive you're looking at a pack leader you're looking at like a like an alpha like this is a leader this is someone who is a natural-born leader this is someone that doesn't really need friends this is someone that didn't really have interest in having friends this is someone who like was like I'm going to get whatever I want at all costs very driven very hungry um very much what I would expect a queen to be um there is a reason that she was in power um now  what's interesting here is um the nine of Pentacles reverse and the Queen of Swords when it comes to relationships um you know what she reminds me of a little bit here here H nine of Pentacles is like walking on eggshells okay the Two of Pentacles is an even exchange and the Knight of Pentacles is consistency I think there's a part of her that was pissed off that anytime she was interested in a guy or anytime she did something with a guy people would gravitate towards the man um cuz the Moon is upright and the  king of Cups which means like I honestly feel like perhaps before I don't know exactly the story of Cleopatra but is there potential for her to have like been behind the scenes before she got the throne because the Moon is upright the king of Cups and the 10 of Cups which is like a happily ever after a family so for me that makes me feel like she was already doing things behind the scenes and there was a figure head there's a male figure head here that she was actually like in charge of like she was  giving advice or someone's like plus one or someone's like assistant it's almost like if someone was an assistant she was helping someone so the king of Cups tells me that there's a male here that was like a figurehead that she was helping or doing something for um behind the scenes almost like again I understand this a long time ago so I'm giving you like current references so you can kind of understand the energy I'm in I obviously can't explain what life was like back then so I have to use modern explanation so don't come for me  but she was definitely doing something cuz we're looking at the 10 of Cups which is like happily ever after our family then the king of Cups and the moon which is like deception and lies that means that there was a male figure head um you know I don't know happy Liv after family something related to that I don't know um again I don't really know the history of Cleopatra sorry I'm going in here completely blind um that being said I think for her she when she was picking a partner I think that she liked being  alone I think she didn't want a partner I think for her she was like there was a fearfulness of like oh really so they're going to give more attention to the man they're going to give more attention to the guy like there's just like it's just weird how she was just kind of like she didn't want to share the spotlight with anyone so temp High Priestess and king of Pentacles I think that she looked for the perfect man that was submissive I think she looked for a sensitive submissive person so it's  interesting to me maybe they're not submissive to you but they were submissive to her if that makes sense like you might still see them as dominant because I feel like dominance always seeks dominance but this person was more submissive to her which she liked this person was more sensitive this person was more emotional and I think really enjoyed that um I actually do think that um I forget who she married but I do think that whoever she married I do think that's the person that I'm talking about I do  think that she genuinely loved him the strength card is reversed the eight of cops and seven of Swords I think it's the only person she ever loved actually truthfully I feel like it's the only person she ever loved I don't think she loved anyone previously I don't think she thought she could love anyone previously and I actually genuinely believe that she loved this person person cuz I can feel her being like in life and death we will never part I can actually feel that and I feel her being like I don't want anything  without you so it's it's and she got what she wanted too it's like she interesting seven of Swords Eight of Cups and strength reverse though was like it's a vulnerability in her that um people were not used to seeing I also think it might have been a little bit of like I think there were some qualms about that it seems like some people were like oh she's getting weak because she's sensitive to a man it's almost like some cracks in her foundation started to happen when it comes to her leadership  because of her love that she had for him she softened death n of Wands and four revers yeah because I see her positioning herself you know what's interesting the fools reversed the Knight of Wands and death again I don't normally know the history of Cleopatra but I definitely can tell you straight up like she was doing what she needed to do to get into the position she needed to get into it reminds me a lot of like what the royal family drama is about these days and like you know politics and stuff she needed to do what she  needed to do and she would use men to get where she needed to go to her men were were tools men were obstacles men were tools uh I don't think she gave a [ __ ] about men until she met that one guy I don't know which one that is is but until she met that one guy it definitely feels like she didn't think it was possible for her but she definitely fell header Over Heels I'm also seeing poetry so I'm wondering if he was like a poet or May music there's something like romantic about this male energy around her that  feels like I don't know how things were back then were there people who were doing things like close to poetry or like things like that like a soft because what I'm seeing is literally the fool card so it's like someone playing like like an instrument just like Melancholy kind of like sitting on a a rock just like playing an instrument so to me that means that there was some sort of Carefree energy some sort of like Whimsical nature um like a romantic romantic energy and I'm seeing writing very Whimsical very like Pisces like  energy like a dreamer so and it's interesting cuz I almost feel like I don't know did anybody else want this person I can't tell if anybody else wanted to this person I feel like she it's almost like she plucked someone out of somewhere and there's some sort of controversy with that it's like she plucked I see her like plucking someone out and being like this one and people being shocked that that's the one that she liked it's like the crowd it's like if someone was like in the back unnoticed and then she clears the crowd  and she goes that one I like that one you're different interesting it's almost like she could see auras and the aura was different because I see like an aura from this person and I see her feeling like I can it's almost like she can see his aura yeah cuz it's almost like she didn't see this coming this love she didn't see this coming H didn't think it was possible for her very very hardened heart that softened from this person H what's interesting too is that huh what's interesting too is that I  feel like this is someone that this is someone that I feel like didn't play her game you know how I when I read Taylor Swift and Joe aln Al was kind of just like I don't care I'm not impressed that's what this guy feels like he was so in his own world that he didn't really care about her world and I think that's what she liked isn't it interesting how the tropes of Love were the same back then as they are now huh Two of Wands reverse Six of Swords four of Swords was there something forbidden just keep seeing this was  there something forbidden about their love Six of Swords it's like and the Two of Wands like we're not supposed to be together and four of Swords like some sort of rejection or taboo maybe Six of Swords is also like sneaking away and sneaking sneaking around so there's some sort of taboo I also don't know if I would necessarily say that um I mean I don't think that she was the most beautiful person in the planet I also don't think this person was either six of Wands reversed hangman reversed and Five of  Swords tells me it wasn't beauty that brought either of them together Five of Swords in the Hang Man though is about having to sacrifice others to be together or sacrifice things to be together so I guess I should have probably did research on Cleopatra cuz I actually have no [ __ ] idea was she married did she have more than one M like uh partner did she have more than one husband like I don't [ __ ] know to be honest the most I know about Cleopatra is that Trisha p is dressed up as her um Three of Swords reversed Ace of  Wands reversed and seven of Pentacles I almost see it as like she was talking to someone and then it was forbidden for her to talk to she stopped talking and then they returned it's like almost like I sent you out on a trip did she send someone out on a trip to get something to her to fetch something for her there's a period of time where we talk we stop then we ret talk but I also feel like she sends someone on a trip to go grab something for her I see a fetch Quest quote unquote so you need to go get something  for me is what I'm seeing like you need to go get something for me and I don't know if it's to prove your love or whatever and then something Shady for them to get together yeah look at that two of Swords you have to separate something judgment Carter something you would be judged about um magician upright and judgment it would be something the girls would talk about it would be something taboo okay I want to see if we can find out where a tomb is let's see if we could do that we got you a little info about miss  m now let's see if we can figure out where the tomb is so I saw one Tik Tok and to be honest with you was long so I kind of skimmed it something about she thinks it's in the ocean or something so let's kind of see if that's accurate or not make sure I shuffle these really well okay where is it didn't they say that she buried her tomb next to a man cuz I agree King of Swords Queen of Pentacles seven of Wands do I think someone will find it eventually yes seven of Wands an dog it's where you least expect it by  the way um think of the seven of Wands as hiding it in plain sight um so it's absolutely where you least expect it I also see the king reversed and the queen reversed those was my first two polls so that makes me feel like it is next to a king or close to a king or close to another person it has to be close to another person um or at least it was maybe got moved um look at this it might not be the king you think it is though um or it might not be the person you think it is that that she's next to  that's also could be that so King Of Wands reverse Tower and Empress I definitely feel oh yeah oh yeah what I say it like that um I definitely feel like her [ __ ] was moved Tower means that some sort of catastrophic event happened to the land that that made things move yes um that's that's the Tower and the empress is her so to me something moved her [ __ ] around something like a dramatic catastropic events like lightning hitting and and destruction and something moved her for sure yes I Al two of cops is she buried with  someone or something oh God I should have did my research cu the two of cups is like again I wonder if it is it her lover the two of cups is like her with someone else or she has someone else's belongings or something page of Wands is upright in the Justice card she's like it's like if I was holding something tightly or holding someone's hand or holding something important tightly she might have an important artifact actually maybe she was buried with an important artifact Justice is upright too there's  a lot of secrets in her tomb I keep seeing Clues there are clues in other people's spaces and maybe in other tombs or in other structures there are clues in other structures as to where she is I'm seeing her okay you guys are going to roll your eyes I'm seeing Taylor Swift in my head you know how she leaves Clues and all of her [ __ ] that's what I think Cleopatra did I also think she left Clues Geo geographically but a lot of the clues got destroyed so it's like if I were to put an arrow in a rock and The Rock got  destroyed you no longer have the arrow but there are still some things that exist most of them have been destroyed but there was absolutely some like I see like someone writing higher gics on a wall of somewhere else and kind of smirking about it and it's not just her that did this it's almost like her followers did this even when she died people were still obsessed with her and so there were still followers of hers that wanted to keep her memory alive and the things that she was obsessed with alive so I'm seeing them do the same  thing that she did it's like they They carried out her Legacy so I mean it makes sense right we worship idols now of course there were worshiping Idols back then so you know that makes sense to me that she had I guess you could kind of see that as like maybe like a little cult or a fandom or whatever but there were people that were like yeah like we're going to keep the Queen's memory alive people I don't think people hated her maybe maybe I'm wrong but I don't see people hating her to beon honest which is interesting you  would think they would but I don't see people hating her I don't know if I would necessarily say there's also someone that I think people would expect her to be with but she's not I don't know what that means or maybe there's someone they expect her to be near and she's not I don't know what that means four of Pentacles reversed four of Wands revers she's definitely been moved but what she's she was deep four of Pentacles makes me feel like deep deep deep like somewhere deep I guess that could be the  ocean but even before the ocean I feel like she was deep I'm seeing tunnels I'm seeing like if you dug the deepest hole you could and dropped it in so that makes me feel like it's like tunnels was there an underground system somewhere cuz I'm seeing like an ant colony which and you know how ants make like a massive underground tunnel system is was that a thing Three of Wands hant and Knight of Pentacles inconsistencies Three of Wands hierophant yeah it's like if if I were to make a bunch of if I were to make a  bunch of hidden tuttles and some of them would get you trapped there I'm I see see like I know we talk about like you guys are going roll your eyes but I see like booby traps so I'm like there definitely feels like there are rooms that are like booby trapped or there was I don't know if that's a real thing or if that's a metaphor it's giving Indiana Jones maybe I'm aging myself with that reference judgement upright magician and seven of Pentacles the simplest roote is the roote to take is what I keep hearing the  simplest roote is the roote to take keep straight what does that mean I don't know what that means um the sun's upright the Queen of Wands and the star reversed there's something either in her tomb or outside of it there's something related to a woman that she did not like I see a silhouette of a woman and an ex through her and that's what this is this is like someone that she didn't like someone that like wanted to Dethrone her and there's something dedicated I'm screaming you guys are going to think  I'm crazy but there's someone there's something dedicated to her Ops there's something dedicated to an OP I'm not joking like it's like if I curse you in my death there's something to an OP you guys are going to think I'm [ __ ] batshit but I see it it might not translate as literal as I see it remember I'm using modernday terminology because I wasn't alive back then so I don't know how to get you to see this and I'm only going to see things in pictures and and visuals that are of modern day so I can pick up on the  metaphors that I'm seeing but I absolutely see some sort of dedication to an OP what I'm seeing is like if it like if it's like if you if like it's like what I'm seeing in my mind's eye is like if I died and I said in my tomb or in the room of my tomb put a picture of that [ __ ] I don't like and an ax through her face obviously that's not probably literal but that's kind of what I'm seeing is like there's there's a dedication to like a [ __ ] you like like when I die there's a [ __ ] you moment around me like it's [ __ ] you for  life and in death like it's a grudge with her and someone else I also think that this is why she hid herself so that either the curse will last forever or o or um or yeah I feel like it's almost like a superstitious thing like I want to make sure that this this this beef lasts forever or this problem lasts forever or this curse lasts forever and um you're never going to find it she's holding something page of Pentacles she's holding something I think she's holding something or there's something in there  or there was I mean it could be gone now but there's definitely something that she was like I'm telling you right now reminds you of like Witchcraft and it's like you're never going to find this so you have to deal with this forever or it's lost forever or something either the curses hold on forever until you find it or you know I have this item of yours until you know forever like it's Petty and you want know what's crazy I would be whoever does find her tomb be careful because I swear to you you think  I'm crazy I think there's a curse I do think there's a curse in her tomb you guys are going to think I'm batshit I think there's a curse in her tomb and I do think it's a curse for women I do not think it's a curse for men I think it's a curse for women because even though the saying is no man will find me and people think that means a woman will find her probably but there's a curse there's a curse against women in there I'm telling you right now I really really feel that way it's her way of getting the last  laugh also eight of Swords Knight of Swords reversed and king of Pentacles reversed now I don't know how this is translating you guys you guys are going to drag me but again I'm using modern day terminology so I need like a historian or somebody to translate this so laugh at if you want but I'm being dead serious you know what I'm seeing around her I'm seeing two men that are a feminite around her like freaking Frack around her that look AFF feminite and I don't know what that means but I see two men standing side beside her  that are effeminate that are not they're not her lovers but they're AFF feminite so I don't know what the [ __ ] that means but when I look at them I'm like do you do have gays do you know what I mean but that's a modern interpretation of this so it could just be these people that like the metaphor is just like trying to get me to see that there are two people that support her perhaps they weren't like gay or you know bisexual whatever the [ __ ] they were maybe that's just like what they're trying to get but I'm  seeing two and I'm seeing her really really have a lot of love and respect almost as if they were like her children but they weren't they were they were subservient to her they were like it's like two assistants but they're like they're definitely and you know what's so interesting about you know what's so interesting about these two people is I feel like she was fiercely protective of them and I feel like you need a gay man you need a gay man in that tomb you need a gay man if you're going to find her tomb and  you're a woman you need gay men with you I don't know why maybe it's a part of the curse you need a gay man with you maybe that's a part of the curse I would not go in there alone as a woman you need a gay man I think it's going to take at least one gay man to help find this I do maybe two you know what I'm seeing I'm seeing like a prophecy and I'm seeing her be like if I see I'm see it's almost feels like almost like a prophecy and it's like you need these three people you need this you need that it's weird this  is Witchy as [ __ ] again you're going to drag me for this think I'm crazy and stupid but help me describe the metaphor help me dissect the metaphor remember these are metaphors and they're in you know a terminology that nowadays I I would understand you would understand but we'd have to interpret what I'm seeing through the lens of back then so I can't do that I can only give you modern day [ __ ] you'd have to have someone who knows what the [ __ ] they're talking about like a historian to kind of help  me dis dissect and decipher what I'm seeing of course it's going to sound ridiculous when I say it because I'm relating it to like Taylor Swift but if you understand the metaphor like if you can kind of pull the metaphor like the the the information out of the metaphor you can help me apply this to back then terminology so if anyone's interested in that put in the comments I will read it because I'm being dead serious it's just I can't give you I have to give you modern terminology but I'm telling you there's something a  feminine about these men and they're important to the story like so [ __ ] important and they're also important to this curse I promise you this thing is cursed allegedly so I'm going to leave it at that I don't know you guys are going to clown me I don't care you guys are going to clown me but I don't care I stand behind this reading to be honest I stand behind all my readings yes I do um so good luck peace

A76	https://youtu.be/jkfq3EvhbbM?si=TuwGu3Azl8HuV3LH	Hey everybody it's Doctor Jo, and today I'm going to show you how to relieve vertigo with the Brandt Daroff exercises. So let's get started. So these types of exercises are for the positional vertigo, the BPPV. If you have other types of vertigo, these might not help, but it might be worth a try. Just a disclaimer to let you know that these exercises will probably increase your symptoms and sometimes unfortunately it will make you sick. So keep a bucket beside you just in case. If you have really bad vertigo, there's a possibility that you might throw up, but hopefully it  won't and each time you do it you'll feel a little bit better. So I always tell people when you do these, don't have plans to go anywhere afterwards. You want to be able to kind of just relax and be in a quiet place after you do these. So with that said, you're going to do these exercises 5 on each side. You're going to alternate back and forth, but it's going to be a total of 10 times. So 5 on this side, 5 on this side, and you want to do it twice a day. So the trick to this is when you're going down to one side, you want to turn your head at a 45 degree  angle. You don't want it to be at a 90 degree angle where it's uncomfortable, and you don't want it flat down where you're looking straight ahead, you want it to be kind of in between. So as you go down, you're going to bring up your feet and put your head at about that 45 angle right there. So not here, not here, but right here, and you're going to hold this position for 30 seconds. Now like I said, this position will probably make most people dizzy if they have that BPPV. If you can tolerate it, try and really hold for that 30 seconds because as you  lay here it should start going away. After that 30 seconds, you're going to come back up and stay in this position for 30 seconds as well. And again when you come back up you might be feeling that dizziness your eyes might be jumping just a little bit, but as you sit here it should go away, so just try and try and tough it out if you as you can. And then after that 30 seconds you're going to go to the other side, so coming down bringing your feet up and then putting that head at about that 45 degree  angle. So again not all the way up, not straight forward, but that 45-degree angle, and hold that for 30 seconds. Then after those 30 seconds, come back up. Hopefully if it's still dizzy, it won't be quite as bad this time, and then again you're going to go back and forth until you do five on each side. So it's easy as that, but remember it might make you feel pretty bad, so make sure you don't have anywhere you have to go right afterwards, and make sure you have a bucket just in case, but the more you do it, the better you'll feel. And try  and do this twice a day for at least two weeks, and if it's that BPPV, it really should go away. But even if it goes away within a couple days, I still recommend to go ahead and do it for the whole two weeks just to make sure that that you've got everything realigned in that inner ear. So if you'd like to help support our website and channel, click up here, and don't forget to subscribe down here. And remember, be safe (have that bucket), have fun (no more dizziness), and I hope you feel better soon.

I've really been looking forward to it um it's it's just you're not the right clientele for this type of class maybe you could try the plus-size Zumba class instead but I I thought the founding principal of this gym was all our welcome well it is but um unfortunately the class is full for the day [Music] so she can take my spot wow really are you sure yeah are you sure Vivien  absolutely my back isn't quite right today so I'll just watch fine take a spot in the back all the way in the back please I'm sorry about Alexa she had no right to speak to you that way thanks I thought this gym might be different from the others but uh I guess not no it is the people here are really great and the owner she's amazing she really believes in making this place well welcoming for all Alexa is just a bad apple is all I promise she doesn't speak for everyone [Music] [Applause] here all right keep those hips moving  good job ladies all [Applause] right all right who's ready to AA ready let's go okay excuse me no questions during class uh but I'm I'm just having trouble seeing the steps from back here if you can't keep up then you shouldn't be in this class in the first place but stop messing with everybody's Rhythm the rest of the class didn't pay all of this money to listen to you [Music] wine I'm so sorry just stop stop you're ruining our flow everybody let's just take a break and [Music] reset you're really close here watch my  feet short steps there you go oh wow that is so much easier thank you so much you're welcome you're doing great by the way don't be discouraged you should have seen me in my first class I'm cursed with two left feet wow you you're a really great teacher you know that I wish you were the one teaching this class right now it's funny you say that it's a dream of mine to teach at this gym oh really well why don't you well I actually applied for a job a few months ago but I didn't have enough experience so they hired  Alexa instead all right ladies breaks over let's get back to it keep going you're doing great good Jessica really nice work you call that dancing oh my god look how much you're sweating ladies this is what happens when you eat too many Oreos look at how hard she's breathing you must be joking right now are you even trying to stay on be that isn't helpful Alexa try showing her how to do the steps correctly oh that's enough Vivian I'm teaching this class not you remember she can't get the steps because  she's too big that's the problem not my teaching techniques oh you okay you don't belong in this class no don't cry now I tried to tell you this when you stumbled in here but you didn't want to listen uh what's going on here Julie hi what are you doing here I own the place remember yeah it's just you never come by this class oh I came today to support my daughter your daughter yes my daughter it's her first Zumba class and I wanted it to be special oh Megan her first class I wouldn't have been able to tell cuz  she's just been so great today what's wrong why are you crying was it something Alexa said coming here was a huge mistake all Alexa has done is try to make me feel as unwelcomed as possible I just want to go home no was joking people enough enough do you know why I opened this gym in the first place do you well let me tell you you see I used to be overweight I wanted to lose it to get healthier but every time I signed up for a class someone in the class would make fun of me bully me made me feel even more insecure about  myself than I already did but go home and cry my eyes out after most classes it was [Music] awful so I did the only thing I could think of I started my own gym one that would welcome anyone who came there with open arms regardless of their size or ability I guess what it worked I lost the we and opened 11 more GS so that more women could get healthy without being judged or made to feel ashamed so you see when Megan told me if she wanted to come to one of my gyms I never imagined she' be treated the same  way I was back in those days no person should ever have to go through that you should be ashamed of yourself I didn't mean anything by it I swear we were just playing around St Alexa you are so fired you can't fire me you need me and my students love me uh I think we'll be just fine without you oh yeah who are you going to find that's going to take on my four classes a day actually mom I know a teacher who'd be perfect for the job and unlike Alexa she shares the same values as you huh who viven viven are you kidding me she's  kind patient and really knows what she's doing unlike you Megan that is really nice and all but I didn't help you in order to get something from you I know you did it because you're a good person and you knew I needed the help and that's exactly why you'll be a perfect fit as our new Zumba [Music] instructor wow thank you so much this has been my dream for the longest time well you're welcome and thank you for helping my daughter what are you still doing here leave now this is unbelievable your gym is nothing  without [Music] [Music] me 
S96	https://youtu.be/iqyFHZLI7ME?si=eEWFKQjhDyf_r5kt	hey 42 here if you've been flicking through social media recently tuned into any Netflix documentary or perused a pleora of podcasts you're probably confused about what you should be eating According to some expert influencers you should be a vegetarian pescatarian insect eating meat eating vegan who avoids seed oils sugar acid Dairy and fun confusing isn't it but I want to forget all the fats and hush the hype to answer a really simple question at the bottom of it all that I don't think is talked about enough what are humans  actually meant to eat for going any agenda let's explore our ancestral roots and follow them all the way to the modern day and delve into what the body responds well to and what it doesn't and at the end of this surprising journey I promise you we will have an answer but fair warning you might not like it so then I think the best place to start is at the beginning the very very beginning early hominids first appeared about 7 million years ago we don't know much about our ancestors from this time  but fossils of sahal sahal tropus sahis but fossils of sahelanthropus chadis the earliest hominids have been found exhibiting small teeth with thick enamel suggesting they occasionally ate small amounts of hard food like nuts and seeds but primarily their diet consisted of softer Foods fruits leaves insects and occasionally meat although if they ate meat it would have been small creatures such as mice rats Birds fish and small reptiles the homade diet remained the same for the next few million years  until Lucy came and spoiled it all by saying something stupid stupid like I want to eat chubbas chubbas would have been a difficult eat for earlier species since we hadn't yet discovered cooking to soften them in 1974 in Ethiopia several hundred pieces of fossilized bone were discovered and dated to about 3.2 million years ago she was named Lucy and she's one of the best preserved examples we've ever found of ostralegus a genus of harmonist that existed between 4 to 3 million years ago Lucy filled in a lot of  tionary blanks for us notably she showed a huge Improvement in the structure of the jaw and teeth OST epifagus would have been able to eat far more nuts and seeds than sahal mopus and hard uncooked vegetables like tubis they would have also been able to process tougher slightly larger pieces of meat if they could scavenge it speaking of which we didn't start hunting for meat until 2 million years ago when Homer erectus first erected itself self onto the planet this species was a significant Turning Point Homo  erectus was taller had a larger brain and was more dextrous than its predecessors these traits allowed them to develop more sophisticated tools enabling them to hunt and process meat more efficiently fossil evidence shows clear signs of Butchery on small animal bones dating back to this era suggesting at this time we ate meat with more regularity but the biggest change to our ancestors diet came after we learned to control fire for a long time we thought that this happened about 400,000 years ago but Ash founding caves in South  Africa suggests it was actually about 1.5 million years ago cooking food kills parasites prolonging our lifespans cooked food has to be chewed less so there was a steady decrease in our jaw size after this era the gut also grew smaller because it didn't need to use as much energy to digest food and fibrous root veget vbl were now on the menu more often as were tough and chery lean meats such as [Music] game the effect of increased meat consumption was profound it's believed that the high quality nutrients found in  Meats played a crucial role in the evolution of our larger more complex brains meat is more energy densed than plants and is high in B12 zinc and iron which are all crucial for brain development generally though cooking allows for greater nutrient absorption of all food types leading to a much faster development of the species then things continued pretty much the same for the next million years until about 10,000 years ago when the Advent of Agriculture marked the biggest change in the diet of homo sapiens we  left our nomadic lifestyle of hunting and Gathering behind for one of farming and settling in one place prior to the development of Agriculture the human diet had to be adapted to the environment we found ourselves in populations living near bodies of water would have had a diet richer in fish and seaweed whilst those in forested areas would have eaten more fruits nuts and game but in a post-agricultural world we could now for the first time in history adapt the environment to us within a few short centuries the amount of forest  food in our diets dropped prec iously we began to eat far less nuts seeds wild fruits and game meat in their place was grain more grain than you could shake a sheath of wheat at a grain based diet can support a much larger population per square mile than hunting and foraging so this is when Homo sapiens started spreading across the globe and our numbers grew exponentially but agriculture wasn't necessarily a good thing we were less healthy than ever before early agriculture is lacking in quite a few  important nutrients specifically vitamins A and C which are prevalent in vegetables and fruits and b12 and omega-3 fatty acids which are found in Meat and Fish these elements were all severely lacking in this new grain-based diet which was also a high carbohydrate diet which as we'll discover gives you lots of energy but lacks a nutritional value we had conquered the environment we had made it our slave and as a result we became unhealthy slops skeletal remains from this period showing increase in  dental problems like cavities and gum disease conditions that were rare amongst hunter gatherer populations there was a reduction in average stature and an increase in signs of malnutrition and diseases related to nutritional deficiencies but something else rather interesting happened during this time our genes changed seriously specifically most human cultures but not all rather quickly in the timeline of evolution at least developed lactase persistence a fascinating genetic adaptation that allowed some human population groups to  digest lactose into adulthood something we couldn't easily do before this trait is a direct and rather rapid consequence of the domestication of dairy animals it's a stellar example of how the development of agriculture even in the short space of 10,000 years has etched a permanent Mark into our DNA this tells us that human genetics have flexibility and who knows what new food Trends we will adapt to in the next few thousand years now agriculture may have made us less healthy than ever before but you  may think that this trend was reversed at some point after all with the Advent of The Middle in the 18th century more people were eating a varied agricultural diet than ever before Gone were the days of bread and GRL for breakfast lunch and supper and it was in with the various farmyard Meats farm grown fruits and vegetables and complex carbohydrates nuts seeds and pulses and an increase in preserved Food meant better nutrition throughout the winter too and yes all of this helped we started to regain and  even surpass those standards of nutrition and health that we left behind in our hunter gaver days and in developed Nations life expectancies broke through unprecedented barriers trouble was this only happened in areas of the world that had a middle class and therefore had access to such a varied nutritious diet and then of course there was the Great Plague on the horizon not the black death but something much worse us a plague that once it had seeped its tendil into society it began to rust us away from  our very core the plague of processed [Music] food now I'm not going to rant on about the evils of processed food here because we've all been lectured about it more than we probably care for at this point but one thing is for certain as processed food has proliferated throughout the world obesity has skyrocketed multiple metal IES over the past decades have found a strong link between so-called ultra-processed foods and an increased risk of heart disease stroke and premature death so we've established what we've  been eating for the past 7 million years and how the human diet has shifted during that time but we still haven't answered the most important question what should humans be eating today to answer this I'm going to attack it on two fronts human physiology and nutritional needs so let's start with the physiology consider our digestive track the length and complexity of an animal's gastrointestinal tra are intrinsically linked to its diet herbivorous animals such as cows have long complex digestive systems that  include multiple stomach Chambers or a lengthy colon plant materials like grasses and leaves are hard to break down and cellulose which is found in plants requires prolonged fermentation to efficiently extract the nutrients some hior animals even have to regurgitate their food and Rec consume it or eat their own feces because one pass through their GI track is insufficient herbivores also have to eat constantly through the day to consume enough daily nutrients conversely humans can eat thice twice or once per day or  even once every couple of days and still extract sufficient nutrients the shorter colon of homo sapiens compared to herbivores suggests it has evolved to consume meat although it's not as short as a carnivores which makes sense since we're somewhere in the middle we're omnivores humans also have a very high level of stomach acidity compared to other omnivores and even more so than some carnivores this is an evolutionary byproduct of eating meat since strong stomach acids are necessary for killing  bacteria that can proliferate on meat the human pancreas also produces special enzymes that are proficient at breaking down proteins and fats put all this together and Homo sapiens are of all the omnivores one of the most well adapted for meat consumption the human diet is also imprinted in a really obvious way into our teeth we have molers for grinding and canines for tearing as omnivores this gives us a level of flexibility that is rarely seen in the animal kingdom allowing us to process both tough plants and  meats that's our physiology in a nutshell but what does our body actually need if your body is an engine exactly what mix of fuels does it require to function with maximum power and efficiency well the body's fuel mix can be divided into two categories macronutrients and micronutrients macronutrients are like the petrol for our engine the body needs these continually in reserve to keep running micronutrients on the other hand are like engine oil they lubricate the engine ensuring everything runs  smoothly as for the macronutrients there are three carbohydrates proteins and fats carbohydrates are the body's main energy source proteins and fats can also be used as energy but they're more complex and difficult to break down carbs are easy quick energy that are broken down into glucose in the body which is the primary energy source for your brain and muscles carbs also have a protein sparing effect the body will opt to use carbs for fuel instead of breaking down proteins which could otherwise be used for Vital bodily  functions and to repair tissue but as we all know by now carbs have an ugly side carbs are essential for our energy needs but eat too many and suffer the side effects any carbs that aren't used for energy whether it be intensive exercise or just walking about are stored as glycogen in the liver and muscles the liver stores about 100 gr of glycogen and the muscles 400 G this is all fine because it can be used for energy later on but when the glycogen stores are already full and fur carbs are consumed it is instead  converted into fat and stored around the body as adose tissue which is a fancy word for the wobbly bits also excessive carb intake especially simple carbs like sugar and basically everything tasty causes your blood sugar levels to spike insulin is released to remove this excess glucose from the bloodstream but if this behavior is repeated over a prolonged period you can develop insulin resistance and type two diabetes so the tldr of carb hydrates is this we should be eating them since your body does need them for energy but  eating too many especially crappy carbs leads to diabetes obesity heart disease and that old favorite death then there's proteins the VIN of the macronutrients the favorite Child proteins are the building blocks of life your muscles Bones skin hair and pretty much everything else needs proteins to regenerate your muscles are made up of tiny strands of protein called myofibrils These are torn when you exercise and you need protein in your body to fuse them back together and when you cut yourself collagen the most  abundant protein in your body is used to create a scaffold on which new tissue can grow to close the wound proteins also regulate your immune system they create enzymes prevent blood clots transport and store nutrients maintain your fluid balance and acid levels and in a pinch they can be used for energy when your carbohydrate and fat stores are depleted so to ask if the body needs protein would be like asking if a scone needs cream the answer is yes by the way unless you're completely mental government guidelines in the UK and US  recommend about 55 gam of protein a day or 45 gr for women but Recent research suggests that a weightlifters and the elderly who suffer from muscle loss should all be eating much more protein anyone who participates in regular exercise or does resistance training should be consuming 1.2 to 2 g of protein per kilogram of body weight for most men that's at least 110 G per day but here's the strange thing not all protein is created equally and protein quality is more important than protein quantity for efficient protein symphysis  the process of repairing tissue and building muscle the body needs complete proteins that's proteins that contain all nine of the essential amino acids in roughly equal amounts there's actually a number to objectively measure protein quality the higher the dasas the more of that protein your body actually absorbs and uses higher is better the foods with the highest dasas are all animal-based such as pork chicken beef eggs and way protein which comes from milk so don't be fooled by the protein content of  plant-based foods such as peas oats and soy you may consume 50 gr of PE protein but your body won't be able to use all 50 gr due to those proteins containing imbalanced amino acids whereas 50 g of chicken protein will be fully utilized by the body lastly there's fats often misunderstood and unfairly vilified fats are essential for the absorption of fat soluble vitamins a d e and K they're also crucial for brain health fats come in free flavors saturated unsaturated and trans fats saturated fats found in animal  products and some plant oils were once deemed the bad guys thought to clug arteries and increase risk of heart disease and truth be told the jwel is still out on that one however newer research suggests that the story is a bit more complex your body actually needs saturated fats but the trick is to balance them with unsaturated the so-called good fats mono unsaturated and polyunsaturated fats are found in foods like olive oil avocados nuts and fish they are the champions of good heart health helping to lower bad cholesterol  levels reduce inflammation and they've been linked to a lower risk of heart disease omega-3 fatty acids a typical polyunsaturated fat found abundantly in fatty fish are particularly beneficial for brain function and reduce the risks of depression dementia and arthritis and then there are trans fats the true villains these are mostly artificial fats created in an industrial process that adds hydrogen to liquid vegetable oils to make them more solid trans fats are found in many fried foods baked goods and processed snacks  they're associated with an increased risk of heart disease and like luten should generally be avoided as much as possible dietry guidelines recommend that 20 to 35% of your daily calorie intake should come from fats predominantly unsaturated so the human body needs carbohydrates fats and most of all proteins to function but remember there are the other fuels in the mix micronutrients micronutrients are divided into vitamins and minerals such as iron zinc calcium and potassium vitamins are organic compounds  that are essential for bodily functions such as immune response vitamins a d e and K are all fat soluble and are stored in the body of eaten at least somewhat irregularly whereas the various B vitamins and vitamin C cannot be stored in large amounts and therefore have to be eaten on a regular basis for efficient brain and body development vitamins all play a crucial role and each of them does something for us whether it's vitamin D for bone health or vitamin A for vision and immune support but what does this mean for our  diets in trying to figure out what humans need to eat we should surely be eating the foods that give us a healthy balance of all the vitamins and a quick side note notice I said foods not supplements healthy individuals can get all the vitamins and minerals they need from eating food alone furthermore it's generally recommended to get all your vitamins and min minerals from food rather than supplements unless your doctor has recommended to the contrary anyway let's get back to those vitamins so vitamin A  is found primarily in fish oils and dairy products as well as eggs spinach and kale vitamin D is a similar story look at fatty fish egg yolks mushrooms and red meat vitamin E surprise surprise is also found in fish but it's also present in Almond sunflower seeds and pine nuts Vitamin K is the king of leafy greens you'll find it in pretty much every dark green plant broccoli kale Swiss chard asparagus brussel sprouts Etc vitamin C comes from citrus fruits black currants strawberries and some green vegetables and finally there are  the various B vitamins there are eight of them and they can be mostly found in animal products meat cheese milk eggs Etc however there's one particular vitamin that holds a unique clue in our journey to find out what humans should eat B12 is a really interesting vitamin because it is the only one that can only be found in significant amounts in animal products B12 can be found in high amounts in all types of meat fish eggs and dairy this is because it's uniquely synthesized by bacteria that only live  in the guts of animals there are no plant foods that are significant natural s sources of B12 that presents a bit of a problem for people who wish to pursue a meat-free diet because B12 simply can't be skipped it is absolutely essential to our development and survival as humans B12 is needed for red blood cell formation and a deficiency often leads to anemia B12 is also crucial for brain development and ongoing brain health as well as heart health a lack of B12 has also been linked to an increased risk of  depression and anxiety although these days many non-animal food products are artificially fortified with B12 to alleviate these issues in those with low or no meat diets however B12 is one of the clearest signals we have that from a purely evolutionary point of view without any moral consideration or otherwise that humans should be eating meat and other animal products so then we know what our bodies need and we know what we've been eating for millions of years can we finally now answer that question what  should humans eat well if I absolutely had to give an answer it would probably be this whatever works for you I think it's really important that we educate ourselves on our biological requirements and make sure we cover all our bases with our diets avoiding over consumption of any one food group but the truth is that everyone is different not just in beliefs morals and tastes but physiologically the personalized nutrition project was a large-scale study conducted in Israel in 2015 in which the blood sugar levels of  800 participants were tracked after eating what they discovered is that no one diet fits all everyone's bodies respond differently to the same Foods ice cream may cause one person's blood sugar to spike but the same ice cream could have no significant effect on another individual this is important to note because elevated blood sugar levels have long been linked to weight gain heart disease and diabetes interestingly they also found that how people's blood sugar levels reacted depended largely on the health  of their gut microbiome those with healthy levels of good gut bacteria could better tolerate high sugar foods but that's a topic for another day the personalized nutrition project is just one study within a new and emerging field of science called [Music] Neutrogena why people react differently to different foods and diets it explores how the presence of specific gene mutations in some people affects what they should be optimally eating [Music] neutrogenia genetic variants such as the mtfr mutation which affects f metabolism  and has implications for cardiovascular health and pregnancy they've also found a gene that determines how well or how poorly caffeine works on you it's called cyp1 A2 if caffeine doesn't give you a perk like most other people you probably have the fast metabolizing version of this Gene by analyzing these various genetic markers and many more we've yet to discover neutrogenia aims to personalize nutrition advice moving beyond a one siiz fits-all dietary recommendation to create bespoke diets that cater to  individual genetic profiles just imagine sending off your blood to some Silicon Valley company only to get the results in an app telling you exactly how certain foods affect you personally and offering a DNA specific diet after having said all this I'm not comfortable leaving the answer to what should humans beat on whatever you fancy although it's true to a large extent it feels rather unscientific especially after everything we've learned in this video so if I absolutely had to give an answer just based on my research then I  suppose I'd have to ask the question when were humans at our healthiest if we look at the timeline of our existence when could we pinpoint the epoch of optimal nutrition for humankind to answer this we first need to completely disregard lifespan as a factor average lifespans in developed countries have almost doubled in the past 100 years but that has been driven primarily by medical advancement and a better understanding of General Health not by diet well thankfully for me a huge amount of research has already been put  into answering the question of when was optimal human nutrition and although there is still ongoing debate and probably always will be the overwhelming consensus amongst researchers scientists and dietitians is that we were at our healthiest when we were hunter gatherers also known as the Paleolithic Era which roughly spanned 2.5 million years ago to 10,000 years ago just before the Advent of Agriculture when we basically fued everything up some researchers suggest that as hunter gatherers our diets were the most  in line with our evolutionary adap ations as they ever have been that is to say in every way our body had evolved to desire process and accept foods and nutrients during the Paleolithic Era we were Meeting those goals and we also didn't eat anything at that time that was particularly difficult for our bodies to process because grain and processed foods didn't exist yet our diet is consisted mostly of lean meats fish eggs nuts seeds fruit and vegetables this is why there are so many modern-day proponents of the paleo diet  which Advocates eating those exact things and avoiding modern conveniences such as wheat and any foods with refined sugar such as sweet soft drinks Etc it sounds simple and that's because it is although I don't particularly like the term paleo diet because it's not a diet at all it's just a mode of eating a to that which we've evolved to do so over millions of years and it seems to be working there are early indications that the paleo diet has shown reductions in chronic diseases by those who follow  it but I would argue that there's a slightly healthier diet out there and the lifestyle that better suits our tastes as modern humans which still provides all the benefits of the paleo diet and a little more so ultimately if I had to answer the question what are humans meant to eat this diet would be my answer my final answer and please note this is just my personal opinion that I've derived based on the research I've done ask anyone else and they could answer differently now some of you might have already guessed what I'm about to  say yeah it's the Mediterranean diet yes yes I know you've heard all about it time and time again but it turns out there are a hundred good reasons for that you see the paleo diet may be pretty great in all but humans are ultimately creatures of habit and we're extremely susceptible to Temptation and that's a bit of a problem because the paleo diet is really very limiting namely it cuts out two of modern Humanity's greatest inventions wheat and cheese the paleo diet forbids the consumption of dairy and anything made  from grain like Breads and pastries last time I checked those were all a delicious things because those are post agricultural inventions and they were not eaten by hunter gatherers but the Mediterranean diet has managed to magically fuse the best elements of the Paleo Diet with the wonders of agriculture in a beautiful blend of good food and World leading Health the Mediterranean diet which is primarily the diet of Italy Greece and Spain just like the paleo diet Champions the consumption of Whole Foods in their  natural unadulterated unprocessed State however the Mediterranean diet expands The Culinary palet of paleo with the addition of whole grains legumes and dairy products particularly fermented ones like cheese and yogurt which are great for your good health these additions not only provide a wider variety of flavors and textures but also bring in essential nutrients that might be less abundant in a strict paleo diet for example whole grains and leg fumes are excellent sources of dietary fiber B vitamins and minerals  like iron and magnesium and sourdough bread and dairy products both of which are extremely common in the med but completely excluded from the Paleo are fantastic probiotics which improve the health of your gut microbiome something which is increasingly proving to be one of the pillars of overall good health probably the Hallmark of the Mediterranean diet is its emphasis on healthy fats olive oil and fish are pretty much eaten daily we get monounsaturated fats from olive oil and polyunsaturated fats and omega-3 from  fatty fish these fats are not only heart healthy but also Aid the absorption of fat soluble vitamins enhancing the nutritional value of all of the food consumed furthermore the Mediterraneans famously love their red wine drinking it almost daily red wine is packed with a phenol called Resveratrol which increases good cholesterol levels and has a neuroprotective effect shielding the brain from degeneration but for me the biggest benefit to living by the Mediterranean diet is that it tastes amazing  and it's simply a joy to eat and most of all apart from avoiding processed foods it's pretty much unrestricted I'm a big believer that any restrictive diet we place upon ourselves ultimately degrades our enjoyment of food and makes it harder to stick to said diet and the results speak for themselves as of 202 Italy and Spain are both ranked in the top 10 worldwide for life expectancy and the Italian island of Sardinia is one of only five blue zones in the world regions where people regularly live to over  100 in conclusion there is no one siiz fits-all answer to what should humans eat a diet that includes a variety of Whole Foods is rich in fruits vegetables healthy fats and proteins and is adaptable to individual ual needs and preferences seems to be the closest we can get to a so-called optimal human diet but remember what's optimal for one person might not work for you and ultimately all you can do is inform yourself about how what you eat affects your body and then eat whatever you think will make you happy and healthy so  to wrap things up if I really had to answer the question what are humans meant to eat I would say this the same damn thing we've been eating for thousands if not millions of years and it's my hope that this video has given you a brief overview as to what that might be after all it's worked pretty bloody well for us up to this point so if it ain't broke don't fix it thanks for watching just a quick word to say that I couldn't make these videos without the support

G104	https://youtu.be/y2NadLZijpg?feature=shared	[Music] in today's world it's natural and normal to feel like we should be doing more [Music] but perhaps being present in our lives is enough [Music] you know often our days are full but we're unsatisfied [Music] we're living in a time of extreme self-improvement everywhere we look people are trying to find quick solutions to ameliorate their lives and slow living seems to be another one for the last three years i have been learning what it means to live slow and in the past several months as i've  noticed the term slow living becoming more mainstream i can't help but wonder is slow living yet another trendy self-improvement train to hop onto i feel it's important to recognize that slow living isn't just a trend it's an enduring way of approaching life that goes much deeper than aesthetics [Music] you don't have to live in the rural countryside to live simply and slowly you don't have to garden or farm or be into cottage core or make bread from scratch slow living is so much deeper than that  it's a way of being that brings immense peace and inner fulfillment because when it comes down to it slow living is about essentialism and presence as a collective most of us are walking around this life half asleep even if you're busy even if you're doing or producing things that seem important it's very easy to start chasing the wrong things but living slow helps us live our lives more fully because there is a focus behind it to me slow living resembles intuitive living because when you know yourself and when  you know what you inherently value in your life everything around you just becomes clear i like to think of writers in this way when an author looks back at their career of writing books they don't remember the opening up the box of their newly printed book or reading the reviews as soon as they come out [Music] they remember the process of writing the act of showing up each day to put the words to paper they remember where they were when they wrote it and how they felt when they finished writing each day  i think it's similar to our own lives when we look back on our lives we won't remember the destination we'll remember the journey of living and the sweet mundane of it [Music] all when we do things without being attached to the outcome ideas clarity and solutions have the space to drop in [Music] we live fully by being aware awareness is simply observing the present reality it's noticing yourself listening to and watching this video right now [Music] pausing observing the space between the chattering of your thought  and the stillness in the moment [Music] slow living has taught me a lot about patience and about enjoying where i'm at right now in my life i'm no longer striving or chasing for an outcome or something far out into the future but i'm delighting in the process as it unfolds i love this quote by helen keller she says i long to accomplish a great and noble task but it is my chief duty to accomplish small tasks as if they were great and noble oh i just i love that i have it written down on a post-it note near my desk  but it's so true there's a lot of joy gained from accomplishing each small task from delighting in the process of of taking action in small ways every single day personally i know for me there is no greater joy than taking the small action steps of my day-to-day in my home like getting my favorite sponge and lathering it with my favorite lemon-scented dish soap and washing the dishes by hand or the smell of fresh clean laundry right as i take it out of the washing machine i feel so much joy in taking my fresh  clean laundry out of the washing machine putting it on the balcony with a clothespin and enjoying the sun these are such small things that when we tap into our five senses it really brings us into this present moment slow living is a lifestyle choice that is very different from the mainstream because instead of needing to be seen to be busy productive or successful you just need to enjoy your life [Music] [Music] in a way slow living values privacy and living a private life that is very enjoyable and valuable to you  when living slow know that you don't have to have your whole life mapped out you don't need to have a plan what you do need to know though is what you place priority in what is essential to you what is life giving to you and plan your life around the things that you value most for me and what i've learned with slow living it's that it's very important to discipline our minds to not be so easily distracted by the constant stimulation enjoying the silent moments focusing on one task at a time i often wonder do we find comfort  in the noise are we embarrassed by [Music] silence [Music] living slowly is having purpose and intention behind your daily choices and keeping it consistent because one big choice one big action will not bring you consistent joy life is a marathon not a sprint move like a snail and have the long-standing endurance to keep going at a snail's pace [Music] if the way of life you're currently living doesn't serve you and the life experience that you want to have stop buying into it question everything  you've been taught notice how spiders spend all their days weaving intricate webs only to have them damaged by the wind and then start all over again living slowly is not only about enjoying the process but also about being resilient it's pacing yourself going at your own natural rhythm your own speed and ignoring the speed of everyone and everything around you you have the power to decide how the rest of your life goes when i started living slowly i began living fully [Music] this is what i've learned about the slow  living journey over the past few years take what works for you and enjoy the [Music] ride [Music] [Music] you 
A108	https://youtu.be/u8qEAMsHiRU?si=GXTPz7vWwlP8jDP_	did you know there's an entire underground butt Market where you can go to buy injections for your keester and they're administered by people that aren't actually qualified to be giving them they're not medical professionals and yesterday a mother and daughter Duo got arrested for this they' travel around and give people some injections into their tokus to try and Elevate their ass game to the next level and they would have got away with it too if it wasn't for those meddling medical license required ments you can't really  just go around giving people medical procedures unless you're qualified to do so for the obvious reason of it's dangerous people die from it all the time from botched procedures even something as simple as getting your butt cheeks blasted here with whatever substance they were administering which they're still investigating what they even giving them for all we know they could have been dishing out bbls using Play-Doh in a syringe blasting like hamburger meat into their butt like there's no telling it could have been anything but  anyway they made a public appearance yesterday uh right now they're out on bail but I'll I'll introduce you to goof and goober here real quick consuello Maria delbo made her first appearance in a Harris County court yesterday she faces a felony drug charge and a misdemeanor of practicing medicine without a license dalbo spoke with our news Partners in Houston while out on bond she says her passion is helping people and boosting their confidence believe me Everything I Do I Do It With My Heart and everybody who knows me they know me  sometime I do it because they really need it what a bunch of fish paste what do you mean she's making it sound like she's some kind of saint for doing this as if it's like a required procedure that some people need but just can't afford you and your daughter were just praying on people's insecurities to make a fat payday you were charging thousands of dollars to show up to their residents with a mystery liquid and a syringe that could have just been turkey gravy for all we know no one needs an ass booster  she's trying to frame this like she was doing a good deed or a valuable service you weren't unless there was someone born without butt cheeks and they can't sit down cuz they just slide off the chairs or if they lay down in bed they just squeak off the side or something there's nobody in the world that needs this done look at the mother and daughter in Texas who got arrested for illegally giving people butt injections bootle bbl's oh this is 9 hours ago mother and daughter accused of Performing illegal  butt injections arrested in sting operation in Texas that'll get you every time getting your BBL from wish mother and daughter accused of Performing illegal butt injections without any medical expertise were arrested in Texas Consuelo dalbo 56 and her daughter Isabella dalbo 18 have been charged with practicing medicine without a license a Mis how is that only a misdemeanor like that is that should be so much more severe well I know a misdemeanor can be pretty severe though I mean that's that's big stuff  practicing medicine without a license like come on come on people die from this court documents revealed a women went to a home to perform the butt injections on a customer who was actually an undercover peace officer they plan to charge 6,000 for the service are they calling them peace officers now instead of police is this like some kind of Rebrand or something why are they calling him a piece officer that's some Hunger Game the woman the women apparently were not even sure what was in the injectables described as an unlabeled  brown liquid a motion for bail written by Harris County District's Attorney office said this fundamentally demonstrates how remarkably dangerous these acts were Consuelo Dalo allegedly provided a Zan xanx Jesus Christ provided his Annex to the prospective customer for the purpose of relaxing her before the injections began the women were ultimately arrested separately in the sting authorities also confiscated bags containing the illegal injectables and medical equipment they were accused of traveling across the country to give  clients these illegal injections the investigation into the pair was conducted by Houston Police Department's major offenders division Food Drug Administration agents what a long title and Homeland Security they're prohibited from practicing medicine without a license as I think anyone in the world would be in 2021 police said a mother and daughter Duo were charged with a murder in California after they performed a botched butt injection that resulted in the October 2019 death of 26-year-old Karissa Raj Paul police said  that the mother and daughter had no medical certification it was believed neither had any type of training the jury found them guilty of involuntary manslaughter last month also in 2021 a Dallas woman was sentenced to 5 years in prison for causing a nightclub dancer's death by performing an illegal butt injection on her in Missouri in 2015 bro these butt injections get you every time that's like a speedrun to meet your maker the butt has a lot of nerves and some important veins if I remember correctly so if it's performed badly  like this can happen this can H this can happen with any kind of procedure though from someone that's not actually licensed there was a Instagram model actually she might have just been like a full-blown big model I can't remember who died after a botched knee surgery that was supposed to like remove a little like what was it a little cartilage around her knee cuz she didn't like the way her knees looked so this can just happen anywhere if you're being tended to by a less than qualified [Music]  professional that's what it was removing fat from her knee that's what it was and it was a Brazilian influencer who suffered cardiac arrest after lipos suction on her knee went wrong which is a crazy procedure to get in the first place removing some fat from your knee you kidding me there was also that billionaire who died after getting a penis injection to make his dick bigger why a billionaire died during penis enlargement oh yeah this was in 2019 it was a Diamond Trading billionaire his name was Ehud R  Leno are you kidding me I already turned my ad block off for you now you're not going to let me read the article unless I sign up for this you've got some nerve man it's incredible it the gall the app the state of the goddamn internet and you're going to autoplay an ad for me God Jesus what a joke a wealthy Belgian Diamond dealer has died of cardiac arrest following a cosmetic surgery in a Parisian Clinic to enlarge his sex penoplasty is a surgical technique that dates back to 1990 increasingly more  popular has become A5 billion Market what the go- go gadget extendo dick I just didn't think these be popular I actually didn't even know these existed until pretty recently I thought that was one of those things that you just had to suck up I knew they had some procedures for micro penises but I didn't think you could really do one on like a normal just small one the Belgian Israeli Diamond dealer living in the US traveled to Paris to have the operation and succumbed to it he checked into the clinic on the second of March to enlarge  his sex said one of the medical personnel the operation turned bad and the client had a cardiac arrest the doctors could not save his life well yeah I mean they're

J113	https://youtu.be/A_yHpO7CyX0?si=HHCE6jzhK3CbYCSe	Everybody loves being around Sarah. She's everybody's best friend. She loves kids. She really does. She has an awesome education. She's a bright girl. But as soon she has that bottle in her hand, that's when the worst side of Sarah comes out. SARAH: First drink is just like, you know, a relief, like, I have alcohol now, like, the rest of the day is fine. If I just want to get, like, a good buzz going and feel good for the whole day, I'll stick to beer. Like, if I'm drunk enough tomorrow, [bleep] yeah.  We're coming here and we're doing karaoke. SARAH: But if I actually want to not remember my night, then I'll go vodka. That's not water, by the way. [chuckles] Yeah, kind of. But, then again, I bought a beer so it kind of evens it out. [ominous music] KOLE: She doesn't really get buzzed, it seems. It's like, right when she's buzzed she immediately gets drunk. Can you help me? Like, I just can't-- OK. This is not working out, like, at all. It's like, she's fine, and then all of a sudden she's completely out of her mind.  Yeah, we were gonna [bleep] drive there, and now Sarah's too [bleep]. Nothing new. SONIA: She's put so much toxins into her body that her body won't last much longer. SARAH: My head hurts all the time. My stomach hurts all the [bleep] time. And until I have a drink, that's when I feel normal. Eventually, something-- I mean, something really bad is gonna happen. You know what I mean? It's not gonna-- you can only get lucky for so long. SONIA: No alcohol tonight. Mom, all I [bleep] want is a bottle of vodka.  SONIA: If you just stop thinking about it and just relax, you're not going to think about it. BRIAN: She basically thinks her body runs off alcohol. She thinks she'll die tomorrow if she doesn't get that next drink. I need it. Please? SONIA: You've got some-- a lot of something in your system. Mom, please. [crying] VICKI: I'm afraid of what'll happen if she keeps drinking. She will die. [hopeful music] LEN: I remember at the hospital, when I held her for the first time, I made her a promise that I  would never let anything hurt her or she would never go without. I remember just running around the house playing with her. Sarah was really good until about high school. [ominous music] Sarah has always been very self-conscious about herself. SARAH: Like, I've always had like an issue with, like, self esteem, self confidence. I feel like every-- every female can go see that. But, for me, I think I'm just, like, I'm way more strict on myself. When she was at school one day, one of the boys had called her fat.  That's when she decided that she was going to do something about it. SARAH: That's when I kind of started, like, watching what I was eating, you know, counting calories. And I went, like, really overboard. Sarah wants to be perfect. And I think Sarah feels like she's not. Things changed for her. She did really well. SARAH: I set goals. And I always did my homework and made sure I was doing good. She was 0.5% away from the honor roll. Yeah. Sarah was-- Sarah was good. Sarah wanted to go. She wanted to experience the world.  A couple of days into her trip was the tsunami and the earthquake that-- that rocked the world. [ominous music] We felt the earthquake and everything and, like, the aftershocks. We were kind of bummed out because our trip got cut short. She was there. She was very angry she had to come home. And when she came home and seen why, she felt guilty for feeling angry. She felt very bad for the people over there. For some reason, Sarah was singled out to be the child that they showed all over Canada. It was Sarah's picture that was on all of the newspapers,  on all of the TVs. When she started watching the newscasts, she felt a very deep sense of guilt. It was weird and overwhelming. My anxiety got intensified. SONIA: Sarah went into her bedroom. For about three weeks, all she did was go to school and come home to her bedroom, barely ate. She barely spoke to us at all. And then we find out later on that's when she was drinking. She was hiding alcohol in her room every night. We thought she was drinking lots of water. It was straight vodka in the water bottles.  SARAH: So it just kind of started as, like, a relaxer for me. My brain, my body-- makes me feel calm, normal. I got to a point where I couldn't even walk in my school anymore and just go to class without having a drink. BRIAN: When she moved up to Kingston, that's when we all noticed she had a pretty big problem. I can remember drinking, like, you know, full bottles of wine before class. Literally every time I would drink I'd black out. She's called me in the middle of the night because she's been completely annihilated  and not known where she was. BRIAN: I visited her twice, maybe three times. Sarah drank a whole 26'er. She'd puke. She'd drink more. She'd repeat, repeat. I got calls 3 o'clock in the morning, you know, the cops just gone and got her. She's at the hospital. LEN: I started noticing the money missing. I found many of 40-ouncers, 26-ers, Mickeys. My dad kept telling her over and over again, you know, if you bring any more alcohol into the house you're getting kicked out. And as soon as he found out she was drunk he said, all right,  enough's enough. He got her to pack up a backpack, throw a coat on, actually kicked her out, said, you have to get going. LEN: We can't function as a family with Sarah, you know, fighting this battle. You know, I'm not giving her any money. I'm not giving her a place to stay. You know, I cut all ties. My dad and my brother don't really talk to me. So, you know, they completely don't trust me anymore just 'cause I have lied over so much. BRIAN: My mom is just so wrapped around Sarah, she's believing every word that she says.  You know what I mean? [chuckles] She's always the one to give in. My sister knows that. Can you run in and please-- please-- Have you drank anything today? No. Why don't you try to go just today without it? OK, seriously. If-- if I go in, it's just to get the edge off, just so you're not feeling-- because you're not feeling good? - Yeah. And I'll save it for-- some for tomorrow. You swear it? Yes. You're not gonna get drunk? Nope. Do you promise it's gonna last you a couple of days? Yup. I promise.  This addiction, your addiction, has consumed my life. [somber music] If you do not accept this help, I will have no choice but support your dad and your brother in their decisions to not support your addictions any longer. And as much as that kills me to say, I mean it. I have to save myself. That's a painful thing for a mom to say. Well, I see that in supporting it I'm enabling her. And I can't do that anymore because I'm killing her. When you're sober, you're an amazing person to be with. You're funny, outgoing, energetic,  and you're such a smart girl. When you're drinking, you're careless and you cut yourself out from us. I have seen things that no younger brother should have ever seen. Sarah, today you will have an opportunity of your lifetime. And the reason I say your lifetime is because I believe this is your last chance at life. So it's my job to ask you, are you ready to accept help today, Sarah. Yeah, I'll go. [hopeful music] - What was that? - I'll go. I'll go. I'll go. SONIA: [crying] Look at your family.  Good choice. You'll go. You'll get healthy there. You'll get the tools that you need in order to recover. I'm so proud of you. SARAH: I didn't think it was possible for me to actually be capable of living a sober, healthy life. Without the alcohol, I'm a pretty independent person. I'm creative. I found I love writing. It's just amazing. I'm just looking forward to my life, 'cause I got my whole life ahead of me now. [music playing] (SINGING) Veins swell. You know me, Ellen, enough to tell. 
A117	https://youtu.be/0-vBarJrrOk?si=0B2pdZ9FZC2plei4	all right what's up everybody it's meredith sherwood with spell training and i'm super excited to show you a seven minute at-home full body toning workout we're gonna go through the warm-up the workout and the flow down so let's get to it [Music] [Applause] [Music] all right here we go so the first thing we're going to start with is a warm-up i'm actually going to go do this workout and the warm-up together so that you can see go through the warm-up go through the workout go through the flow down all  the exercises so first thing we're doing is good mornings we're going to do five of those we're going to start to do those now chest up shoulders back hands up come back between your legs and as you come up press your hips forward so i always say zip your rib cage i actually want you to release your rib cage here and then come down so you might hear a little bit of wind you might hear a plane in the background kind of just the way it goes good let's go two more one big breath really press your hips  down and back and last one two next thing we're going is called a bow body so you're gonna be overlapping your hands you just squeeze your ears and you're going to be reaching from side to side it's going to do five each side a little bit of bend in the knee three four five and let's go one more and then just releasing out good and then just drop those arms down right into a wide squat so nice and wide almost like a suma squat we're just doing five of these chest up shoulders back and we're just squatting and then  coming back so if you have knee problems you can go about halfway here you can go halfway but i really want you to press through your heel so sit down and come up sit down and come up so two more last one and then press next warm-up exercise is our tyi so we're going to go five from each position down to a t for five then from a t to a y for five and then from a y to an i for five really great for your shoulders and also your core make sure that you're really sitting back into those hips so you don't feel like you're opening up  the rib cage or slouch forward so thumbs up we're going five here so one pull the rib cage in three four five then stay here you're going one two three four five then from that y one two three four five right into hip opens so you're just releasing that hip up and open so this is one of the best warm-up exercises because it not only gets your core it actually gets your lower back and your butt so you want to make sure these are nice and warm ducks when you're doing some lower body exercises today  for really breathe up and over five six really pull up that knee seven eight nine and last one ten shake it out so that was your warm up super quick now let's walk through all the exercises then we're going to get into the workout together and go right into that flow down so a full body workout here first exercise is a squat punch chest up shoulders back meet down as you come up you're going to be rotating so that's your squat punch second one is a belt a delta a belt bent over sorry this is what happens when you  don't sleep with kids is that you just mix up your words you're going to do a bent over delta so that means chest up shoulders back pressing your hips back and then reaching why it's called a delta is because we're making that triangle with your arms so you're just pulling back we're doing these for 30 seconds then we're going to be doing a knee hover so that's almost like a a beast we call like a beast or bear position so on all fours and you're just going to press up onto your toes and you're really just  hovering your knees if this is too hard what i want you to do is make sure that your fingers are nice and spread and when you do these you just go up for five seconds and then come down up for five seconds and then come down so i want to make sure that everybody can do these so don't force yourself to be in a bad posture when you're actually doing these next is a boxer bounce so a little bit more of just like an active recovery just bouncing back and forth a little bit of low impact cardio if this hurts you you can just step side to  side this is totally fine too what i want you to do is just stay active when you're doing this then we're on the ground for a superman swimmer so on your stomach what you do is lift your left arm and your right leg so you're swimming here left arm right leg right arm left leg really connecting your fingertips to your toes then we're hopping up into a squat hold or probably what you've seen as a chair pose so you're sitting and just holding here really pressing back into your heels if you come forward  you're gonna get knee pain so if this is too much for you just go half squat i really want you to focus on your heels it's the biggest thing please press your heels because if you don't you're going to lean forward you might fall in i might fall in the pool so that's not good next we're going angel pumps chest up shoulders back pumping those arms then we are going a rotating knee to chest so on your back there's a lot of up down but that's a good thing because i want you guys to get your heart rate up and  just transitioning exercises so just a rotating knee to chest so this is the first motion the second motion is just pulling your legs apart and then pulling them open so rotating and then keeping that core nice and tight open close we're really working on those legs to nice get them nice and sculpted then we are going a knee kick back so same positioning i'll switch here so you guys can see on all fours straightening one leg and just coming straight up keeping your chest over your hands and then same thing on the other side  all these exercises are for 30 seconds so we'll break this one up into 15 seconds then we're going to go into a flow down so i actually want to walk you through that so we can go from the workout straight into the cool down okay so the first thing that we're gonna be doing even though you might think it's still part of the workout is jumping jacks so you're doing five jumping jacks hey or you can do step jacks right you can do step jacks here same thing then we're going right into a predator jack so predator jack's a little bit  more difficult it's like a squat jump but you're opening your arm so starting with your feet just a little bit wider than shoulder width and you're going to jump and open your arms and come down almost to a sumo squat so from here and jumping down this is too difficult what i want you to do is step step and then open step step so a little bit more intensive i still want you to move through this flow down on the ground for a plank around the world so into your plank position you're doing is rotating  up and over your arms if this is too difficult drop your knees down and do the same thing your butt can come up a little bit and then you're rotating forward so you really if you're on your knees pull your belly button in towards your spine when you pull back because that's what's really going to work on those deeper core muscles that act as like a girdle last exercise is a reverse push-up so in your push-up position you're going to go down and back and not touch your knees to the ground so down and back  if this is too difficult what i want you to do is start on all fours and just push down and back into a child's pose you're gonna be getting the same movement pattern so we just walked through not only the workout but also the flow down so let's go ahead do all this together remember 30 seconds on and transitioning from each exercise maybe 10 to 15 seconds so first one we are starting with is that squat punch follow me now going straight through the workout into the flow down a little bit longer one so get your water in 30  seconds and go so down and punch and punch so really think about being very consistent when you're doing these exercises if you need to slow down that's totally fine press through the heels good breathe into the nose out through the mouth keep that chin up good good work here press and last one's always the best one straight into that bent over delta chest up shoulders back ready and press back and pull and pull notice how my toes are coming up and i want you to match my speed as best as you can here  and i'll walk you through it so pull the belly button in towards the spine squeeze your shoulder blades as if you have a pencil that you're squeezing and pull so that right there is going to give you a lot of squeeze so down pull and pull good three two one on the ground for your knee hover this is also 30 seconds so we're gonna go bang through this real quick ready and press up so we're going 30 seconds here and holding so keep those hands underneath your shoulders big breath hold this here knees stay off the ground okay  big breath so your quads remain remember if you need to come down take a breath come up hold this come down take a breath and come up really really focus on keeping those quads tight four three two and hop up boxer bounce so keep it nice and active we just had a bunch of exercise let's get a little bit of active recovery take a big breath in we're nice and sweaty i don't want you to pause this when you get all the way through because we're going on the ground next into our superman swimmers big breath here  kind of like a little bit of a dance around alright keep loose five four three two and down on the ground superman swimmers so remember on your stomach and lifting opposite arm opposite leg really want that connection and if this is too easy for you what you can do is lift everything up as if you're swimming a little bit harder here right if not opposite arm opposite leg just focus on being as consistent as you possibly can good three two one always the best one take a big breath here just for a second  coming up pressing back straight into your squat hold ready three two one and sit and hold big breath into your nose out through your mouth now remember you're just on the ground probably with your head down if you feel light-headed stand up shake it out take a breath and sit right back down good breath here focus on pressing through your heels keeping your toes up off the ground three two one right away into angel pumps so little to no rest big breath just because we're doing arms don't want you forget about your legs  and core so what am i saying here a little bit wider than shoulder width press your heels in and then drive your knees together okay i'm not actually putting my knees together but i'm firing my inner thighs i'm pressing my feet together good big breath pulling the core everything's a core workout with me remember three two one and on the ground and i want you to stick with me here okay i want you to listen to my voice as i rotate through each of these exercises hands behind the head rotate one two  three four knees together open close one two three four open close if that's too hard i want you put your feet on the ground now when you open and close like a butterfly okay still really great for the butt two three four knees up open pull them together close good three two one always last one's best one pull open closed rotate right over and we're going 15 seconds on each side here targeting your butt chest up hands straight under your shoulders and then lift so i want you stay as even as possible  so you don't want to be leaning right 15 seconds here i want you to flex your foot backwards for me that means try to point your toe down not out right and switch sides and up so you're really focusing on that lower back in that butt here taking that big breath good work we're gonna go right into our jumping jacks as our cooldown okay so from here jumping up five jumping jacks starting in three two one one two three four five take a big breath predator jacks ready five of these one two you can always do the step outs  three four five straight down to plank around the world so on your elbows here and just rotating one two going five each direction three four five and then switch one two three four five take a big breath push back reverse push up last five ready one two three four five and then just sit down into this child's pose because that's the workout we went through the warm-up we did the entire workout did all the flow down which you might have thought was really hard but that was your seven minute at home backyard hit  workout i know you guys are gonna love it and all the

G123	https://www.youtube.com/live/rwGmPde_U70?si=uqNMyMQL3bzWXuw-	to be back today we are talking about inner work hacks that have massively massively Quantum leaped my life where this idea came from is I've been doing a little bit of traveling this past week and every time I travel alone I have time to be so present and there's things that I've noticed that I've done over the last two years that when I look back and think when I wasn't doing these things how different my life was and I want to share with you what these inner work hacks are so I've got about seven  that I'm going to share welcome in ladies I'm so happy to be with you happy Friday so going into number one also it feels so different having my hair straight every time I straighten it people are like this is a different person it feels so fun to play around with I just got my hair done yesterday finally got a trim it's been six months since I cut it I got a trim I got a keratin treatment it just feels so good so luxurious hi gorgeous hi Queen hey ladies okay let's go ahead and get started so hack number one that is  massively Quantum Leap to my life is paying for peace paying for peace I have so many examples of this one example that really really stood out to me so this actually happened at the Hawaii Retreat back in February and what happened was we so my team and I which is my best friends and my mom and my retreat planner we plan to stay in Hawaii after the retreat to just relax and you know talk about it and to hang out and what happened is we found this beautiful hotel and I told my girlfriends and my mom that I want some  time alone so I'm going to stay in Hawaii after after even they leave so I was going to stay in Hawaii for a long time the day comes where they are about to leave and I just get this feeling in my body that I'm ready to go home and I'm thinking this is so strange I booked extra Hotel an extra long flight so that I could stay in the beautiful island of Hawaii I thought I'm going to want some time to film and just go and explore however when that time came I think it was maybe a Wednesday morning I was ready to go home I have  never experienced something like this before so what happened is I told my girlfriends and I told my mom I said I don't know what to do the room charge is non-refundable the room was like $500 a night I would have to change my ticket and I said you know what either way I've decided that I'm going to go home tomorrow rather than the day that I planned so when I made this decision actually before I even made this decision let me back up I called the hotel and I said is there any way that I can cancel a room I already know that I  paid in advance they said no we're sorry this is not possible so I said okay when I decided I'm going home early there was it wasn't anxiety but it just felt like I'm done in Hawaii everything that I was meant to do here I'm done I'm ready to go home ready to get back to work ready to just be in my uh High vibrational space when I made that decision I went back down to the hotel desk and I asked them I said look I really would like to be back home is there anything that we can do to refund the nights that I won't  be here and they said let's see what we can do they were able to work something out they were able to refund the nights that I wasn't staying then I called the airplane or the airline and I was talking to someone from Hawaiian Airlines and I said look I have to change my flight I'm going to be back uh tomorrow instead what does it cost to change it and they told me the price the price to change it was like the cost of another ticket I was thinking what in the world why is this so much but I said  you know what the cost of my piece is worth this price and that is where this subtle hack number one comes from the peace that I felt being able to go home on the day that I wanted I can't even describe it because as soon as I came back all these Divine Whispers for what I wanted to do with my business came I don't feel that if I was in Hawaii they would have came yes Hawaii was beautiful but it wasn't where I was supposed to be I lived up on the vacation I had fun there but I something was just calling  me be back home and also I had shared this with you girls in the Hawaii Vlog I loved the big island of I liked the big island of Hawaii I didn't love it so coming from Dubai that was my last solo trip to Hawaii it's like night and day difference I just wanted to be in Dubai I thought Hawaii it's fun it's cute but I'm just ready to be in a new place okay so another example that I have for you so this happened with I don't even remember who I was with but it happened in Los Angeles and what happened was we  were getting groceries together and when we were when it comes time to bag up the groceries we're in the self checkout area the cost of the bag we were both not from La so when we were there it said the cost of the bag is 10 cents okay I'm from Las Vegas grocery bags don't cost money we were like what why why do you have to pay to use a grocery bag it was just so strange to us however we had a lot of stuff that we were carrying and what they said was don't let's not use a bag it costs money I turned to them and I said I will  pay for the bag I don't want to have to carry this and struggle to walk to the car the cost of the bag is worth the price of my piece example number two the cost of the bag is 10 cents so things with that if you really break it down I don't want to go into the scarcity I'm not available to go into scarcity I've done way too much inner work to get out of that we've done way too much inner work as a glow girl Community to get out of that so being scared or having that idea of I can either pay 10 cents or I  can struggle possibly drop some items have to go and pay for them again which one do I want to do I'm going to choose the path of Peace where my nervous system is rested where I know I can walk to the car in peace yeah I paid 10 cents but it was an investment it's not an expense so all these costs I started looking at them as Investments we talk about this in the Divine and aligned course course I told the girls from now on we don't say the words expensive we don't say that that costs too much it's  an investment in you these Investments level up your vibration and massively Quantum Leap you so here's an example let's say that when I was in Hawaii let's say that I decided to stay let's say you know what no my piece is not worth paying to change the flight it's not worth going down and asking if I can get the room refunded if I had stuck on that route the ideas for new course say as soon as I came back from Hawaii I think did we launch the gold vault oh my gosh I don't even remember time just flies together  because there's so many Quantum leaps I'm pretty sure that the gold vault which is my money it is my highest vibration Quantum leaping course that course came immediately after the Hawaii Retreat when I was back home if I stayed I would not have made the Quantum Leap we would not have made the Quantum Leap just in the gold vault alone that's the one course where I've seen immediate changes in the girls like buying their dream cars dropping their jobs starting their businesses I've never seen changes  happen this quick can you imagine that I stayed and said no the price of my piece is not worth it it's not worth all the changes for these women's lives another example of this so um okay this one my family my friends past partners they would always get on me about this but I did not care for me it was so worth it going on vacation and traveling paying for a checked bag I cannot stand trying to squeeze all those shampoo bottles into the uh travel siiz carriers I cannot stand looking at my liquids hm is  this less than 3.4 o that to me disrupts my piece so much more than paying the $30 to have a checked bag and just scooping All My Hair Skin Care makeup products into the luggage without having to worry about what do I need to leave behind what do I have to let go of so that's another example that has massively Quantum leaped me the days that I would have a carry-on and not use a checked bag I would spend hours every night transferring um items to new bottles when I would come back cleaning out those travel siiz tubes so that cost  me so much more because an hour of my time is literally worth thousands of dollars now so when you make these small changes and you say no my time is valuable no I'm going to invest in my piece I'm willing to pay for my piece guess what happens you Quantum Leap because now your energy is peaceful it is refreshed and you have the energy to create when you create that is where the gold sits your gold meaning your wealth your relationships your ideas your gold sits when you are peaceful when you are  rested that is why feminine energy makes so much or not even makes but attracts so much money it's just because she's rested she's in this High vibration money loves her so okay this another example finally caught my big sister I've never had live Oh Linda girl you made my day thank you okay let's see uh okay I have some more examples but I want to move to the next subtle hack so subtle hack number one is paying for peace investing in peace that has massively Quantum leaped my life let me check the chat then we'll move to the  next one I'm the same I need all my items yeah I cannot stand it so I actually did just use a carry-on bag because I went to uh visit my grandma in Washington DC I am so sorry girls I feel like I've been MIA this past week I am moving uh so soon to Dubai and I'm trying to squeeze in so many things like this move has been push back because there's things that I just need to do and last week I just went silent like I feel like I went silent on Instagram except for one day I posted everything I'm so sorry that emails are delayed  there's been a lot of questions about the retreat my team is getting back as soon as possible too uh but I just really needed to be present with my family I don't know when the next time I'll see my grandmother in this health that she has so I really just wanted to be present with my family this past week and take advantage of that but I'm back home just packing up for divine now uh also for the retreat okay so I swear whenever I'm getting massages this is another thing paying for peace Quantum leaps you every single time I  get a massage I get this Divine whisper for for a course to make for an idea to do for my business for a new Retreat yesterday I was getting my hair done oh I felt so good to do I get my hair done every six months this is a keratin treatment and a trim I think this the longest my hair has ever been girls isn't this crazy when she uh showed it to me straight I was like that is not my hair there's no way I'll show you the back so yesterday we're doing um the keratin treatment and I get the first Divine whisper for what to teach at the  Dubai Retreat it was just such a magical moment I tell her I'm like Q that's her name I'm like I'm so sorry I need to pull up my phone and write this down right now she's like what is it oh my gosh this is so cool it's something to so the name of this Retreat is royalty and riches there's something to do with hair that she said and I said oh my gosh we're going to talk about this this happened for the Hawaii Retreat and when I got that first Divine whisper everything for the Retreat came after that so I'm so excited to see you girls  at royalty and riches that's happening this summer also I made the price back to the pre-sale price a lot of you ladies emailed me that you need to get passports need to talk to husbands I totally understand that so I'm going to keep the original price that I had and you take your time joining there half the spots are gone so as soon as that last spot is taken I cannot open anymore just based off of the activities that we're doing so pay for peace okay yes so getting massages getting your hair done  literally paying for peace Quantum leaps you because now all these ideas the gold just pours out of you yes royalty and riches oh my gosh I cannot wait to have you ladies some of you ladies that were at the Hawaii Retreat are coming so I can't wait to see you again thank you Olivia uh okay how did I learn about Quantum leaping it's a mix of my own experiences just being observant of my own life my own inner work and also studying quantum physics itself so studying Neuroscience studying quantum physics podcasts there's books there's  YouTube videos I really love Dr Joe despenza you girls know I love him so much so I've learned about Quantum leaping from such a mix okay what does Quantum leaping feel like okay if there's any in the gold vault please go ahead and type in the chat because you girls say it so perfectly in there this is what the girls describe it as so the gold VA is my course on money but it's actually become more of a course on quantum physics and Quantum leaping it feels like magic it feels like time is speeding up and how you will know if you  have Quantum leaped is all of a sudden what you had on your vision board your holding in your hand so for example holding let me actually pull this out okay so uh last year I was thinking I cannot wait to have my dream car like that'll be so cool this January I got it this is the Quantum Leap because uh about two years ago oh as I dropped my purse about two years ago I was so broke so struggling when I would tell people that I want to drive the G wagon that that's my dream car they would laugh they would  say yeah maybe when you're 40 I'm 24 right now I'm holding the keys to it it's downstairs in the garage 2 years later why is that it's because of quantum leaping it's because I started doing these hacks that we're talking about paying and investing in my piece which has allowed the gold to flourish gold meaning the ideas and the creativity that has poured out when you're Quantum leaping time does not move linear time moves all over the place and it feels like you pull Dimensions that you thought were very  far away pull that reality towards you right now that's how it feels what was your biggest dearest Quantum Leap moment was it the car oh that did feel like a big one however I don't think it was the biggest the biggest Quantum Leap was actually there's two that are tied the first one was making six figures in a month that blew my mind never ever ever did I think think that was possible I think the second uh and that happened September 2023 the second biggest Quantum Leap was planning the Hawaii Retreat okay so I I'll actually  tell the story because it's a perfect example of quantum leaping after I I did my first solo trip to Dubai in October of 2023 when I came back the next month it was my birthday month good things always happen during the birthday months I decided I want to host a retreat I want all of us girls in the glow girl Community together on a beautiful tropical island Bond over Sisterhood deep in our work activations and I want to teach in person that was my dream that I had and I thought this is kind of strange I've never seen  someone go to somewhere very beautiful and tropical and have this playful like Sisterhood uh type of experience and then I thought Alexis why don't you just create that so what I did is I decided okay we're doing a retreat in February February I just picked that mon cuz it just felt good after that I went on Tik Tok I found a woman that seems like a really really great Retreat planner I reached out to her hired her and we brought it to life three months later when we met I said I want to do this  retreat in February she goes um usually it takes 6 months to plan a retreat I said okay how quick can we get this one done and she goes well it's just about are you going to be able to have enough people there are we going to be able to find the Villa it ended up being perfect it was the most beautiful Retreat I have the Vlog posted if you girls haven't seen it yet and afterward she goes Alexis I've never done this in my life before where's the next one going to be and I said Dubai so there's just so many Quantum  leaps like that that was probably my favorite because it just happened in a day I decided we're doing a retreat and then brought it to life three months later so I'm in love with this information thank you so much thank you Olivia yes okay let's move on to the next Point um oh wait let me see okay I'll answer questions about the courses in just a little bit I want to give you girls these tips because I am on a little bit of a tight schedule today okay this one is funny all of these tips have nothing to do with each  other so just be prepared they're a little bit random okay tip number two subtle hack that has massively Quantum leaped my life is rewiring my brain I point to my heart that was so strange I feel like the brain is the heart though I rewired my brain to change my type what does that mean here's an example my type used to be the bad boy if you girls are in my seductively Savage course you know I shared some pretty rough experiences in there with you my type used to be the bad boy the one that would break hearts that was  wounded masculine because I was the reciprocal of it I was is the Wounded feminine energy my inner work has changed that and here's a subtle hack that I've done when I see a man that has a red flag or that throws my intuition off I immediately gross myself out and I know that that sounds harsh but you have to be Savage because your future daughters are on the line and what happens if you marry a man that is not good for you your daughter will unconsciously go out and seek a man just like that to be her future husband so I  when I say grossed out take it with a grain of salt not the man is gross but the idea of matching with that type of energy grosses me out here's an example there was this is when I first first realized it and I thought oh okay Alexis all these subtle changes of you changing your mind rewiring your brain has led to here I used to be so attracted to guys who were very very physically attractive and they would show it on social media what I mean is they had lots of pictures ofs maybe they had pictures of their shirt  off they um just had a lot of selfies things like that so there was this time it's actually happened uh recently more in my inner work Journey where there was a guy that had reached out to me on Instagram and he was really handsome just based off his profile picture and he was famous I went to go and look at his profile it's all pictures of himself smiling with the camera posing against a Lamborghini all this stuff all him it's like hundreds of pictures of just him in my mind I'm like I'm so repelled by this energy what  I had to do is make my body feel like it's physically sick and I had to say to my mind this is how you rewire your brain it's so much simpler than what we think I had to say to my mind I am so unattracted to this I am so unattracted to Men Who Flex to men who want to just boost their ego by posting pictures and receiving validation I'm so unattracted to men who need the validation from women and from social media exited out of his profile never went back so things like this where I physically rewired my brain when I used  to say oh my gosh he's so attractive let's see where this could go nope because every single man that I have interacted with that has posted a lot of pictures of himself needs to have his ego validated and I'm not available to do that you can hire a therapist to do that I am only available for a healthy masculine man who has learned to work with his ego who leads with his soul who leads with his healthy masculine energy and is already whole and complete on his own because if he needs his ego to be  fed and posting tons of pictures of himself mostly for men if he needs that what happens when we get together his ego is not going to be fed by me his ego needs to be fed by himself and if even if I'm feeding his ego baby you're so handsome posting pictures of him I've been in relationships like this it's never enough they need validation froms do not get with a man who has not given validation to himself he will constantly seek it from other sources this is why a lot of men are Unfaithful they need to be valid validated and it's  never enough that's why they say I'll never cheat again have they validated thems thankfully I've not experienced cheating at least that I know of I've had friends who were cheated on and it is devastating to them every single man has this in common his ego needs to be validated so what I do is I gross myself out turn myself off to men who are screaming please validate my ego I'm not here for that and neither are you if you're in the glow girl Community you do not have time for that go and begin a course go and  watch my old YouTube videos instead okay I have a video called healthy masculine energy man qualities I'm going to link that in the description after this what you want to look for that video explains the types of so for example men that don't you know how I always say men that don't have social social media as a green flag it can be either the biggest green flag or the biggest red flag men who use social media for their business for their career for their family to post you that is a green flag if it's all  them red flag this video gives more um hacks like that so how to find a good man watch this video learn it's called healthy masculine energy qualities watch this video be on alert and filter out the men that come into your life based off these qualities know these qualities your core um okay oh my gosh I love you Alexis you're a big blessing I wish I was your younger sister sweetie I'm turning 20 oh high respect to you my queen girl you are my younger sister everyone here is my sister yep thank you zna Zena hi  girl one of my sweet students you like the green thank you okay I have to show you girls's dress remember in

like  this it literally just comes like a wrap you tie it around yourself like this and then you pull this is what I do I just was playing around with it tie it around you pull this part up as I try to do it and it becomes a dress this is just one out of the 100 Styles I love fashion you girls know I have a clothing brand so least to wear I love fashion and this thing is freaking amazing so this

okay what is this dress called it's called a wrap dress okay number three this one is this one's so important too so subtle hack  number three now not later this has changed my life I think this is the very first like inner work thing that I started doing and I still do it to this day it changed my life during Co this was one of the lowest points of my life this is when I first started my inner work Journey 2020 I remember there was a time I always use this example I use this in Master Your feminine energy because it was so important for me so I remember there was this time I was walking in my room I was actually sharing a room with  my sister at the time and I saw that there was this sock on the floor and what the old me would have done just left it there and said uh I'll get it later and my sister will get it what I did is I went picked it up put it in the dirty clothes basket excuse me and after that every single little thing that needed to get done I did it in that moment instead of waiting for later what happened every time I would skip over a sock or have cuz I was still in college at this time have a homework assignment  but push it to do on Sunday is it would become this invisible anchor Weighing on me because I knew that I unconsciously would put it in the back of my mind and what I I don't know if anyone else's brain works like this but mine does I have to check things off to know that it's done so now it became this checkbox and every time i' would walk over a stock not do homework not call my grandparents and check on them unchecked boxes that just weighed on me no wonder why I was so broke no wonder why I struggled in relationships I had  no energy this these unchecked boxes the mental to-do list the invisible anchor was weighing my energy down and draining it so what I started doing is nope right now I do it or I don't do anything else until it's done that is how my life Works what I like doing personally is working first and then playing so my morning is the time where I do my admin work work check emails check messages um update the girls in the courses check in with them in the Facebook group pages and then after that I play go with my  friends today I'm getting my nails done hang out with one of my friends tonight watching The Bachelor tonight if I had all these things like um needing to respond to emails that was just sitting as an unchecked box I would have no energy to relax and hang out with my friend tonight to relax and get my nails done and what happens when you're constantly draining your energy all all those ideas that God is sending you that is your gold that is your generational wealth they are disappearing they're  getting pushed to the side because God's saying she can't even pick up a sock why am I going to put this business idea in her lap so now not later is the motto my hair stylist I feel so blessed every single um nail artist hair artist every single what is it called like uh Personal Care stylist that I have is deeply passionate about in our work so my my hair stylist yesterday we were talking she's so into inner work too we were talking about procrastinating and how the root of procrastinating is being  in survival mode because she said the reason why people love waiting till the last minute to get their work done is because they're feeling stressed and I said yes because people love being addicted to stress they love it they might think that they don't but what has happened is they've been stressed over and over over again where now they've rewired the neurop Pathways in their mind and their mind goes ooh there's so many times when we've lit up when we've been stressed we must like this this must be our new Norm this must be our  comfort zone stress so what happens when you go H I want to feel good what will make my brain feel good oh yeah all these neural Pathways that have learned to light up when I'm stressed that's what I need to do how can I make myself stressed let's procrastinate that is how you solve procrastination it's not setting timers and all this stuff that people give you it's inner work this is the inner work heal out of that survival mode heal the stress in your body heal out of the fight ORF flight and stress will no longer be  unconsciously attractive to you I talk about how to do this in the master your feminine energy course and I also have multiple videos on the channel of how to heal survival mode Sandra good to have you in here girl I love what you said about God saying she can't even pick up a sock yeah she can't even pick up a sock why would I go and give her this business idea if she can't handle a sock she can't handle making $100,000 a month mm yep stress is like safety to an unhealed individual and it requires inner work  yep Hi Alexis does the Bible talk about feminine and masculine energy if so can you talk about it please the Bible is the blueprint for feminine and masculine energy I would read the Bible growing up but I always thought H I don't understand it it's just it's not easy to read then when I started doing inner work and I would go back and read the Bible I read it twice in a row 2022 and 2023 it was just so good it was so deep it's like wait God has given us a blueprint for f feminine energy God has  given us the blueprint for deep intimate love he's given us the blueprint for Quantum leaping and manifestation manifestation doesn't come from um all these sorts of theories that people are talking about God gave us the blueprint he teaches us how to plant the seeds he says that when uh whatever we reap we will sew the Harvest so yes he talks about it in the Bible I'm not going to go into it in this video because I want to stick to the topic which is in our work hacks but maybe in another video  video yep science is confirming everything God's already taught us I love science and I love spirituality so here's the next tip so that was now not later the next tip vitamins and supplements these have massively Quantum leaped my life why because when you look better you feel better you do better when you drink nutrients and vitamins your body just soaks up all of this nourishment and you literally glow from within when you're glowing from within and you're feeling good now you have the energy to create I feel like the theme  of today's training is your gold sits in the creativity we talk about this in the gold vault all the time so if you want to create what's going to make you the money what's going to bring you the relationship bring you the dream body you have to glow from within you have to take care you have to nourish your soul vitamins and nutrients is how I do that this why I say it's a subtle hack is because it takes me like 2 minutes to take my vitamins every day and they have made me feel so good they have cleared  out my gut rebalanced my immune system rebalanced my hormones these things seem subtle but when you rebalance your hormones and level up your health again and again and again what happens a year from now you are a completely different body a completely different person if you go and watch my old videos like when I'm in college you can see I was not taking my vitamins my face was literally inflamed oh my gosh my face is so different this what I'm drinking right now I have this in my what I eat in a  day videos you can just type on YouTube all Lexus what I eat in a day I show you all of the vitamins that I take some people say this is so many you know what I would rather take two minutes to do that than be sitting in a hospital bed or have poor health later on so if that's too many for you what are you willing to sacrifice this is a super greens powder so this is the Garden of Life brand it's just a bunch of green vegetables that our body needs and then I also have l glutamine powder mixed in L glutamine  powder it helps restore the lining of your gut helps rebalance your gut health and then I also have water and aloe vera juice aloe vera juice it will clean you out okay that's just a warning in advance also it just makes your skin glow it's like this added hydration that our body and our hair is just craving so that's what I'm drinking what vitamins would you say are a must for women's General Health a probiotic a B12 vitamin B12 balances stress and it helps support energy this is definitely essential for women  because our hormones always affect our stress and our energy omega-3 fish oil this is for men and women but we need healthy fat so that our brain can function so that things can move freely throughout our bones we need healthy fats also one of the most important Macar root I love Macar root it raises your libido which helps fuel your creativity okay we I want to go into this but I have to be careful on YouTube let me just say this when you are in tune with your sensual energy you don't have to do anything the  creativity will just pour from you so when you have a low libido it is typically a sign of having weak health when you have a low libido a low sex drive it's very hard to create because you're disconnected from that glow from that turn on within when your body is turned on your libido is healthy you just create all the times that I'm feeling so good I'm feeling like that my body is just turned on and feeling so sensual so connected to that honeypaw energy I naturally create do live streams courses um everything starting  the book club it's because I feel good so Macar root helps raise your libido as a woman and it really helps to balance your hormones so many things like stress processed foods uh unhealthy relationships throw off your hormones perfumes makeup I love my perfume and makeup but it does throw off hormones so I like the macka root it's a very natural uh root that helps to rebalance hormones yes chizy thank you so much for writing that out for everybody vitamin D yes I'm in the sun all the time so uh vitamin D of course I  just don't take that as a supplement yes thank you ladies for all the compliments thank you okay speaking of hair that we talked about earlier trying to think okay we're running out of time a little bit I'm so sorry that it's Rush ladies so uh speaking of hair something that I started doing that I didn't think would be an inner work hack but it totally was is starting to oil my hair every single night before I go to bed I take this oil I showed you girls uh it's called H ladies do you remember what video it was  that I made recently it was about beauty hacks I think it's called beauty hacks to Glow if you just search beauty hacks to Glow you'll see it I give you girls the oil that I use it's from the Moroccan oil brand every night before I go to bed I put oil on the ends of my hair and I'll also do scalp massages with oil I oil my hair before I take showers and shampoo my hair that has actually Quantum leaped me massively the act of oil in your hair I didn't know this until recently but grooming heals feminine energy grooming putting oil in  the did you say boil um putting oil in the hair that is an act of grooming and it's so healing for the body kind of like how can I describe this you know how people really love ASMR like it heals our nervous system it makes them relaxed you grooming yourself is ASMR to the feminine energy it's your feminine energy becoming rested becoming nourished realizing ooh I feel so good being taken care of when you have a plant let me show this plant oh so imagine when you have a plant this plant is growing so long oh  my gosh so when you have a plant and you speak to it you water it I like to rub the leaves I like to play with them when I nourish my plants allow a lot of sun in the room they grow this plant was so tiny it has grown so long I'm so sad to leave my plants behind when I move to Dubai uh these plants it's like hair when you speak to your hair loving affirmations like you are so beautiful you're so healthy I love taking care of you you're oiling it you're petting it it's like a dog I hate to say this but  it's like a dog being petted just filled with nourishment your hair purrs back to you you like a cat purse saying M that feels good thank you let's continue to serve you now hair is a reflection of health and of the nervous system what I will say is hair is very important it is not everything and hair does not look like one way for example my sister shaved her head a couple was it a couple of years ago maybe a year and a half ago she has never been more in her feminine energy she is so free her hair she was  just so tired of managing it it was unhealthy she felt like so she shaved it off she is rocking that uh the small tight curls on her head her feminine energy is glowing the way that her partner just loves and nourishes her and feels that she's so beautiful has uplevel since then too so hair it doesn't mean you have to have long thick hair to be in your feminine energy to feel healthy no what feels the best for your hair let's say you don't even have hair your a scalp your scalp is really the foundation of what we're talking  about it's not even the Hair It Is your scalp your scalp is connected to the nervous system that is why when your nervous system is rested your hair grows longer and Fuller when I was in survival mode guess what happened my hair was always breaking it was always short it was always thin when I healed out of fight or flight my hair just grew and grew and grew inner work has been growing my hair it is because I'm nourishing my nervous system I'm I'm nourishing my body you don't have to have hair to do this nourish your scalp  hair is just a reflection of your soul and of your nervous system so things like oiling your scalp oiling the ends of your hair just putting lotion on nourish your body and your feminine energy will come to life so much I when I wake up in the morning I'm like good morning it feels so good I took care of my hair last night I made time to groom myself my body is sleeping and what's sealed into my subconscious is you just oiled your hair you feel so worthy of taking care of yourself you feel so worthy of taking the time to pet to  nourish to groom your body now locked in my subconscious as I sleep is I'm worthy of being taken care of I get to feel good I get to be healthy I get to Glow I get to shine this is my new Norm so things like this can massively Quantum Leap you my hair was maybe this length like 2 years ago I don't even know how long it has grown that's a Quantum Leap people will say it your hair only grows like 2 Ines a year nope your hair grows depending on how much inner work you do yeah I love the cat purring analogy  yes uh so the thing is a Sandra so oh Sandra you have curls too though so how to not put it or how to put it on every day without feeling and looking greasy what I do Sandra I don't put it on my scalp only once a week when I'm going to wash my hair I put it on my ends my ends soak up oil so I can put on every day and it will not get greasy my hair rarely gets greasy depending on your hair type maybe you need to oil every other day maybe you just need a tiny tiny bit of oil yes Zara you shaved your head last  year girl and you are beautiful it is so good to see that yep Zar girl I want to see you in book club next month if you catch up yeah okay uh can I take macaroo if I'm 18 I'm I cannot give U medical advice but um I started taking Macaro when I was 19 I started taking it when I was in college and I loved it just check with your doctor before you even check with your doctor check with your body your body is your best doctor because it will tell you and it will reflect physically back to you what is good and what is not  oh that's yeah the coaching sessions oh okay so why I closed the coaching sessions on the website is because I had that weit list up I only have a few coaching spots at a time and new coaching spots are not available until one of my girls that I meet with weekly decides to take a break so none of them have decided to take a break in a long long time that's why there's no new spots that are open so my girls that are waiting thank you I wish that I had more time that's why I'm doing the courses live so that I can  offer you some coaching in there too okay moving on here's another subtle in a work hack this one's actually not so subtle but it's really powerful setting boundaries with promises and I mean setting boundaries with myself when I make promises here's what happens so much of the time when you are one extreme so for example I was a huge people pleaser huge nice girl before what happens when you become aware of it is you swing to the opposite end of the pendulum I think we talk about this in Master Your feminine  energy you have to be so careful of doing this what will happen is you can go from people pleaser to total B if you know what I mean the balance the most beautiful part is right here in the middle the balance of the light feminine and the dark feminine so what happened is I realized being a people pleaser I would always overcommit myself someone would say can you come to this dinner with me next week I would say yes what started happening when I stopped being a people pleaser is I would say no nope nope nope because I  hated overc committing myself when I didn't want to go I love being at home I love I don't love going out unless it's places like dinner or just um my friend's houses things like that when I would uh swing to the other side it was always no I wasn't allowing myself to do anything so here's what I started doing instead let let me check with my schedule and I'll get back to you I stopped making promises what I used to do on YouTube is I will post once a week I'll post every Friday at 1: p.m. that  felt too tight too constricting to me so here's what I started doing I will post when I feel that I'm in a high vibrational energy and I have a powerful message to share I stopped promising I started setting boundaries with the promises that I would make so people ask me all the time can you please tell us when you're going to go live can you give us your posting schedule I don't have a posting schedule I don't make promises about when I'm going to show up because I am a woman in feminine energy feminine  energy changes her mind every single second of the day what if I don't want to go live on Friday but I've already promised myself that I would it puts it used to put me in this tight box and I hated the feeling it was too constricting even making plans with people something that's been happening a lot is people that live here my family in Las Vegas and friends are saying are you going to come back for the holidays when am I going to see you next the old version version of me would say uh yes I will come back on Thanksgiving I'll come  back on Christmas something like that but now I've said let me see how I'm feeling when the time comes and I'll let you know it adds this freedom and just this peacefulness that I never had before because I would either say no to everything or say yes to everything and then have to change my mind there's a fabulous book on people pleasing called Boundaries and it talks about how when you are a people pleaser you say you say yes all the time because you don't want to hurt people's feelings but then when  you cancel plans it actually ends up hurting people more when I read this and I thought oh I don't want to be someone who's hurting people by promising lying and then changing my mind I said let me just stop all together I can be more kind when I'm honest yep uh why did you decide to move to Dubai I have a video called get ready with me Dubai takeaways and I share the story in there okay what else do I want to say yes so when I stopped having so much structure in my life by these promises I would make and overextending myself I  could play more and playing it just felt so good more room for creativity and peace here is the last one this one is so fun I think I talk about this in seductively Savage and master your feminine energy I want to touch on it here too another subtle hack that I've done that has massively Quantum leaped my life is playing around with my Alter Ego with strangers so remember how in Master Your feminine energy we create that new identity like what do you what does your dream woman look like who is that woman  that you just love you admire you think oh I want that life I want that energy who is that woman and I teach you how to start downloading and activating that identity that embodiment well how I do that in a small way is I will do something like go to a grocery store and when I was a woman who was always in the light feminine and it was hard to be in the dark feminine I would start playing around more with being um not being mean but being a bee so I wasn't as smiley I wasn't as quick to talk to men who would  try to start a conversation I was more reserved more quiet maybe I would even do the siren eyes like we talk about in seductively Savage not so much do so I would start playing around with my ultra ego who was sexy who was fierce who was mysterious I started playing around with that with strangers why I say do it with strangers is because your brain it won't activate the alter ego when it's around people that you know it's too hard there's too much judgment but with strangers they don't know the  real you so your subconscious has an easier time letting the alter ego out because it doesn't have all these judgments that it going to receive of someone going no that's not who you are you're not someone who's mysterious why the sudden change play with strangers first and then move it to people that you know that are closer to you to let the alter ego out I swear why I always say practice this kind of every example I say practice this in the grocery store the grocery store in my opinion is an inner  work playground nobody knows who you are you can go to different locations all over the city and show up play with your feminine Energy play with all these inner work hacks let's say you go I'm a people pleaser but I want to learn to set boundaries go play on your grocery store playground and start setting boundaries there let's say you go I want to be someone who has a really sexy feminine Energy walk I want to move my hips I want to move my body I want to be more sensual go and play on your grocery  store playground no one knows who you are you're safe you can get out in like 5 seconds if you feel so uncomfortable and you're around strangers who are allowing you to have this safe space to play around with the new identity and every time you play around with a new identity you seal it in more and more yep I'm so sad ladies tomorrow is the last session the last live session for now of the gold vault course this course has been I can't even put it into words it has been magical it

Y123	https://youtu.be/lQFgAotyTaU?si=Hro9wlzKX1HIdlF1	[Music] hello my beautiful girls welcome in I'm so so happy to have you with me we are talking about habits that that girl has you know the girl that I'm talking about it's the one who glows with confidence and happiness and Security in herself by the end of this video you are going to be that girl so let's go ahead and get started habit number one the woman who carries herself with this energy and number one I want you to know it's possible for you it doesn't matter if you are anxious doesn't matter if  you've been insecure your whole life doesn't matter if you feel disconnected from your own body your own feminine energy you get to have this energy I promise you I have done it in my own life and I've worked with women every single day as a coach to help them transform so I've seen it possible over and over again this is the first habit that you're going to embrace and this is the quote that my mom always said to me growing up it took me a long time to be able to actually understand it the quote is hard choices easy life  easy choices hard life so what does that mean it means choose delayed gratification over instant gratification why is that going to change your life because if you make that choice over and over again you are going to transform into a woman who has been built off of habits to push her further in life here are some examples to show you so let's say that you are in a relationship with a man who you know this man is not going to be your husband he's proven it to you you can either make a hard choice now to  have an easy life later or you can make an easy choice now and have a hard life later meaning you can rip the Bandit off you can end that relationship hard choice in the moment but your life gets easier later you get closer to meeting your true soulmate you get closer to having that life of ease and flow and rest in your body or what a lot of people do because we live in this world of instant gratification Easy Choice now hard life later I'm going to stay and continue to be with this partner because it's  comfortable because we've been together for so many years because they do some good things but I'm going to have a struggling marriage later the choice is yours women who are that girl make the hard Choice first because they know number one they deserve the Easy Life later and number two that it's possible it's like ripping off a Band-Aid yes the first two seconds are gonna hurt but you will get over it pain is temporary and your life gets to be better later you don't have that soggy Band-Aid that's just weighing down  on you here's another example with Health and Wellness maybe it's not always the easiest decision to choose a smoothie in the morning over a stack of pancakes but what's going to make your body feel better long term you can make the Easy Choice you can have something that's going to harm your body and not be the best or you can decide my body is so worthy of loving and nourishing I'm going to make the harder choice now maybe have something with more vegetables which sometimes doesn't taste as good as  pancakes but in the long run I get to be healthy I get to be filled with energy I get to be fueled and you save money in hospital bills later so the choice is yours Health relationships Fitness everything it's not always easy to get up and go and do a workout or go for a walk in the morning but which one does your body deserve 10 extra minutes of sleeping or going outside getting a walk-in reducing your stress connecting to the Sun the fresh air the choice is always yours another example too I love this one  especially for my girls who are business owners or entrepreneurs or want to be content creators choosing your passion over playing it safe this is what I see so much people will go to college and they will get their degree they will listen to what their parents want to do which I do understand and they end up in a career that doesn't satisfy them and they know it in their core they're not meant to be a lawyer or a doctor or whatever it is the field that they're in they can feel it in their hearts  what I love about our generation is that we will choose our passion and our purpose over playing it safe we will say you know what I'm not going to go to school because I know I want to be a nail tech or I know that I want to be a content creator I know I want to be a designer or open up a restaurant you playing it safe does not serve the world and it definitely doesn't serve you so the choice is yours I can continue to play it safe and get that degree that I hate and end up in a job that I hate and 20 30 years down the  line it's a struggle life because you made the Easy Choice of playing it safe and now your life is harder as a result it's harder to leave a job when you have invested so much time in it when your family is relying on it when you've built your personality around it it's harder the harder choice in the moment is saying I'm not going to play it safe I'm going to go and follow my heart and as a result my life gets to be easier later I promise you my girl it is always going to lead to a life of more abundance more  happiness more wealth when you follow your passion that choice tends to be more difficult because there's a lot of fear and there's a lot of other voices saying no don't do it you won't make money it won't work out that business already exists the people in your field don't make money fear make the hard choice to follow your passion and watch it play off later I've never met a person who does this and their life does not get better 10 times so in my own life I don't know if you girls knew this but  I had graduated with a bachelor's degree in marketing I played it safe I knew I didn't want to do marketing I was sitting at a desk job that I hated and thinking this is not what I want for my life I I don't want to work for someone else I don't want to be creative campaigns for me it just wasn't my thing so I said I'm gonna make this scary Choice I'm going to quit this job I'm going to work temporarily in a restaurant as a Hostess and during the day I'm going to use my energy to pour into what I love I started creating  content on Tick Tock started teaching about feminine energy started teaching about inner work and healing so much of what I've been researching and loving studying for myself years and years I just put it on Tick Tock and shared that transformed my life that decision to stop playing it safe and make the hard Choice yes I had criticism yes people at my job my friends were making fun of my tick tocks I didn't care because what I saw was an easy life later I saw a life where I was making money in my sleep  where I was waking up to packages from my favorite brand sending me clothes and skin care where I was able to sleep at and wake up at whatever time I wanted now I'm living that life I've become financially free way happier way more confident and secure in myself because I made the choice to make the hard Choice quit that job follow my passion follow what God was telling me now my life is easier as a result and I promise it's going to be the same for you here's another example too so it's little little things in your everyday  life where you either make an easy choice or a hard life I love to use this example let's say that you're walking around your room and you see a sock on the ground do you pick up the sock or do you leave it to do later hard choice now Easy Life later pick up the sock put it in the laundry bin your life is easier later you get to come home to a clean room a clean house it's not just the sock how you do anything is how you do everything so if you pass over doing things like that that can make your life  feel cleaner and more organized and at a higher energetic vibrational frequency later you are doing that with so many things that you don't even realize it's never just a sock everything you do do it 110 that is making the hard choice but your life will be so much easier later I thank God every single day that I get to live the life that I did it took years of making hard decisions going against what other people were doing choosing to pick up the sock when I wanted to just walk over it but my life got better  later because now I have trust in myself I have internal Integrity I know every decision I make I've given 110 so I have no regrets I've never failed because I did the best that I absolutely could this is going to give you that girl energy that's what's going to give you confidence all right I really love that idea and life of working and then playing and what I mean by this it's not physically working in fact running my business yes it's working but it feels more like playing it's so much easier and more fun  what I mean is put in the work now so that you can play later read the books to grow and expand your mind become financially literate become financially free work hard invest in the work now so that you can play and just enjoy life later we're not meant to be always working and struggling in life that's not how life should be it should be easy you should be in a flow you should be filled up with love and excitement every single day to work up or to wake up and that is so possible for you all right so to recap Point number one  hard choices easy life easy choices heart life moving on to point number two stop talking bad about yourself so many people do this that don't even realize life never works out for me men never chase me men never approach me I'm always broke or yeah that's not gonna fit me I'm I'm fat I'm ugly my Skin's always breaking out I can never travel that could never be me I could never open up the business every word that comes out of your mouth from this point on should only claim the reality that you desire to be living  if you don't want to be broke stop saying I'm broke stop saying money is hard to make replace that with the reality that you do want this is how I change my finances I started telling myself new and exciting opportunities are always coming to me I am a woman who attracts wealth wealth always comes to me money comes to me in increasing quantities from multiple sources I knew it in my core I don't want to trade time for money I want to use my passion and create and money is attracted to me as a result I have this picture on my vision  board and I wish that I had it to share with you girls it's a picture of a woman sleeping and next to her is her computer and there's money flying out of her computer while she's sleeping I saw that picture and I said I want that to be me my goal is to be able to make money in my sleep now I do that now I wake up to a thousand dollars here at two thousand dollars there and it's not from working any harder it's from making that difficult choice to say I'm going to follow my passion I'm going to follow my  art I'm going to only speak highly of myself and stop claiming realities that I don't want to be living this is what happens you are rewiring your brain to know you are no longer available for a certain reality your brain you can only receive what you believe if you believe you are broke you are going to stay broke if you believe that you are only a match for wealth and abundance you will live that reality by the way my girls if you like more of that deeper rewiring your mind how to reprogram your your life and your brain  the master your feminine energy course would be so amazing for you because we go deep deep into that inner work that's available in the description below my girls that are already in it okay this is something that I love I just got this message this morning from one of my students Alexis my man came home with so many bouquets of roses because he didn't know which flowers I would like so he got them all she worked so hard to change her beliefs around what her relationship had to offer her she stopped saying words such  as my man never gives gifts to me I'm I'm never spoiled and she started replacing those beliefs it starts with your mind it starts with changing your beliefs it starts with the words that you say your words your thoughts have so so so much power and here's something else too it doesn't matter if you've been in a relationship where your man hasn't been showering you with the love in the affection that you need you changing your beliefs will change him it will change how he responds to you this happened so much with the woman  that I work with and it's so possible for you a huge lesson from you was knowing no one was going to come in and save me no one was going to come in and change me so I am in charge of the words that come out of my mouth and the beliefs that I have do not claim any beliefs for yourself that you do not want and for those of you who are new I'm a feminine energy and inner work coach and the very very first thing that I do with every single one of my clients is catch the words that come out of their mouth that don't  align with the reality that they're telling me that they want so for example a lot of women will say Alexis this might sound dumb but and I will catch them and say nope not allowed here you are not allowed to say any words that come out of your mouth are dumb you are not allowed to say that you are lazy or that you cannot achieve this or that it's just too hard for you that you're always broke that you're not beautiful enough you're not allowed to say that while we are coaching because you are training your mind for the reality that  you desire there's a reason that we are here there's a reason I'm even speaking to you wake up to the areas where you are dumbing yourself down and talking bad about yourself unless you want that reality all right what else did I have here so a huge part of this too is knowing why we do this why do we talk bad about ourselves no one truly wants to do this well it's a way to keep ourselves safe maybe we had grown up in a culture at least for me in high school every girl did this we talked bad about ourselves  to be able to fit in same comments such as I failed that test again like I always do or I'm just gonna be single forever why do we do that it's to fit in it's to get validation from other people to say no no no you are smart or no no no boys don't like you they're just too intimidated to approach you it is so much more empowering for you to give that validation to yourself than to seek it from other people I promise you that so if you live or if you're in a friend group I used to have a friend group like this where we would always  talk about our downfalls and be the victim get out of it or stop giving energy and time to those conversations they're not going to push you forward all right what else did I want to say okay this is a bonus tip too so I forgot which video I had talked about this and I think it was called goddess energy habits and I had said that the most confident people in the world don't allow other people to make jokes about them jokes dumbing them down and I got a comment later that said Alexa sets really sensitive if you're getting  triggered about someone making a joke about you and it confused me so much every confident person that I know myself included does not allow people to make jokes at their expense why would I allow anyone else to make a joke that can make me feel less than why would I not call that out why would I let someone try to reprogram the mind of my inner child that is inside me that is no one's job except myself and every joke I believe has a layer of Truth underneath I do not accept any truth that I don't believe in  so if someone is making a joke about you or dumbing you down I get so mad because a lot of people do this to my sister my younger sister and I'm very protective over my siblings and I told her you have to respond by telling them what did you just say or don't say that about me you have to shut that down otherwise you you are teaching yourself I accept to be done down I accept to be told that I'm less than no that is not acceptable you can always put a stop to it so another phrase that I would probably  say if someone's making a joke about you is I don't understand and watch them try to explain the joke that they just made they will feel so dumb doing it do not give time and energy when people make jokes at your expense that girl would not allow people to do that to her okay let's see okay here's tip number three I love this one get ready even when nobody is looking why is this so important because again that quote that I said how you do anything is how you do everything so you are teaching yourself when you  get ready and there's no one home maybe you're working from home or it's a Saturday or Sunday excuse me you are teaching yourself that you no longer perform for others I used to be that type of girl that I would only dress up if I was going out or I would only dress up if I had to work that day now I get ready no matter what because I don't perform for other people I perform for myself I get to feel good every day I get to show up the way that makes me feel my best so even if you don't see anyone get  ready for the day I'm not saying you have to put on a full face of makeup and wear heels no just wear something that makes you feel good even if it's like a cute satin set for pajamas or sweats it's whatever makes you feel good for me my days where I have a day off I like to make sure that my skin is healthy and glowing I will do my skincare I'll make sure that my hair looks nice maybe I'm wearing sweats but that's what makes me feel good because I've taken care of myself stop performing for other people just by  getting ready when you're going to see others another part of this too so I used to always think when I was growing up I'm gonna dress so sexy when I go to bed for my husband I'm gonna wear you know the cute night dresses and pajamas all of that but then I realized wait a second Alexis you're not even doing that now and you haven't met your husband yet so what if you start dressing and not dressing up but what if you start feeling beautiful and sexy when you go to bed for yourself then it will actually be a habit when you meet your  husband because guess what happens later in relationships and this happened to me if you're not dressing the way that you want before you meet your man you won't do it when you meet him you'll do it for the first month and then it changes so build the habits before your partner even comes into your life that you want to take into that relationship just getting ready just taking care of yourself is a huge part of that habit and another part of this too I was so guilty of this so I'm just gonna call myself out when I was doing  that marketing job a couple years ago and I had a lot of meetings on Zoom I would wear a cute top and then guess what would be on the bottom pajamas or sweats do not do that because you're teaching yourself to half-ass life guess what happens if you have a cute top on the on your top and then you have bottoms that don't match or aren't your best self that go with the outfit you are going to perform that way in life your energy will always be half ass and you're teaching yourself I'm not truly in full alignment right now mentally  during those meetings I knew oh I'm wearing pajamas it doesn't feel like I'm the best and most complete and again it's whatever makes you feel best maybe pajamas are your best when I would show up on meetings wearing a cute skirt that would go with that top or cute pants that actually matched my energy and confidence was another level and it's the same thing with even things such as socks or little pieces of jewelry make sure that from head to toe literally everything aligns with that best version of you that's what's going  to give you the best energy all right what else did I want to say about this yeah so you're creating your habits now that you're gonna live or that you're gonna have for the rest of your life so make sure that they are your dream world habits and I love that quote that says dress for the job that you want not the job that you have I used to be so extra when I had my hostess job working in that restaurant right before I launched this business I would do things like wear a lot of jewelry and do my makeup a  lot and have really nice nails and I did that because I knew I want to be a content creator I want to be a business owner I want to be that woman who just wakes up and is living her best life dresses how she wants and is running her business and is so full of life so I thought how would that version of me dress and I started doing it I knew that I would have beautiful nails I knew that I would invest in doing my makeup every morning and I started doing that before I even had this life that's what's going  to attract it to you dress for the job that you want not the job that you have okay Point number four listen when your heart is speaking to you the women with the most confidence security radiant and true happiness in themselves they do this they listen when their intuition speaks here's an example so I remember before okay so I had made like maybe five or six random tick tocks right before I kind of knew I wanted to be a content creator but I didn't know it fully there was a time that I went to  the grocery store and I was spending the day with my mom she looked so cute she had this beautiful dress on and in that moment I realized my mom is living the life that she taught me she always taught me be your best in every area dress up even if you're going grocery shopping because it will change your energy and it will change the people and opportunities that you attract so I took my phone out took a video of my mom she's like picking some mangoes or whatever looking so beautiful and I posted that video on  Tick Tock with that caption the way you dress affects the people and opportunities you have thank you Mom for teaching me this that video exploded I had I think 200 followers at the time but just all my family and friends I reached 10K and I think a week that changed my life my girls and you know why that changed my life because I listened to what God was saying God spoke to me and said Alexis pull out your phone and make a video even if you don't understand it your your body is trying to tell you something God is  trying to tell you something listen when your heart is speaking to you because that's what's going to change your life from then on I use that momentum that I had built from that one viral video it got I think 800 000 views in the first day now it has over a couple million I believe and I just kept creating tick tocks more and more and more and then my account grew to a hundred thousand in less than a year and then I started this business so that small nudge that small whisper from God saying take this video  me deciding to follow that changed my life and that's how it's going to be for you when you get that nudge to read that specific book to call that friend to go to that coffee shop to visit that country that's not out of the blue that is your heart your intuition God speaking to you follow that if you do not follow it you are dimming down that connection to your intuition and your connection to God and it will be very very difficult for you to hear it later on so start just opening up your body and learning how to receive that wisdom  how to receive those directions in that map and a great great tool for you if you want to be able to open up your body and hear what it's saying more is the master of feminine energy course that is going to help you learn how to connect your feminine energy feminine energy it's all about being in your body how to understand what your passion is where your heart is guiding you how to just be magnetic so that you can attract everything life is not about always putting in work and working very hard to  receive it's about a certain way of being and you attract a certain Life as a result so stop second guessing yourself listen to those Whispers from God listen to what your heart is telling you to do okay number five and this is the last Point invest in your mind oh this is the most important thing I'm gonna say all day the reason why so many people are depressed and stuck and don't know what they're doing in life is because they stop investing in their mind and I teach about this in the course one of the ways  this is in the lesson I believe on how to raise your energetic vibration how to become instantly magnetic and happier It Is by learning there's so many studies that have shown that novelty wires our brain for happiness novelty is the idea of newness it's new information new knowledge so when we go to school and we're studying and we're learning our brain is growing when we stop and we go into the job that we think we're supposed to be in or we stop learning in general our brain slows down and it  begins to Decay and this makes us sad it lowers our serotonin levels that is why people are unhappy they stop learning invest in taking a class maybe it's a dance class invest in reading a book one of the best books that you can begin with is Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill this is the first self-help personal development book I ever read it changed my life invest in taking that course or investing in a mentor invest in watching YouTube videos listening to podcasts rather than music choose the hard choice  now maybe you want to listen to music but you replace that with the podcast your life will be easier later there's something in there that your brain is craving to learn all right what else did I want to say about this oh yes another so I always say books and podcasts but here's two other things that I really think will help you number one is Yoga I love yoga and I had talked about this in the course why it's so beautiful you're teaching your body to trust itself again when you are holding that pose you're  holding that move you are reversing any trauma that you've experienced that is why yoga is healing it's not just meditating and breath work it's learning to trust your body physically and mentally so yoga is a great place to invest in your mind to invest in yourself another thing is a public speaking group I'm a part of one called Toastmasters you girls have always asked Alexis how can I learn to speak better to talk better and communicate I have invested so much even in my college that I went to we were taught to  stand up and to make speeches and to learn to debate learn to invest in these types of activities for yourself and you will speak with more confidence you will speak with more clarity just reading books too will help you learn how to speak better all right I'm really lucky too I have the best friends in the world they have taken so many of these classes with me one of my best friends is in Toastmasters with me and it's so fun get girlfriends who care about themselves to invest in themselves you guys will  Elevate together so much all right I know that I just said a lot so let me recap those points real quick then I'll take some of your questions so again number one how to be that girl hard choice now Easy Life later I promise you that and then again easy choices hard life later so you choose which one you want stop talking bad about yourself stop putting yourself down stop fitting in it's not cool Empower yourself instead number three get ready even when nobody is looking stop performing for other  people and start choosing to only show up for yourself that's going to change your confidence number four is listen when your heart is speaking to you follow those Whispers they are not coming out of nowhere I promise you and number five is invest in your mind it is the most important investment you will ever make you are so worthy of investing in choose to invest in yourself daily all right my girls let me take some of your questions how are you watching you it's part of my mind invest ment oh Jen thank you girl  Alexis when is the right time to kiss a man on a date because most men want to kiss in the fifth date or sooner what do you think girls express your opinion too I love you okay so irony this is a good question girl and I my number one response is always follow your body what is your body speaking to connecting with your feminine energy is going to help with this my personal rule is I don't kiss on first dates I don't care how much I like the guy I don't do it and the way that he responds really helps me to see his  discipline and his level of self-control and respect for me I did not kiss my previous partner until maybe our fifth date and I did it when I felt that I had learned his values better when I thought yes he could be a match for me I could see investing in this relationship and when I felt safe with him if you feel anxiety around kissing a guy your body doesn't feel safe with him and he's probably not the match for you so allow yourself to be in that rested State connect your feminine energy listen how does your body feel around  this man and then you'll know when it's the right time to kiss him hello I love your videos thank you girl hello I finished journaling all that you said thank you so much oh you're welcome girl your videos are my therapy I love you hi from India greetings from the UK sending love from Paris oh my gosh so my full women all around the world today I'd like to know how to recognize and connect to my intuition Fatima beautiful question this there's a whole section about this in the master feminine energy  course that deep knowledge is there for you but here's a tip that I'll give you now how to recognize your intuition I also have a YouTube video called how to know the difference between your intuition versus anxiety your intuition will feel very quiet and it will feel very peaceful anxiety feels stressful it feels loud and it feels very quick and chaotic your intuition doesn't usually make sense has nothing to do with the thoughts the experiences that you've been having so for example I'm trying to think of the last oh yes  okay I'll share this story with me or with you because I feel that learning through examples helps me personally so my clothing brand or my women's loungewear brand is called solist aware you girls can go and Shop when I was starting that I actually wanted to start a swimwear company I had ordered so many samples designed a lot of swimsuit sets I had purchased the website domain I had set up my website so least to swim and I was going to launch it I was ready to go something in me said do not do it  that came out of nowhere I was on track I was ready to do it that was God telling me nope that was me listening to my intuition so I put that project on hold and I was really upset I thought I'm I want to do this I want to create a swimwear this sounds so fun guess what happened a few weeks later my mom had given me one of her old robes and I put it on and felt like a goddess I don't know what it is it's like you know that feeling when you go to a hotel and they have those robes for you that level of luxury that's what I felt  sitting inside my house doing my work and I realized where can I get more cute robes I could not think of a place that's when it hit me Alexis you be the one to open up a company that sells robes that's what I did so Lisa where it was born and I now create a lot of pajamas and robes for women to go and shop and feel sexy going to bed so that was my intuition speaking so Fatima when you get that nudge that doesn't really make sense that is your intuition that's what you're going to want to listen to  thank you for all of your knowledge you share I am so happy and honored to share with you thank you hello I love your videos I've been separated from my narcissistic husband of 17 years wow and going alone with six kids I am broken but I know I deserve better praying for a better future Selena is so proud of you girl I have personally dealt with a very very narcissistic man in my life before and my heart goes for you any woman who's been in this

plant-based diet I really love fueling my body to feel good from the inside out and I believe that the way I eat and the vitamins the nourishment I give my body it shows up in my skin and my teeth and my hair if you want to know more of the recipes and the vitamins I use a good place is to go to my YouTube channel go to the videos I think they're called spend the day with me or what I eat in a day because I will show you everything I  do wow what a lovely surprise to catch you live stream for the first time Ira welcome girl first time let's see bonjour how to start journaling please any tips dealing with the hard time in my marriage yes Samia so here's a journaling prompt that I'll give to you what needs of mine are not being met in my relationship freely journal and write it out what I want you to do after that is see if this is a need that you have to get from your partner so for example a lot of the women that I coach the reasons  why they struggle in their marriage is because they feel their partner is not giving them time or love or affection and here's something that can help you give it to yourself I know that it sounds so easy and you probably hear people say this all the time but here's what's going to happen so I had one of my clients she would never get taken out on dates by her husband and so what she started doing I told her girl go and take yourself out on the most beautiful dates get dressed up get in that high  vibrational energy go to your favorite restaurant just have the night to yourself tell your husband that you're going out you're just gonna have a solo date when she came back he was waiting by the door asking how was it uh would you do would you eat and she was a little bit more detached because she was so validated in her need of being taken out on a date and being loved and spoiled and cherished cherished she gave that to herself so because she didn't need it from her husband her energetic vibrational frequency was in abundance  it was no longer in lack when she was in the lock and she felt my husband doesn't give this to me he was matching that vibrational frequency when she had it her husband guess what he started doing I swear this always happens let me take you on out on a date next week I want to plan something for you where do you want to go her vibrational frequency switched so whatever it is that you need or you're craving from your husband or your boyfriend or your partner give that to yourself put yourself in the vibrational  frequency to match it and then you open up yourself to be able to receive it it is the craziest thing and in your marriage too I might take so this is going to put you more in your feminine energy shift away from the relationship I'm not saying leave the relationship I'm saying pull your energy off the relationship put it in a new area where can you put your Creative Energy right now you are a woman you are filled with a natural gift of creativity of Life of Radiance what can you pour that into that is not your  husband maybe it's going and taking a dance class maybe it's learning to explore your sexuality more maybe it's learning how to cook or start a business or create content it's the craziest thing how this happened my girls who have an anxious avoidant attachment or an anxious attachment Style I want you to pull your energy off your partner put it on

J126	https://youtu.be/BmVSLqCh-RI?si=EhCQ2DaKl9metLtS	hi my name is season mulan and today we're going to talk about one of the most common side effects of dogs suffer in 2020 all over the world and that is called separation anxiety of course i want to talk about how dogs develop separation anxiety and of course how can we help now let's begin our training remember i don't train dogs i train humans so let's understand when dogs live in their own natural habitat with their own kind with a pack of dogs with their mom their dad their aunts and everybody else their  family they're always together they're always always together they're always following someone or they're always waiting with someone so they're all they're never alone and they're always following so they never have this understanding of they have to live separate okay so when a dog is with someone is his tendency his natural tendency is wherever that human goes he follows whatever that human stays he stays wherever the humans live he sleeps with it so the following the resting the staying is always together so for a dog  that natural way of being is to follow someone always and to be with someone always so we have to keep it in mind so we understand where they're coming from so coming and living with us we practice a different lifestyle sometimes we don't need or we don't we can't have somebody following us children our spouses our our moms we actually practice separation because we practice a completely different lifestyle we go to work we go to school uh we go to church we go to the beach and sometimes we don't want  that person or or or a dog can actually follow us into that environment so it's not natural to them to ever not follow someone and to ever not be with someone that's what they become members friend because they will follow us to the end of the earth and they will stay with us even if we're homeless so literally we leave dogs inside the house what the human goes away to work goes away to school goes away to travel goes away so the dog is always inside the house so think about it the dog has lived in quarantine for a long period of  time right now with the cover 19 we're all living in this lifestyle of being inside a place which dogs have lived that way for a long period of time but for a dog it's natural it's natural to be with his family 24 hours a day seven days a week if you go to the bathroom they follow you if you go to the kitchen they follow you so no matter where you go it's like a shadow right there with you they want to stay with you no matter what you're doing if you're stretching if you're walking if you're running  inside the house if you're resting if you're sleeping they want to be right there with you that is natural so so this coven 19 has brought togetherness in order to survive which for a dog is natural for us has become unnatural so i think it's very important to understand because once this uh quarantine is lifted and then we we are going to go back into what is natural to us because that's the only way we can actually buy food water pay for the rent of the house or the mortgage or whatever it is right  so it's food water shelter and family so that's those are the four things we have to take care how do we do it we go to work and so a dog doesn't go to work with us unless it's a service dog right but most dogs they got to stay inside the house so they're going to go into this separation anxiety once again and it's going to be a lot more dramatic this time because for months a dog has lived under this unrealistic lifestyle for us right so something to take in consideration not to alarm you it's just to make you  understand for me it's all about uh if you if you understand where they're coming from you you can practice patience you can practice creativity you can practice strategy you can practice using the right energy you know you can practice exercise things that i'm going to share with you in order for for them for them not to develop separation anxiety so now that we know why dogs living with us in this lifestyle that we live are more likely to develop separation anxiety by us understanding this natural way of living how do we  help them to live with us and this unnatural lifestyle of living together and then separating you know because we have to do that from our parents from our children from our home uh from anything they they actually live with us so so we know that but that's a conscious decision we make they don't do that consciously so we have to help them exchange this natural lifestyle that is for them help them live this unnatural but it needs to feel natural so how do we do that this is what i need you to do i  need you to count how many times your dog follows you throughout the day okay so if you walk to the bathroom count it if you go to your living room count it if you go through the uh uh to your bedroom counter if you go to the door counter there's a delivery everything if it's 20 times just 20 times it's 30 times it's 30 times i just need you to count it because it's very important for you to know how many times your dog followed you throughout the day it's part of the strategy that i want to teach you so once you know how many  times your dog follows you throughout the day i want you to cut that in half and that's when we get to train a dog to begin to live a separation but in a natural way now we're going to help our dogs to understand the separation from this point on is going to mean peace love calmness a challenge so we're going to make sure that they have fun as they practice this separation activity all right so the easiest way to teach a dog actually uh the art of separation is you need a point of reference i'm gonna  show you uh with sophia how a point of reference can become the place where a dog can go to a happy place where a dog can go to a peaceful place where a dog can go to a resting place or sleeping place for that matter so it's very important for them to know that this point of reference is going to give them something and this is why the separation must happen so they actually do it as a game so two things that i want you to be very clear okay so because you need to visualize what you're going to do before  you do it so your dog knows that you have something in mind and you're so certain that you are going to make it happen and the calmness behind is extremely important right it's part of your tools your energy your strategy and your tools that's going to help your dog see this activity of detaching not following being by himself having self-confidence having self-control right self-discipline in order for them to understand that this unnatural activity is fun and it became natural so i purposely have this bag of treats  that so i want you to see how this the nature of a dog when you have something that smells really good or even without this you know that your dog is going to follow you all over the house so it's i just want you to see that the nature of a dog following you no one puts a leech uh inside a house to a dog because they know the dog is gonna follow them okay so come over here so the point of reference hey guys the point of reference is gonna help you because they're gonna start associating that staying there  to do a task to stay there to detach meaning start following you and begin to stay alone there the point of reference is going to give you access to start teaching your dog they're following you is not a bad thing the waiting for you is not a bad thing so come back so never call the dog off once you are teaching a dog to be to stay in the point of reference so you need to do this in different places of the house so when she sees the point of reference which is eventually can be a bed can be a carpet can be a  little mark whatever whatever you want it to be they know that by you pointing they're supposed to go there because a detachment is going to happen and then they have to wait so that way they understand that you're setting up the house in order for them to understand how things work right so you can use the point of reference before before you go into the kitchen it gives you a distance it's the distance that we're looking for is the stuff following you that we're looking for but if they see it as they're going  to gain something out of it and at the same time they're participating a dog is going to be always willing to do whatever makes you happy whatever makes you feel clear whatever makes you feel confident whatever creates this joy this love this you know this understanding you don't always have to give a treat you can just give her affection in a calm way right because when you when you want a dog to really understand separation you always want to reward with calmness with silence with with gentleness with  with uh with the understanding that you want relaxation and return right separate anxiety what what what it means is a confused mind that makes the body tense and so the mind is confused and the body stands you're gonna hear sounds so that is just them letting the energy out but we want that the mind is clear and the body is relaxed and that's how they're going to understand to stay there as you go so practice this like i say if 20 times do this 10 times or during the day so they have a point of  reference they've had they have an understanding throughout the day sometimes i follow the human to the kitchen sometimes the human challenged me not to follow him to the kitchen but he gives me something to do so as long as you exchange activities they're going to be willing to do whatever it takes to keep that team alive that pack alive that family alive and you get that understand you get that that focus you get the feeling of we're doing this thing together and when you leave just leave calmly  confidently leave that energy behind leave trust that your dog is gonna stay there it's a good girl even in the reward the reward you know it doesn't have to be super excited with sound it can be super exciting with the smell so okay remember never call your dog from the point of reference because you're teaching separation and you're gonna reward the waiting and the calmness so you're gonna reward that they're not following you and they're gonna reward that they're waiting for you al by themselves that's the reward that's why  you're rewarding you're not rewarding that you're not you're not rewarding that they're laying down sitting down no you're rewarding that they didn't follow you and you're rewarding them they are waiting for you that's what you're rewarding so just be clear just understand that you have to feel that they don't have this inclination of following you and they don't have the inclination of not understanding what they're doing what you're teaching is this unnatural behavior of not following and being alone is unnatural you're  going to turn it into natural because they're going to understand if they don't follow the human and they wait alone the human is happy the human rewards the human gives affection the human challenge see you turning something unnatural to natural so now throughout the day throughout the day throughout the day make sure that you practice a small distance of separation especially when you're gonna open the door you know especially let's say you are welcoming not too many people because we're practicing social distance right now but  this is part of the separation right it's being separated from the door being separated from following the human all the way to the door let's say you want to talk to somebody for her this is an activity she's not feeling bad that she's not with you she's actually feeling good because you're challenging her yeah and you're making it clear so when it's time for us to go back to our unnatural but natural lifestyle by going to work go to school and make a living she's gonna be prepared they're gonna be  prepared they're gonna understand okay now the human left but he will come back but he told me not to follow and he told me to wait for him so to be alone there's nothing to worry about and not following him is nothing to be concerned about i know what to do so that's what you want the dog to know that they know what to do by practicing this unnatural but you turn it into a natural lifestyle hey guys i hope you learned the dog develop separation inside it because it's not natural for them not to follow  someone or to be alone so now that we know that dogs can learn to separate and have fun and be peaceful and loving and it's a challenge so when the human comes back and asks them to follow they can reunite peace save and love 
Y130	https://youtu.be/XRhr1aQ39pA?si=pjW9DbiorOOREOCr	[Music] I get asked about my sexuality and eating disorders um like it's like my right and left arm and in a lot of ways I love that because I've been so incredibly open about it and it's something that I you know really um not enjoy talking about but feel like I want to I want to sometimes I think with that comes being asked a lot of really dumb questions um and uh being asked things that make me uncomfortable and then having to like reroute in my head and be like did I ask for this and then I'm like actually no I didn't um  that was just ignorant um so there's that uh but I also think that like there's a level of there's comfort in in community right and like I think like when I you know I've been out for 10 years but that doesn't mean that I've been out to like you know everyone in my family that doesn't mean that I've been out to everyone in my personal life that doesn't mean that I've been accepting of myself whatsoever um and so I think like when I was very open about being gay like publicly it became a lot more um  um fun for me to celebrate myself in that way and it continues to um it continues to I think that we there is like a ginormous like conversation surrounding like obviously like I've was um late like sex as a college girl she's a lesbian um you know all of a sudden I was doing like these interviews and people were like yeah how does it feel to be like a um like a face of uh queer culture or things like that or how ever they would word it um and I think that it's really sick I think that it's cool I think that  it makes me very proud and it makes me want to be better I also think that like trademarking like a white um sis bisexual woman is like the Pinnacle of queerness in media is really um uh silly and stupid and palatable so there's a lot of nuance I love being gay so much uh I enjoy it thoroughly now at this point in my life which I feel very good um to say cuz I don't think you could have like paid me to say that like a couple years ago maybe even like a year and a half ago probably not um but yeah  there's there's there's Nuance of course with with everything um but yeah I hate I hate being asked ignorant questions I'm like oh my God oh my God you know it's like it's like yeah like let's like talk about it in like the way that is like like moves some kind of needle or like is a human conversation maybe not a way to like get me to say something that you think is going to be interesting online yeah cuz like I know that like I'm not stupid like I'm like I see what you're doing you know so yeah yeah I  hear that so just want to double check so Hope High School Northwest transferred right so that Northwest was was that your senior year or I transfer my junior year of high school and did you play golf at both schools or I played golf at Hope well do you still play I do I do still play I played recently I can't remember where oh we were going oh I didn't play actually we were doing Top Golf on tour um yeah CU I'm like that's my uh yeah I played I played in middle school and high school and then when I moved to Northwest um  they it was it was an art school we didn't have any sports programs I think that I come from um two parents who are Workaholics um to a fault uh for sure um I come from uh like small pretty small town like South um where I felt very estranged which um says a lot granted that I'm at the end of the day so incredibly privileged um so yeah I mean I I don't I don't know it's it's in spite of certain things and it's also because of certain things but I think like the biggest because is like I just always knew that this was what I was  going to do regardless and I didn't know how or like why um and I still really don't know how or why just like with like what I you know would like to accomplish in the next X amount of days or years or the next like three hours to be honest I don't really know how or why um but it will happen and I'll make sure that I'm working hard to make that happen and if it doesn't then um well actually no it just it just won't well and when you say that it's it you do mean being a pop star right that's what you're referring to because  it is interesting doing anything that I want to do it's all yeah yeah you always envisioned the like from what I've read it seems like the singing was really the North Star yeah yeah and everything else was like I don't know how would you just like a cherry on top icing on the cake or it was it was just like a a welcomed blessing that was a means to get to what I wanted to do um and I've been and I really enjoy it and I love it um I've been called like SP I've been called like I've been called like um like Brady and stuff like  that and I love when people say that to me specifically because like uh you know if if somebody like if you watch like men in interviews talking about like yeah like I just I needed a job or like yeah I just like I wanted to do this cuz I knew this would get to that and everybody's like oh my God he's so brave he's so cool he's so cute and then like when like a woman says it or like a non-man says it everybody's like oh my God how spoiled um but I'm going to keep saying it cuz I do mean that and it was  a means to get to where I wanted to be so you think it pisses people off because it looks like you are not fully appreciative appreciative of what the other things were that were yeah absolutely because if you're a woman or or a non-man and by the way on 10 different levels let's be clear um but like in my case and in like the body that I occupy like if I'm not bending over backwards um and I'm like oh my God I'm so grateful I'm so uh lucky to have this opportunity and like really like kissing the hand that feeds  me then I am um like a problem and um happy to be that very happy to be that I mean you have always seemed to have this attitude that I think is it's I mean even the turning down the touring you know for like that took a lot of of of course yeah was it hard was it a hard decision no it wasn't no um I mean I think in ways absolutely because like in my brain all I wanted to do was get my parents to let me move to New York and they were like you're not doing that without income right so that's my first offer of  like actual tangible income um so yeah it's in a way difficult but it's also not because I really do have a certain level of trust in myself when it comes to work that I'm going to figure it out um which is also a huge blessing and I was raised in a family that like made me feel like I could do that like financially and and tangibly um so I'm cannot sit here and say like yeah it's just because I like work super hard like that's definitely a part of it um but I was also like really fortunate to have  that like delusion of like yeah I'm doing that and not to be fostered of course of course so when you were growing up were you did you take like were you in theater basically from when you were a kid or was that not no um I I mean I started I was I danced my whole life that was like the first thing that I really did I started dancing when I was three and um you know I was always singing and like putting on little shows in the house and around the neighborhood and things like that and basically just  like taking whatever opportunity I could um but then my mom uh was like you should do like a musical and I was like all right you know I'm down so I went and I auditioned for a musical when I was 10 what was it it was Annie and uh yeah it was it was very silly and very fun and I was like a added orphan which was huge dub um yeah and yes so I like I started I started doing it but not in a really serious way I did it as a means to like a for my parents to get me out of the house cuz I was very rambunctious and um  problematic and also to like be on stage and to be singing like that was the only thing I cared about that was the only thing that I loved like I loved playing sports and stuff but I hated school not a good student um therefore also not like a great person to myself and like probably my teachers um so yeah you're very thoughtful though why why do you think you weren't a good student I didn't like it I didn't like it I don't um I think that I don't deal with authority well and I know that about myself um and  that's not to say that I don't deal with authority as a whole well I don't deal with not being respected well that's also not to say that every single teacher I had disrespected me however as a girl in the South with Incredible anxiety and massive undiagnosed ADHD couldn't focus um mental health was just denied and and not a thing um it was like constantly being disrespected and and laughed at and I think personally for me like when I have kids like if my kid is like I have to use the restroom they're going  like they're actually not asking me I understand there's a different level of that for safety and teachers and I really respect that however I never felt respected as a kid so I always hated Authority always hated Authority that disrespected me and so I'm very wary of that now and I've definitely dealt with that in professional settings a lot and I'm sure that so many people have again on very different levels like I'm lucky to have agency over my space Bas in my business and what I do now um but I  hated it and I did not want to listen to anybody um and I still don't like listening to people that disrespect me and I really like that about myself I do think though that like my parents were raised in a generation where like mental health is not a thing you pick yourself up by your bootstraps um uh being gay is kind of weird uh being bisexual is not a thing and you should pick a side and and um being emotional is a sign of weakness and women are um to cross their legs and cross their tees and do their eyes and  that is the thing right so like in so many ways I was so respected and also in so many ways I was so disrespected and I have always been um a little fighter I've always been a little fighter I'm very uh insecure and emotionally vulnerable at the same time I am very Scrappy and I do not like to be crossed and that has always been my thing so that's just kind of how I was that's how I came out of the womb like that is just how I've always been in spite of everything around me that's so interesting are there things you miss  about the south no I mean in a way in a way like I find I find that I connect with uh people from the South a lot specifically because like there is a certain like ring to like southern hospitality and like decency and stuff like that however I think like that gets manipulated in the South and used against um people and people use like southern hospitality and like things like that to like excuse like hateful behavior and like homophobia racism things like that um misogyny uh which is dumb but I mean it in the most like pure  sense of like there is a respect um and a care for the people who are around you and I'm like a big care caretaker um and I like people around me to be caretakers and and care about how I feel care about where I'm at just as I would do for them so I missed that um and the food nobody makes good southern food like they do in the South like anybody out here is like oh we should go get I'm like what's your favorite I'm like I'm not doing it um well I like just like traditional southern food like I'm trying to like  eat like meat coll greens mashed potato any kind of potato like mac and cheese but not like mac and cheese that they have out here like I want like cornbread I want like biscuits I want like good stuff like that I want like vegetables that actually taste good and not just like boiled broccoli that somebody made from Nevada I'm like I'm not doing that that is disgusting people don't know how to like season yeah um so I'm curious like when you look back and on Co and everything everything that was happening in that  time would you have auditioned for sex lives had the pandemic not happened no interesting no um I would have still been in my Mean Girls contract and I wouldn't have been auditioning uh Broadway wise um cuz I only started auditioning because my agents at the time were like yeah I think TV is going to come back quicker so do you want to start like auditioning for some stuff and I was like sure I was like I don't really know if a that's something I would do like cuz I don't think that's something I  could do like I'm not sure that I would like get a job like that I also didn't really know how to like self tape or do things like that but at the time I had a boyfriend who like helped me like learn how of self tape and whatnot um and that always ends up biting you in the ass because the second that like a man like helps you do something and then you like do it well they just hate it and it's like it's so scary for them poor baby uh and it's crazy but you know respect uh it was just so weird um so yeah like I don't  think that would have happened um had the pandemic not happened which is so like cynical and feels incredibly s like silly to say um but it is logistically the case yeah for sure so how when you look back on that experience as you're sort of really in music mode right now how how do you feel about that like I feel I almost like hate saying like I feel so lucky just because like I know that like that's what some like man in Denver wants me to say however I do feel that way um I do feel really lucky and I  feel really um grateful to have done the things that I've done to this point especially because I didn't think that I was going to do those things cuz I didn't think that I just I just wasn't thinking about acting like that um I always thought that like and I still do think this like actors are really really intelligent people and you have to be very fearless and you also at the same time have to be incredibly insecure to be able to get in touch with yourself so it's this very like double-edged sword um and and  complicated like internal Persona I think um so I've always really like looked up to actors I've always just thought they were so cool I just didn't think that was something that I was capable of um so I'm really happy to have done it because I think I have learned a lot about myself um I also like really am I wouldn't say like I'm glad I got burned the amount that I did but I would say that like I'm really proud of myself for how I've taken hits in Burns um behind theen scenes in privately and turned them into uh good  things for me and that doesn't mean like I've turned them into things that make me happy but actually doesn't it just means I've turned them into experiences that make me proud of how I've handled myself as a person and especially as like a young woman in the business I'm I'm proud of um not taking sh uh even though it makes me feel terrible for having to do it just because that's inherently a societal an internal response um but I'm I'm really I'm really proud of that that's been my biggest like  thing over the last four or five years is like I'm I'm not uh I'm not somebody's yes yes I'm not I believe you yeah and I'm not going to be that it's it's inherently the business right like it's inherently the business it's inherently um culture I think that you know in a lot of ways it's really really amazing and I think it's really um beneficial and I think that it's obviously changed the world in incredible you know like like big steps I think um I think it's also just like more damning and more exposing which uh  is also really incredible in a lot of ways and is really beneficial I think culturally is really important um because everything is much more visible uh I also think that with that comes like the opposite side of like you know people just saying silly ignorant things um and it's you know I'm I'm 23 and I see everything on the internet and I understand that the whole thing is like oh okay well you know protect yourself from it like give yourself peace give yourself Grace and things like that and  like yeah for sure but also like I think that's very difficult for for me to do um and uh it hurts like I'd be lying if I say it didn't like bother me however I think that resilience being one of my like words from this year is just like okay like if if that's what um someone is going to think then that's okay and they can have that and if that's accurate then perfect you form your own opinion and if it's inaccurate it's actually not my job to um correct you cuz it's not your business I mean don't  get me wrong I used to think about it all the time but at the end of the day like I am pretty myself um that doesn't mean that I'm incredibly confident I just am myself to a fault um and like I'm not an actor first so like no one is going to see me as that because that's not what I do that's not how that's not how I conduct my business anybody in my life who has seen me as an actor first that I was in business with I'm no longer in business with with that doesn't suit me that's not what I asked  for and that's not what I'm working toward and we mutually agreed to work toward the same thing so if that's not the case then good night um that's not who I am so you're not going to see me as that and that's just because I'm not going to do that like I'm going to do what I want like I could be going through the worst thing on planet Earth and like all I'm thinking in the back of my head is like oh this is what my next album is about I don't care if that's sick that's what I do like and I've I've had like with  like ex Partners I've been with like you know I've just been like like we'll be in like a blowout of an argument and I've been like babe I got to tell you something like just out of transparency all I'm thinking about right now and I'm telling you this so that you're not wondering why I'm like completely dissociated from the situation all I'm thinking about right now is like what song I'm making from this and I'm really sorry but that that is what I'm doing doing how do they respond well I I anybody who I'm with or  who is in my life in an immediate way they know what they're signing up for like you know and I'm I'm also I'm not saying it in a way that's like malicious or manipulative or disrespectful at least not intentionally and it will never be that for me CU I really respect the people that I keep in my company um it just is who I am and it's just how wired and that's like how I express myself and communicate it's it kind of I mean it goes all over the place I think it depends on where I'm at usually what  happens is I like think of a phrase or a lyric or a word that like sticks with me and becomes very um like prickly um I write that down and then I usually go in um with Alexander and uh we pick a Sonic kind of palette for it and then we just like run and that is literally how it comes to be it starts off like very poetic like it's going to be something that really sticks and if I don't have something that really sticks um then I'm not getting a song I don't like to do stuff that way or if I get the song I'm  not going to like it like that's why I don't like I have a song Too Well that I like notoriously hate and everyone knows that I hate it and I don't mean that in like a I hate the I mean in a way like I just I genuinely don't like it I don't like it because it wasn't written in the way that comes from my little Cranium to make it perfect emotionally for me so you are very you are meticulous in ter of jering and very thoughtful yeah it Tak to get that process from the prickliness the face and it's very frustrating and I  have again really severe ADHD which is the coolest thing as a writer because I have so many thoughts and so many ideas at the same time um but I also am very anxious in the way that I control it um and I become a little weird and that's how I do it I guess I think well the Carpenters are my favorite um I think Karen Carpenter it I was just like not you can't really you can't like put it into words I also think like not only is she incredible but she's also like one of the greatest drummers ever like she had  an incredible struggle with um her own personal like eating disorders and stuff um before she passed and so I've always felt this like very cute like string to her um I used to listen to the Carpenters with my dad growing up a lot and then I like figured out that they long to be was then sampled and dubbed over by Stevie Wonder into a talk box um and then was that was sampled into a Franco Ocean song that's all my favorite album that I have a tattoo of and I learned all of this later um and it makes  me I love it so much I think the Carpenters is probably my like more surprising one I also think like Steve Perry is like one of the best vocalists ever Perry I love C Perry so much I I mean like Journey was everything like Dad rock is a huge huge influence to me and then also like heart like I think like those sisters are incredible um I have like a lot of R&B influence but I always I always talk about it like I was I was so fortunate to grow up like listening to like music and like with a music business that was  like honestly like just so like off the backs of like incredible black female artists um like I have always been obsessed with jazine Sullivan I think that she's a vocal Bible I think that the industry has done her wrong in so many ways and she's just now starting to get her flowers which is another thing that I'm like y'all are crazy she's perfect um and like obviously like Beyonce is like the blueprint like she's everything like the the the music that I consumed as like a kid um and as like a  white girl in the South I was very very very privileged to be able to listen to and and take inspiration from it it sounds like silly because she's obviously had such a like amazingly lengthy career already and has been grinding for a really long time but I think that like siza has shown a lot of people up this year um I think that especially with like the SOS tour like I think that she's proven herself and she didn't have to yet like she did I think and like I've been a huge fan since I was in high  school um and she was putting out like whatever I forget what that like pink mixtape is but like it you know I think that this was really her year um and she solidified herself as like one of our generation's like greatest musicans and also one of the most like powerful um people in the business business uh and also women um it's been a it's been a big year for her and she's like finally getting her flowers I'm like thank God I'm like it took so long and for what um I saw Frank O Coachella this past year  and I think that um the internet and the music industry uh ripped him to shreds for literally no reason and to me that was like one of the Breakthrough like days of my life this year with was getting to watch him perform um at Coachella um I've never seen him before and he's my favorite artist of all time um but I think that 2023 in my life was a huge defining year um from seeing him uh and from like witnessing somebody be so like incredibly vulnerable and honest and um uh thoughtful with their art and  to like watch them get like torn apart uh was really disapp pointing and also really eye opening and so I think it's almost like a I mean it sounds silly but like that's like a that's like a breakthrough in my brain for him I'm like oh he just got solidified as the coolest and he already was for me

Y140	https://youtu.be/XWQvmh_INTQ?si=v-4C8hpOuNvo_4R2	forward head rounded shoulders and a Donald Duck Butt look familiar honestly you don't realize how bad your posture has become until someone stabs a pic of you don't worry use my new and approved five minute posture routine and I guarantee you'll fix this in no time let's talk about how you got here in the first place so studies revealed that most people sit on average for at least six to eight hours a day and when they do they're sitting like this but don't feel the need to straighten up just because I said that this slouching  position isn't necessarily bad some studies suggest it might even help you focus more in fact I'm slouching right now as I write the script for this video the problem is most people stay locked in this hunched over posture for hours on end every single day and your body is an adaptation machine over time it'll tighten up certain muscles and weaken others in order to become more efficient at keeping this hunched over posture there's five simple yet extreme the effective exercises we'll use to reverse  this starting with the upper body the first exercise will help open up your tight chest and shoulder muscles I'll show you how to make this work with a towel blanket or broomstick but I'd highly suggest you use a band and I'll leave a link in the description box to the one I'm using start with your hands inside the band with your palms facing away from the sides of your thighs but if you're using a towel or broomstick grab it with a very wide overhand grip in front of your thighs keep your arms  straight and move your arms in the circle up and behind your body let your shoulder blades and traps shrug up slightly on the way up and then let your shoulder blades come down and back as your arms travel behind your body the benefit of using the band is you can widen it by pulling it apart during the spots where your tight is but if you're really tight your body will try to cheat by arching the lower back prevent this by keeping your core engaged you may also notice some clicking in your shoulder or that you can't keep one of  your arms fully straight that's completely normal and it will improve over time but once your initial grip gets too easy you can deepen the stretch by looping the band around your palms to shorten it or take a narrower grip if you're using a stick or towel as for how many sets and Reps to do at the end of this video I'll show you the full routine written out for now just focus on the form for each exercise next before we get to strengthening your weakened upper body muscles we need to unlock your tight mid and upper back  start on all fours with your hands under your shoulders and knees under your hips to make the stretch more effective place a foam roller ball or folded up pillow between your legs and squeeze it together engage your core to straighten your back and push the four away to straighten your arms then take a big exhale as you reach your left arm under and across your body as far as you can you can allow your right arm to bend slightly as you do this you should feel a deep stretch in your mid and upper  back and maybe even your lats from here bring your left hand back behind your neck push the floor away with your right hand and follow your elbow with your eyes as you rotate it up towards the ceiling only as far as you can you should feel some of your mid and upper back muscles working as you do this hold the top briefly then come back down and try to reach a bit further than last time once you do both sides you may notice that one feels a lot tighter than the other that's perfectly normal just  do this consistently and it'll help correct that imbalance over time not so the first two exercises will temporarily open up your tight upper body muscles but to keep those results and fix your posture for good you need to pair that with a strengthening exercise the one we're using today strengthens your weakened back and shoulder muscles to help pull you upward lay on your stomach with your forehead on the floor or held just above it and hands behind your head pull your elbows back imagine squeezing  your shoulder blades together once you've gone as far as you can extend your arms straight out to make a capital y shape with your palms facing the floor keep your arms straight and held as high as you can above the floor and begin to slowly move them in a big circle around your body you should feel your mid back and shoulder muscles working as you do this as your arms come below a t-shape start to internally rotate your arms so that your palms now face the ceiling once your hands are close to your legs  bend your elbows and place the back of your hands on your low Back Lean one hand on top of the other then reverse the circle by extending your arms and slowly move them back into the y shape and then to the started position with your hands on the back of your head I'll be honest this is quite a difficult exercise so if you're having troubles with it for now try this just keep your arms in that t-shape with your thumbs facing up and use your mid back muscles to raise your arms as high as possible  hold that top position for a few seconds while squeezing your shoulder blades together and do both 5 to 10 reps of this until you build the strength to do the full exercise okay so before we move on to the lower body it's important you don't just do this five minute routine and go right back to sitting in your chair for the rest of the day this routine will work wonders if you do it consistently but to fix your posture for good and honestly just feel better day to day you need to make an effort to  move more break up your sitting with standing go for more walks or check out some of my workout videos to get you in the gym in fact Studies have shown lifting weights can improve flexibility just as much as stretching does a precise-based program that shows you exactly how to work out week after week to transform your body while improving your posture mobility and overall health after this video go to build with science.com and take my analysis quiz to find the best program for you and your body but for now it's time to move on to  your lower body so the main lower body muscle you need to strengthen is the glutes these often become weak in those who sit for most of the day but before we get to that it's important to first loosen up your hip flexors some research suggests that if this muscle is tight it can inhibit glutes activation start on all fours and set your right knee close to a wall or an elevated piece of furniture like a bench couch or chair use your hands to help put your back foot up on the wall or bench the closer  your knee is to the wall or bench the more stretch you'll create in your quads so if you're pretty tight then just start out with your knee further away once you've set your back foot step your other foot forward so your shin is vertical and straighten your hips in front of you the then use your hands to help you get into the half kneeling position from here breathe your core and level your hips as if it was a bowl of water and you were preventing the water from spilling forward at this point you  should already feel a deep stretch in the quads and hip flexor of the back leg the intensity of this stretch should ideally feel like a four or five out of ten so the lessen the stretch Lean Forward whereas to deepen it push your butt back towards your back foot just make sure that you don't arch your lower back as you do so now you're ready to strengthen the glutes the exercise we'll use is simple but to maximize activation it's important you do it right lay on your back with your knees bent and feet  flat on the floor angle your elbows away from you and push them down into the ground engage your core to flatten your lower back against the floor without arching your back squeeze your butt muscles hard and then lift your hips up while keeping your glutes contracted at the top avoid arching your lower back instead keep your core engaged and tilt your hips back by squeezing the glutes hard as if you had a hundred dollar bill between them and you were trying to prevent it from falling out hold this  for five seconds before coming down for another rep now if you feel this more in your quads rather than your glutes try walking your feet out further away from you whereas if you feel this more in your hamstrings move your feet a bit closer in and over time to make this move more difficult and to help correct any strength imbalances you might have in your glutes you can progress to working one leg at a time here is the full five minute routine you can also download this routine onto your phone completely free over at buildtooth  science.com posture fix try to do this routine at least twice a day and again just make an effort to move more good luck and give this video watch next for what I believe is the most underrated exercise to lose belly fat that you can literally start doing right now 
AB150	https://youtu.be/vAgn5R3EUnU?si=k9m9TkuVx0X2VY0m	What if I told you these ridiculous ads... Did you say I’ll feel better smoking Philip Morris? [Narrator] Yes, you’ll feel better! ...are not all that different from these ads? Now, every box of Kellogg's Rice Krispies cereal has antioxidants and nutrients that help support your child's immune system. For decades, massive food conglomerates like  Kraft and Kellogg's have made over $1 trillion through the manipulation of  food science and food scientists, and ultimately us. And their goal is much like big tobacco's:  to do and say whatever they can to get people to buy their product over and over and over again until their product is no longer a want, but a need. until their product is no longer a want, but a need. To whose advantage is it to keep the  public confused about what to eat? Well, obviously it's the food industry's advantage. Ultra-processed foods make up over half of the American diet, and do so with little scrutiny from  health experts or government officials. And the food industry is terrified.  Even if Americans skip one  ultra-processed snack or meal a day, sales would plummet by 7%. Every five years, the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee meets to review the relevant research and give the American public advice about the latest nutrition science, a process food conglomerates are attempting to sabotage as we speak. I mean in every possible way in which they can use their money and political power to encourage people to think their products are good and are willing to help them sell their products,  they're going to do that. The evidence is grim. Ultra-processed foods are being linked in study after study to things like heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. Researchers are beginning to understand that  many of them are functionally addictive. So who will win in this battle  between big food and science? We set out to investigate, and in the  process learned the disturbing truth about how Big Tobacco's lies continue to make Americans sick. So what exactly are ultra-processed foods? We asked molecular biologist and  nutritionist Marion Nestle.  These are foods that are  industrially produced. They require machinery and they require  ingredients that you don't have access to. So industrially produced, designed to be irresistibly delicious— that's their purpose. Corn on the cob is unprocessed. Canned corn, frozen corn are processed. Doritos are ultra-processed. It's not just junk food, to be clear. Many breakfast cereals, granola and protein bars,  diet foods, frozen dinners sauces, and yogurt fit the ultra-processed label and are implicated in causing disease.  A few years ago, I was writing about salt, and I went to the biggest companies and I said, look, you know, salt has become like this public enemy number one because of its links to heart disease and—why aren't you,  like, cutting back on your use of salt? And Kellogg's, you know, said to me, hey, come on in, we'll show you. That's Michael Moss, journalist and author of <i>Hooked</i>, a book about how food giants exploit our addictions. And we put some saltless corn flakes in the bowl. I didn’t even know corn flakes had salt, but they do.  But these saltless corn flakes went in a bowl, we put some milk on it, took a bite, and before I could say anything, the chief spokeswoman for Kellogg's was sitting there with me, and she gets this look of horror on her face, and she swallows and she blurts out,  "Metal! I taste metal! M-e-t-a-l!" And I was kind of thinking the same thing, which was one of my fillings had come out and was sloshing around. And the Chief Technical Officer was sitting there too, and he's kind of in charge of all things scientific,  he laughs and he goes, "You know, not all people taste it, but one of the beautiful things about salt for us is that it will mask," cover up, "some of the off-notes," bad taste, “that are inherent to kind of the manufacturing process.” And so the reason you see so much salt, sugar, fat and other sort of problematic ingredients in these products is that the companies are using those ingredients as part of the industrial process for the manufacturing, for the shelf life, things you don't need to worry about as a home cook.  While our food environment is saturated with the salty and sugary goodness of ultra-processed food, something else is happening. We are constantly bombarded with nutritional  advice about how to stay healthy, what foods can ward off cancer or diabetes, and which ones are slowly killing us. And these two realities are actually deeply related. Let's go back to 2015, when Kraft successfully marketed their singles, which cannot legally be called cheese, as a health food. Kraft American Singles have double the calcium  of many other American slices, plus vitamin D to help grow strong bones. In 2015, Kraft teamed up with the  Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, it's a professional group of nutritionists and  dietitians, in a campaign called <i>Kids Eat Right</i>. [Jon Stewart] What if a company wants the positive PR of going healthy but doesn’t want the hassle of  actually improving their product? Well, there’s a solution for them too. We do want to move now to a new “Kids Eat Right” label  that will soon be appearing on Kraft Singles.  One of the things that food companies do is  they partner with health organizations: the American Heart Association, the American Diabetes Association, the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. And the idea is, if you can donate to those  organizations and support those organizations, then the organizations will thank you on their products and they will say, you know, “a partner of,” or whatever, and this makes it look like it's an endorsement of the product. As researchers begin to understand the real  effects of ultra-processed food on our health,  food companies continue to exhaust every option to make sure the science of their foods doesn't hurt their bottom line. Sound familiar? Tobacco companies had a big problem. You know, 50—more than 50—70 years ago, there was research coming out  that  linked cigarette smoking to lung cancer. So the first thing they did was  to cast doubt on the research. Not enough people in the trial,  wasn't adequately controlled, could have been due to other problems. When it comes to ultra-processed food, the industry is stacking  panels and writing op-eds doing just that: Ultra-processed foods are too broad a category, they say. People might accidentally forgo a healthy food that fits the bill. And listen, there's good scientific questions around the ultra-processed label, fringe cases and exceptions to the rule, for instance. But food companies aren't trying  to further the science. They're trying to torpedo it. So, number one, cast doubt on the research. Number two, cast doubt on the researchers. Then you buy your own researchers.  You recruit researchers to do their own studies, and you give them a lot of money to do that. And here lies the tactic behind not just the fight over ultra-processed food, but all of the confusing nutritional advice we get exposed to through the media. Is the problem with childhood nutrition that they don't receive enough vitamin D or calcium? Kraft sure thinks so. Is exercise more important than diet for weight loss? I sure don't know, but Coca-Cola funded a bunch of studies that say so, just in case you thought about cutting back on soda.  Food companies and their trade associations literally flood the academic space with money. Ever heard that people who eat breakfast are healthier than those that don't? Those were studies sponsored by Kellogg's and other breakfast food manufacturers. It's the food industry's advantage to keep the public confused. We can actually quantify how corrupt funding from corporations and trade groups can be. One review looked at industry-funded studies and found that [almost] 60% showed results favorable to the sponsor.  That doesn’t seem so bad, except that only  3% came to an unfavorable conclusion. The Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee should, in theory, cut through all of that noise and give the American public good scientific information so that they can make their own decisions. But nine of the 20 members of the  committee had some conflict of interest with food, pharmaceutical or weight loss companies. The food industry doesn't want any suggestion  in dietary guidelines of eating less of their products.  It's really simple. Remember those oddly similar ads we played a few minutes ago? It turns out that some of the biggest food companies were owned by tobacco companies until the mid-2000s. Philip Morris owned Kraft and General Foods, R.J. Reynolds owned Nabisco until  Philip Morris eventually bought that too. So it's no wonder why the same  misinformation playbook is being used. What I really wanted to know was,  how far did the similarities go? Did the execs at Philip Morris coach Kraft on how to hide the health consequences of their products?  Did they go even further and actively try to get people hooked on their products? My name is Tera Fazzino. I'm an assistant professor of psychology at the University of Kansas. For a number of years now, I've studied what are called hyper-palatable foods, For a number of years now, I've studied what are called hyper-palatable foods, and they have combinations of nutrients that typically don't occur in nature, and they have combinations of nutrients that typically don't occur in nature, and so they tend to be really rewarding  to consume in kind of an unnatural way.  So we may find ourselves, like,  continuing to eat these foods even though, like, we're getting physiological signals telling us, oh, please stop, we've had enough. So peanut butter, which is almost  all fat, is not hyper-palatable. But if you add the right amount of salt or sugar, it is. Like if this jar had a bunch of added sodium or we had a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup. We conducted some analyses and found that the foods We conducted some analyses and found that the foods that were produced by tobacco-owned food  companies were 29% more likely to be classified  as being hyper-palatable foods relative  to the same types of foods that were sold during the same period of time by  companies that were not tobacco-owned. Michael Moss described to me the moment during his research when his perspective on the addictive nature of these foods flipped. It took place during a meeting  with a former Philip Morris lawyer. Steve Parrish, the general counsel,  we were sitting and chatting. And he said to me, “You know, Michael, I'm one of those lucky people who could smoke one cigarette a day,  put the pack away and not have  any compulsion to pull it out again until the next business meeting, or the next day or whatever. But I couldn't go near a bag of our Oreo cookies for fear of losing control and eating half the bag in one setting.” And it was, like, so revealing to me because it reinforced to me that they know. I mean, the heads of these companies don't eat their own products. While the tobacco industry got out of the food business for the most part in the 2000s, other companies took a lesson from their  success in selling these addictive foods.  They accounted for roughly  50% of the food supply in '88, and by 2018, they were, you know,  almost 69% of the food supply. So we had like a 14 percentage point increase, which was pretty dramatic. The non-tobacco-owned food companies observed the successes of the tobacco-based food companies in the market and reformulated to keep up. As someone who studies addiction, I think a  lot of the rhetoric is, well, you know, if you open a sleeve of Oreos and  eat the whole thing, it's on you. It's your lack of self-control.  I mean, what is your sort of take on that? I think that narrative serves the  food companies and not us as people. These foods are designed this way and they maximize, you know, they can maximize company profits. These are the current stakes for the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee. What will the federal government come out and tell the American public about the health effects of ultra-processed foods? The Food and Beverage Issue Alliance, a mega trade group of other trade groups like the Sugar Association  and the American Beverage Association, have already given this statement: Another trade organization has urged the committee to discontinue using the term “ultra-processed” until there is consensus on an evidence-based definition. I'm not going to tell you what to eat or even how to eat, but I think it's a reasonable expectation for anyone  to have access to good scientific information, to have dietary guidelines that reflect  evidence rather than industry funding. Ultimately, this is a first step in a long process.  One of the first studies linking tobacco to cancer was done in 1950. It wasn't until 1998 that the tobacco companies conceded and struck a deal to pay states for the medical damage they'd done and stop their aggressive and deceptive marketing practices. If we don't start now, we won't get another chance to set the record straight until 2029. 
S152	https://youtu.be/R251drj4HjI?si=kvfImTy22CV5AcHT	I'm letting fast food companies control my diet for the next seven days and Sonic is first up your new peanut butter burger looks good like this message if you think I should eat 15 that'd be crazy if they replied that's so sick I wonder how many other places I could get to do this it's time for dinner for the next week I'm going to find out just how much I can get fast food companies to challenge a guy like me to eat which could be quite a lot considering that only a few hours before this I asked  every fast food company in my city to challenge should my next meal be 200 or 250 McNuggets rule number one I have to finish every challenge I get this week 10 or 12 burritos for dinner I'm trying to get a little beefier rule number two I'm only allowed to eat what fast food companies tell me I can eat I ate your entire menu once and it was the best decision of my life like this and I'll double it if I break any of those rules this week how many of your wings should I eat for dinner my record is 150 not to brag or anything then this  challenge is failed hopefully I can get some decent sized meals this week that's going to be rough going into the week I had no idea how many replies I was going to get these are outstanding and honestly I didn't have the highest expectations but in my opinion they just need one more thing which is why I decided to add a bit more calories to the first meal more peanut butter and even though I may have gone a little bit too overboard all right that was a bit too much peanut butter I was able to finish off meal one with a W woo  the week was starting off fantastic and it was about to get even better all right it's time to see which companies reply back boom all right so we have two DMS Del Taco and crumble crumble just hit me with quite an unexpected surprise I'd like to eat a ridiculous amount of your cookies in my next challenge how many do you think it should be challenge accepted wow these are much bigger than I remembered the last thing I was expecting was free food so to get that and a challenge was a win-win 9 out of 10 that was  Sensational and even better news these cookies were going down easy 7.5 out of 10 I think this is strawberry cheesecake M good thing I'm getting some fruit in today but the second box was twice as heavy first box down and it also had twice the calories woo look at that all my chocolate chip cookie lovers drop a cookie Emoji Down Below in the comments as I started on the two chocolate chunk cookies I could feel a massive Sugar Rush approaching 8.5 out of 10 now we have the canoli flavor thankfully the canoli flavor was  pretty low on the sweetness scale but the next one up Not only was the sweetest n out of 10 it was the only one that wasn't actually a cookie the cinnamon Square woo I think it was pretty clear I have no words it was my favorite box number two is down I'm about to have quite the sugar good thing I've got some salt coming up next your new beef burrit tacos look incredible I'd like to order a bunch of them in my next video but I can't figure out if I want 20 or 30 how many do you think I should order hi there I'd like 30 beef burrito  tacos please this should be interesting no I knew that was going to happen well I was a bit overwhelmed with how many tacos were in my car I was blown away at how good these tasted Bia tacos are filled with meat cheese and come with a sight of broth for them to be dipped in which takes their flavor up a few notches I got to say my first time at D taco and I'm definitely returning cuz it's amazing after all the sugar from earlier the sodium was exactly what I needed until I got to Taco number 16 oh I feel like I'm  tacoed out right now even though this was more than I expected it was worth the surprise that came a few minutes later my goodness that was a lot of salt that's sick that is so cool you know what I wonder how many fast food restaurants I can get to follow by the end of this video now that I say that I hope I don't get blocked I drove home thinking day two was over but what happened next was about to show me how unpredictable this week was going to be all right you guys Papa John's just DM me I have no idea what I said to them  your new epic garlic stuffed crust pizza looks yummy reply to this with a pizza Emoji if you think I should order enough for a family of six okay I just got to say I have no idea what I was thinking when I typed that DM how many people does a large Papa John's Pizza [Music] even Papa johns's response made me realize one crucially important thing about this week DMS could pop up in my inbox at any time this is when I decided to aim to finish each challenge as soon as it showed up in my inbox because of  challenge just stacked on top of each other my chances of making it through this week would be cut significantly speaking of cutting things this is how I cut carbs on another note this pizza was delicious but there was one last thing I needed to do before I decided whether it was truly epic or not there's always room for while house at the party I thought Papa John's DM was the last surprise of the day but there was one more waiting for me there is no way that could be a fast food place it's like 8:00 I thought all the fast food  places are going to be closed that was just an email from Papa John's asking me to rate my experience to which I'd give it a five out of five stars I feel like I just took a bath and garlic admittedly I was pretty full at the end of day two that was a lot of food but after getting free cookies and a major fast food place to follow me the week was starting to feel less like a challenge and more like an adventure but unfortunately what was waiting for me next was something I've never faced in any challenge I've ever done now it's  time to see how many DMs I have in my inbox today I'm not going to lie yesterday was a little much so today I'd be okay with a little bit less ouch that's kind of disappointing I guess I can wait a little bit hey I'm at the store how much toilet paper did you say you wanted go ahead and get the family size Raising Canes that's cold man don't worry I still love you I figured some place would take their time with getting back to me but after looking at the clock and seeing that it was already 3:00 p.m. there was only one thing I  could do got to send some follow-ups I figured that if I gave a few of these companies A little nudge I'd get some of them to challenge me I got surprised today but I'm 99% sure I'm going to have a lot in store for me tomorrow why is this starting to feel like all my past online dating experiences all right now I'm frustrated and hungry rule number one is that I'm only allowed to eat what companies tell me to which I thought would be interesting if they gave me a challenge of their own but now that was working  against me I was going to need a new plan I've already messaged every fast food company within a 20m radius of me so now I'm expanding fast food restaurants to fast casual restaurants as well and maybe I should be a little bit more persistent This Time menu is looking a bit small only 250 items I bet you won't challenge me to eat everything on it fast casual restaurants typically have smaller followings which I figured would give me much higher chances of getting a response six or eight racks of  baby back ribs for dinner I dare you to challenge me but with how hungry I was there was one more thing I wanted to try maybe fast food places rather comments more than they rather DMS your pen Pizza is fire like this comment and I'll eat how do I want to do this if you think I should eat 10 of them tonight whoops I kind of messed that one up but I did just send seven new places DMS and I'm very confident I'm going to get a reply to no DMs I started to think this entire challenge was just a waste of time but  this week was about to take a very surprising turn you guys I just got a DM from Olive Garden I cannot remember what I said to them last year I ate 16 bowls of your pasta reply with a pasta Emoji if you think I should go for 18 I bet you won't oh man this is going to be this going to be rough even though I was incredibly hungry after 2 days without eating I knew that I was going to have my work cut out for me going into this meal if I do manage to beat my old record you got to do me a solid and  subscribe to the channel if you haven't already I knew that if I was going to break my old record I was going to need some extra motivation to eat faster cheese ravioli up first after 2 days without any food every bite of this pasta tasted incredible I got to work on the ravioli and after only a few short minutes I had four out of 18 plates completed first four plates are done oh man woo but as I started on the two plates of lasagna I ran into into an unexpected issue that's not good all right technical difficulties  back to work oh man what do we do next so many options spaghetti meatballs I just want to say if this video gets 70,000 likes I'll do this again but with actual food brands because there's a lot of food brands that actually follow me that I had no idea about after the first plate of spaghetti I realized I had forgotten something crucial in my opinion it's a crime to go to Olive Garden and not order bread sticks but it's an even bigger crime to go to Olive Garden and not do this use your bread stick as an edible  spoon the thing about pasta challenges is that they always start out good but eventually the sodium always catches up with me last count how many plates of pasta I'm at but figuring I was probably near the halfway point I knew the last thing I could do was slow down I was able to finish off the spaghetti and set my sights on the five cheese ZD next you guys got to comment down below what your favorite pasta dish is mine well what's coming up next saving my favorites for last is a method I usually  use to get through meals like this oh man it's going to suck but at this point I was just hoping I was going to make it there I can't take it anymore I need reinforcements I know every Italian watching this video is going to cringe but you know what there's always a place for Ranch at the party while the ranch was good at plate 13 my body was fighting back so hot right now and not in a good way I mean actually like heat hot even though I was eventually able to make it into my favorite pasta I was beyond full all  right 14 plates are down I have quite the pasta baby right now despite the fact I looked 18 months pregnant I was Within Reach of beating my record but I had four more plates to go oh a few minutes later I had finally arrived at my old record oh man this is more pasta than any human being should be physically eating I really just have nothing else to say except make carbs great again get this shirt if you love carbs like I do Emer can buy to beat a record like this in the middle of a week-long eating challenge definitely  surprised me well everybody the good news is I beat my old record but the target was 18 and a challenge is a challenge completing this challenge was a total surprise all right I held up my end of the bargain subscribe you haven't already while you go do that I'm going to lay on the couch like a beach but it wasn't the only surprise of the night yes I would say that is worth the food baby that I'm currently experiencing even though I was beyond stuffed I was glad that my persistence earlier that morning seemed to have  worked but I was about to find out why you should always be careful what you wish for everyone day five last night was kind of a lot I'm not going to hope that today I get no food because I did that a few days ago and I feel like I oh your P Pizza is fire like this comment comment if you think I should eat 10 of them tonight 1.7 million followers oh well they're not even going to like it anyways well it looks like I was wrong one Domino's pan pizza clocks in at 2400 calories multiply that by 10 and you get  24,000 calories of pizza which now I had to find some way to eat I just hope it doesn't have pineapple on it I knew there was no way I was going to be able to finish all these pizzas on day five so my strategy was to eat them over the next day or two which I thought was a pretty solid plan until this happened please be any Emil oh come on you got to be kidding me dude I ate 10 pizuki once I'm thinking of trying to break my record think I should go for 12 question mark the exact thing I didn't want to  happen was now happening while I could have kept eating the pizza the sodium from the night before had fried my taste puts so I decided to end this meal and set my sights on the bazookis instead my stomach's about to be more upset than my scale was after I stepped on it last night that's not defensive or anything pray for my soul and my pancreas I decided to get some no sugar added ice cream because you know got to wash my calories somehow my strategy was to go after the bazookis and if I still  had the stomach space work on as much of the pizza as I could 8 out of 10 on the plus side after all the salt I had eaten in the last few challenges bro these bazookis tasted incredible sugar [Music] cookie a brain free pick that up later no cherries really that's lame after the hot fudge pizuki I went after the one I got by mistake my least favorite white chocolate macadamia nut I'm going to give that one a three out of 10 no offense BJs but that just ain't happening as I got into the two triple chocolate chunk pH cies things  were actually going better than I expected but a sugar crash was on its way and it was about to hit me with full force all last one's 8 out of 10 this next one I have really no idea what it's doing on the menu but we have the gluten- free pizuki moment of silence for everybody out there that's gluten-free this next one I'm very excited about the Strawberry Shortcake had to get some fruit in at this point my worst fear was getting another reply in the middle of another meal all I could do is keep eating and  hope it didn't [Music] happen we had the last two pizookies and if I can get these down BJs I will have beaten your challenge no offense though I probably won't be eating pizookies for a long time after this fortunately for me I didn't receive any other DMS for the rest of the night oh my sweet goodness but with how unbelievably full I was at this point oh I'm going to feel that one tomorrow morning and the fact I had 20,000 calories of pizza still left for me to eat I knew that if I did get another  massive challenge there'd be no way I was going to be able to make it through the rest of the week so needless to say when I checked my DMs the next morning I was a little nervous day six I'm dance no challenges was good news for me now I just had to focus on finishing the rest of the pizzas only nine pizzas to go everyone I have nine pizzas on my table and my goal is to have them all finished by the end of today my strategy was to get as much of the pizza down as soon as possible so if I did get any  surprises later on I'd have the stomach space to handle them but as I started on the Wisconsin six cheese pizza I realized that was going to be much easier said than done pizza number two is down see what we got next I know a lot of people are going to be concerned about the calorie content of this challenge I just want to say don't worry I got some Diet Coke to help cancel out all the calories after some hopefully obvious sarcasm I moved on to the next pizza and after that is when things really started to go downhill oh man  this is not going in a very good direction oh look at that I'm trying so hard to contain my excitement and this is when the unthinkable happened sweet goodness it has pineapple on it to be any other topping why did it have to be pineapple oh oh oh the ranch may have been able to save me but this pizza was taking up way too much space in my stomach I can't believe I just subjected myself to that I moved on to the barbecue chicken next but at this point pizza was the last thing on my mind it just like tastes like pizza  at this point my worst fear was getting another notification and having another massive meal to eat and with the noises my stomach was making that was the last thing I needed not good which is why after counting the pizzas I had left and looking at the clock excuse me I decided what my next move needed to be my stomach is in another dimension but I have five pizzas left I just got to figure out how I'm going to finish them it was clear that all the food I'd eaten this week had caught up with me so before I came back  to the table a few hours later to eat more calories I figured I would try the burning some instead dang it this did get a little extra charred there's some cheese action right there the texture change definitely reinvigorated my taste buds for the first few bites at least my goal was to finish these pizzas oh my sweet goodness I should say oh my salt goodness cuz there is no sweetness at all in any of this and with how full I was that was starting to become less and less likely I feel like I'm intoxicated with  pizza right now I don't even know what this one is looks like it has vegetables on it which is probably really good for me right now it just tastes like salt at this point as I took each bite I only got Fuller and Fuller this was not looking good I really don't like piz right now sorry Domino's and with another entire day still left in this challenge I could get a DM at anytime I knew I had to finish as much of this pizza as possible oh man oh I wish this was a vegetable as I started on the eighth  Pizza each bite was becoming more and more impossible for me to eat all the dough toppings and cheese were taking a valuable stomach space why couldn't this just be a salad I may have been able to make it through seven pizzas but with two left I had reached my Breaking Point nope can't do it as midnight approached I realized there was zero chance I was going to be able to finish the last two pizzas the only option I had was to save him for the last day all I could hope for was an empty inbox when I woke up  the next morning please no DMS please all I got to do is just finish those last two pieces I knew that getting through this day was going to be harder than I thought this is going to be very rough the only thing I can do was wait for my stomach to settle which is exactly what I did for the next few hours in ironically the same chair I was in a few days ago when this challenge first began boom that's so sick even though it was almost 5:00 p.m. I finally sat down to get started on what I thought was the  end it's going to be a long time before I even want to look at pizza ever again but little did I know I was about to learn a valuable lesson food challenges are a lot like life there's don't much pizza sometimes you get hit with unexpected surprises I feel like I'm 8,000 lb right now you kidding me [Music] dude no I just got to finish this pizza I was too terrified to even see who dm'd me but all I could do was prepare for the worst well everybody the last pizza's down but unfortunately I'm not  done I can't bring myself to even look at the DM I'll deal with it later I like my dessert for tonight's video to be a ridiculous amount of caramel pecan buns how many do you think it should be winky face emoji an hour later I was off to Cinnabon finally it was time for me to actually open up their DM I just got to do it all I got to say is shout out to saon the reply I got from cabon reminded me of an old saying those who expect the worst I love you Cinnabon can never be disappointed whoever said that sounds  very wise and everything but clearly they' have never had a pizza place in their DMS before thank goodness that is all finally over five large pizzas or 15 orders of crazy bread nope [Music]

AB162	https://youtu.be/Dkkb6got9v8?si=xylWyO4DMu_NU6W0	if I could recommend only one concept to learn from the psychology of motivation it would be Albert bandura's concept of self-efficacy self-efficacy helps explain many puzzles of our motivation why do we give up on our fitness plan even though we need to be healthier why do we waste time on our phones instead of studying when the exam date looms why do we sometimes feel excited to take on a new challenge but other times shrink away understanding self-efficacy can also help us build our motivation but to  appreciate the theory we need to take a step back and look an earlier simpler concept of motivation that self-efficacy was intended to correct rational expectations motivation for robots rational expectations was a prominent theory of motivation independently proposed by both Edward Tolman and Kurt Leen in the first half of the 20th century it proposes that our subjective feelings of motivation is an unconscious calculation of the benefits and costs we'd experience from taking an action so putting it mathematically motivation  equals benefits times their probability minus the costs now to use a concrete example according to rational expectations the motivation I feel for exercising would come from the benefit I expect to achieve getting in shape being healthier multiplied by the chance that exercising actually leads to those benefits minus the cost and of effort of actually sticking to my fitness program as implied by its name rational expectations are well rational this Theory suggests that whenever we don't feel motivated it's simply because we've  judged another option to be more valuable for us accordingly if we failed to exercise and sat around watching Netflix instead we valued keeping up on our shows more than having a beach body no mystery at all rational expectations isn't a terrible Theory it's probably a pretty good approximation of why we're motivated in many cases but it's also the kind of motivational theory we'd expect of a robot rather than a human being it assumes we perfectly weigh the options and always make the right choice  motivation for humans self-efficacy intervenes Albert bandura theorized that what was missing from rational expectations was an intervening step it isn't enough to have expectations about the outcomes of our actions we also must have expectations about our ability to take those actions so consider our exercising example again bandur argued it isn't enough to look at our expectations about the outcomes the chance that exercising will improve our fitness we must also examine our expectations about our ability to take  that action whether we believe we can actually stick to our exercise program rationally speaking we may have enough reason to justify the cost but we may be stuck with low motivation if our self-efficacy is low bandura articulated it in the following way the person to the behavior is a self-efficacy expectation can I take this action the behavior to the action is an outcome expectation will the action get what I want self-efficacy helps to explain why even when we want an outcome we may not work toward it for instance it's not  just our desire to graduate but our belief that we're capable of learning the material it's not just our desire to own a business but our belief that we can actually make it successful it's not just our desire to have a relationship but our belief that we can ask someone out without being rejected bandura's Theory improved on rational expectations because it argued that wanting an outcome isn't enough to motivate yourself to action you must also be confident in your ability to take the actions required to reach that outcome  common confusions about self-efficacy so before I explain some of the implications of self-efficacy I want to clarify what self-efficacy is not so self-efficacy is not self-esteem self-esteem is how you value yourself self-efficacy is your belief that you can succeed in taking a particular course of action so you can believe you're wonderful but also believe you're incapable of learning quantum mechanics the two are different self-efficacy is also not your self-concept self-concept is how you think about yourself  self-efficacy is how you think about your ability to perform a given set of actions finally self-efficacy is not just confidence as Albert bandur himself explains confidence is a non-descript term that refers to the strength of belief but does not necessarily specify what the certainty is about I can be supremely confident that I will fail at an Endeavor that is not self-efficacy so self-efficacy may be an academic Theory but we all have some experience with this concept we can recall situations  where we felt assured of our abilities and others where we seriously doubted we could succeed we know firsthand the consequences these beliefs have on our motivation bandura's contribution goes beyond merely labeling this common experience and suggests important implications for understanding our motivation what causes self-efficacy so bandura's research found that there are four major moderators the first two were weak moderators they could have small effects but they weren't reliable these were number one bodily arousal so think  of the sweaty palms and racing heart that accompanies stage fright or the queasiness that comes before a big exam these can make it harder to perform even if you otherwise would be able to in a relaxed state number two verbal pers uas so the crowd that cheers you on as you finish a race or a teacher telling you that you can do it simple affirmations that you can or can't do something can influence self-efficacy but the impact is unreliable in contrast to these weaker effects bandura identified two  more consistent sources of self-efficacy number one vicarious experience so witnessing someone perform the task increases your self-efficacy firstly this works by giving you a way to learn an effective strategy so if I watch solve a puzzle I can copy their approach to get the same result but there's also a motivational piece here if I see another person who's deeply afraid of spiders touch a tarantula I might also gain the courage to believe I can do it as well number two Personal Mastery personally experiencing success with a  task or something like it is the most powerful tool for improving self-efficacy I'll feel more confident if I can run a marathon after I've run a half marathon I'll feel more confident I can be a software developer after I've aced my intro programming class it's likely that people with strong self-efficacy and thus High degrees of motivation to work on ambitious goals have had plenty of both vicarious and Personal Mastery experiences nonobvious implications of self-efficacy so while the feeling of self-efficacy is  something we all know the implications of the theory are not always obvious here are a few important ciaries of this Theory number one motivation builds From Success so because Personal Mastery is crucial in building self-efficacy a long string of failures at the beginning of an Endeavor is more likely to demotivate than to build grit now does this mean that the best way to motivate is to only experience success well not quite as bandura himself put it performance accomplishments provide the most  Dependable source of efficacy expectations because they are based on one's own personal experiences success raises Mastery expectations and repeated failures lower them especially if mishaps occur early in the course of events after strong efficacy expectations are developed through repeated success the negative impact of occasional failures is likely to be reduced indeed occasional failures that are later overcome by determined effort can strengthen self-motivated persistence through experiencing that  even under the most difficult of obstacles they can be Mastered by sustained effort the effects of failure on personal efficacy therefore partly depend on timing and the total pattern of experiences in which they occur once established efficacy expectations tend to generalize to related situations so if you have low self-efficacy it helps to build a foundation of success once you've established to basic level of confidence mixing challenges with occasional setbacks will make that self-efficacy more robust you'll learn  that you can succeed even in the face of momentary difficulties number two The Confident spiral can go up or down the mathematics of self-efficacy form a positive feedback loop consider you have some self-efficacy which enables you to take action and achieve a result success from taking the action increases your self-efficacy next time you are even more motivated to take the previous action repeat eventually your motivation would Plateau at the level implied by the rational expectations Theory which  is one reason why even some tasks were supremely confident in like washing dishes don't Inspire ecstatic motivation conversely motivation can also crash as we experience lowered self-efficacy so you have some self-efficacy and take action but you fail to follow up or fully complete the action not achieving your desired result decreases your perceived self-efficacy next time you have less motivation to take the previous action repeat in this case the motivation spirals downward to Total inhibition to take the action the effect  is familiar to anyone who has tried and who pursued a few times stumbled experienced frustration and then found it difficult or even painful to attack the problem again low self-efficacy can become a trap that we find ourselves in number three learn from others succeed yourself self-efficacy was only a part of bandora's broader social learning theory in it he argued that most of what we know comes from other people and we learn how to do most things by witnessing the behavior of others not through our own trial and error and this  suggests a critical way to build self-efficacy is to closely study people who are successful in the pursuit that you care about see how they do it until you understand the actions they're taking and why their success isn't a mystery it's a logical outcome of a series of decisions they have made and the actions they have taken if you combine this careful study approach with taking the same actions yourself you're using the two most powerful levers bandura identified to increase your self-efficacy and thus your motivation  for working on challenging [Music] goals 
Y165	https://youtu.be/Ho9em79_0qg?si=ylTTE5KVpd_eucTw	- What's up party people? And welcome to  Yoga With Adriene. I'm Adriene and this is Benji and today we have an awesome practice for the hips  and the lower back body. So hop into something  comfy and let's get started. (upbeat music) Alrighty my friends, let's begin seated in your yoga mat with the legs  out in front of ya. You're gonna lift your knees, place your feet on the ground, try to aim your  toes pointing forward. Just to start to send some awareness towards your feet. And then you're  gonna take your hands  and you're gonna  touch your booty. So we're gonna move fleshy part of the buttocks to the side so that you can feel this grounding down through your sits bones. And if you don't feel it, that's okay. Just would be to each his own. Moving the buttocks  just so you feel grounded. So we have our feet grounded and then we have  the sits bones grounded. And then just notice if the knees are coming in or out. See if you can  align knees with ankles, so you have two  slides going down. Awesome, so we have  a swift practice today.  Swift is and not long so we're gonna jump  right in with the breath. Bring your hands  to your hamstrings. Just behind the  back to the thighs here. You're gonna  keep your feet rooted, loop your shoulders,  start to lift your heart up. Now, there is the likely chance that you've picked this video because you're experiencing some tension or some tightness in the lower back or hips so see if you can send awareness and breath, whatever that means to you, right down to that lower back right away here  as you breathe in.  And breathe out. Then in your next breath in, sit up a little taller, breathe in and then breathe out you're gonna slowly send your heart forward, chest forward. You're gonna drape over  the tops of your thighs. Now you might clasp  opposite elbow here. Notice if the knees are  wanting to come in or out. See if you can keep these two nice straight lines from the knees to the ankles,  toes pointing forward and then yep, you guessed it. Some of you are  probably already there, you're gonna relax  the weight of the head over  and still continue  with the breath. Ah, should feel really good. Notice where you might be  holding or clenching in the neck, the traps,  the shoulder area. The skin on  the forehead, the jaw, keep awareness in the toes. So keep that connection of the sits bones and your feet just kind of grounding  you into the moment. Take a moment to  close your eyes here. Just feel the power of your breath, that wave. Notice how it can  stretch as you breathe in and soften as you breathe out. And again,  if you haven't already,  go ahead and close your  eyes just for moment here, go inward. I love this shape. Doesn't always have  to be a fancy yoga pose. Just uniting breath and body. Sweet, take one more deep breath in your own private little love cave here. Nice, now release the hands, press the palms  firmly into the earth. Stay connected to everything that is touching  the ground here, your foundation as  you tuck the chin, start to lean back, way back, and slowly roll it up. Awesome, take a  deep breath in here. Head over heart,  heart over pelvis.  And then as you exhale, hands are gonna  come to behind the thighs. You're gonna lift the toes up, dig into the heels and if you're experiencing any pain or  discomfort in lower back, you're just gonna stay here. If you're here for more of the release and preventative care then you're gonna lean back and lift the shins and toes up parallel to the ceiling. Just connecting to  little core stability here. So we're here or we're  here and we're breathing deep. Jumping right in. Thank you so much for sharing your time and energy with me and  with the Yoga  With Adriene community. You made a great choice. Take one more breath, you got it. Awesome, then we're  gonna slowly release, feet back to the ground. Then you're gonna  send the left leg out long. You're gonna hug  the right knee in, squeeze as you send your sternum up  towards the sky. Flex your left toes, take a deep breath in and then on an exhale, you're gonna slowly bring  your right hand behind you and you're not  gonna twist to look back. You're just gonna  twist to look to the right.  So the right side of your mat, not all the way back. Just gentle and easy here. Big breath, squeeze and lift. Great, then you're  gonna come back to center. We're gonna bring the  right knee out this time. And then we're gonna  lift the right fingertips all the way up towards the sky. Left fingertips  brace behind you. Then you're gonna think up and over as you reach the left fingertips to either  grab the outer, sorry, right fingertips to grab the outer edge of your left foot or your left shin  or your left thigh.  So you could be here, here or here. Now actively draw the  top of the right thigh, that meaty quad muscle, and your thigh bone, the femur, down towards  the earth as you inhale, lift your chest. Lots of awareness. 100% full body awareness. Take a deep breath in. And then exhale,  you're gonna release your hand and then we're just gonna take  the hands to the earth, the shin or the foot and you're gonna come all the way flat, belly towards the thigh. Just intention not you  have to come all the way flat.  Head to knee pose,  take one more breath here. Big cycle of breath in and out. Breathing into that lower back body and then slowly release. Don't push anything. Just let it kind of be  where it's at today. And you're gonna guide  the right knee all the way up. And we'll just do a switcheroo. Send the right leg down, I'm not gonna lie guys, I'm on a little bit of  a cold medicine. Okay? Just got to keep it real. Right leg goes out, left leg comes in. Nothing better than a little at-home yoga to tend to the body  so I'm all good, don't worry. Not that you were worried. (laughs) Squeeze and lift so find this foundation first. Nice and tall,  hug that left knee in. And then again, we're  not going all the way back. Today, we're just  going to the left. So you'll bring the  left fingertips behind. This is to help us resist the urge of cranking  all the way back, creating stability  and finding length today. Big breath here,  breathe into your belly. Nice, and then slowly  we'll come back to center. We're gonna open  the left knee out.  Beautiful, then  left fingertips reach up. Got it right this time. Right fingertips come back to anchor you and then you're gonna think up and over as you reach towards the outer edge of the right thigh,  outer edge of the right shin, or all the way over to  outer edge of that right foot. And you're of course  gonna feel that great, long lengthy release  in the lower back body. And you know what  makes it even better? You bringing  conscious breath to the par-tay. So soften your gaze. Breathe deep.  Let your left thigh bone, left quad get really heavy here. So we're actively  drawing down as we lift and lengthen over the right leg. Awesome, then slowly release. Frame your right leg with your hands and then you'll decide what feels best here. Maybe grabbing the shin. Maybe one day the foot, maybe you're just here. Baby steps and we'll slowly  fall into our version of head to knee pose,  Janu Sirsasan. Hey buddy. Breathing deep. Then slowly press  into your foundation to roll up and look what Benji did. (laughs)  He loves to sit on top of people or on top of things. You think you're a lap dog. Okay, from here, from here we're gonna pull the right foot in to meet the left, Baddha Konasana but we're gonna give  ourself a lot of space today. So if you're used to kind of zipping up to the center line, awesome for you, my loves but we're gonna give  ourself a little space. You're gonna create a diamond shape by bringing the heels out. Then hands are gonna hold  on to the shins or the ankles so shins if you seem to  be rounding forward.  If you have that length already here then you can go ahead and go for the ankle and find a little rotation in the pelvis. Okay, inhale,  sit up nice and tall. Exhale, bend the elbows. You're just gonna slowly shift forward so that you're looking just beyond the toes. Maybe looking into a pond, seeing your reflection. And then we'll come  all the way back up. And then back again,  navel draws in and up, create space, coming forward, bend the elbows. And then come back up and then this is the last time we're  gonna hold there, and you might find that the option is available to allow the elbows to press the tops of the thighs out a little bit and  maybe open the toes. So we're breathing deep. Tops of the thighs  actively anchoring down. Ooh, yeah. This is a good one, tuck  the chin a little bit here. Find length. Nice, and then release. Bring the hands  to the outer edges of the thighs or the knees. You're gonna bring the knees together and then we're gonna send the legs out long. If the legs are a bit tight, lower back, hamstrings  a bit tight, just go ahead  and keep a nice generous bend in the knees by  digging into the heels. If you're able to straighten the legs let's go ahead and send the toes up towards the sky and keep nice and active in the toes. Check it out, left fingertips  are gonna go back. You're gonna slowly  reach all the way up and over, touch your right toes. Then come all the way back up. Left fingertips, I did it again. Right fingertips  are gonna go back, think up and over,  touch your left toes. Again, you can bend the  knees here for this flow.  Inhale to reach up and over. It's like you're  swimming here, big stroke. And then come back and  then all the way up and over. And you're gonna keep doing this and see if you can find a nice breath to sync up with. And this is definitely one where I like to remind you to not worry about what it  looks like but how it feels. Explore the sensations as you move with your breath. We'll go ahead and even it out. And then the next time you're in your Forward Fold with the knees bent or with the legs straight, with a micro-bend,  you're gonna go  ahead and hang out there, Paschimottanasana. I love to bend my  knees in Paschimottanasana. When I was younger, I really tried to get that peanut butter and jelly sandwich but I think I was straining my muscles a bit more then now I know that I would have wanted. (laughs) Whoever's doing the captions on this video, good luck with that one. No, just kidding. Basically, bend your knees. Because we're not just trying to get loose hamstrings. It's all connected, right? It's all tied in  to one moving part.  So we want to integrate. I'll stop talking for a second and I'll allow you to listen to the sound of your breath as you allow the weight  of the head to relax. And then take one more  breath in your private, beautiful,  therapeutic love cave. And then slowly grounding through your foundation to tuck the chin and roll  it all the way up. Okay, so how you get here will be a little bit different for everyone but I'm gonna  guide you to bend both knees and bring the feet  flat to the earth. Okay, so we're in this bit of an awkward pose to start but we're  gonna use our fingertips, we're gonna turn the toes out. This is very important. Turn your toes out, bring  your fingertips behind you, then here we go, lift  up from your pelvic floor, connect to your core and  you're gonna slowly come forward into a Froggy Pose. Knees are gonna trace the toes. A big hip opener here. Find soft, easy movement here. Notice if you got a little bit frustrated there, that's okay. That's why we're  here to create space one lovely at-home  yoga practice at a time. It's all good.  So create a  little movement here. You can stay in the Froggy Pose or you might widen your feet just a bit more,  drop your heels back and come into  this low yogi squat. A little Malasana variation. So you know your body best, you are the expert. So you can stay in  the Froggy or come here. Big full, deep breaths no matter what variation you're choosing. Again, try to think of  the body as one moving part. It's kind of why I've selected this little dance today so that we're not just going  isolating hip stretch.  Isolating back stretch. Even though this is  really great for the lower body. All of it, take one more breath. Maybe lean back  wherever you are. Sit up nice and tall. Yes, and then release  we're gonna lift the heels if you're in the squat. You're gonna  walk the toes back in. Knees are gonna  go forward, toes forward. Come to the center of your mat. And again, if you're  feeling sluggish today, just remember this  time is so awesome. You get to kick your shoes off and do yoga, right? You're not at work, yet.  Okay, then from here  toes pointing forward, fingertips on the  earth to support us, we're gonna slowly  drop the head down, drop the heels and  send the hips up high so you're in a  Standing Forward Fold. Allow the blood  to flush to the head. You can claps the elbows,  rock a little side to side. Now you have gravity  working for you here. So you might be able to straighten the  legs just a bit more. But careful not to lock them. And then really, oh,  take this time to release. Have you been holding on to or carrying around something heavy  that needs to be shed? No matter how big or how small, can you take a really conscious moment here to let go? Choose to release something that maybe is  just no longer needed. Maybe that's just tension  in the neck and shoulders or tightness in the hips. That's where we  store it all anyway. Oh yeah. If the arms are clasped, go ahead and  release the hands down. Now you're gonna walk your feet as wide as your yoga mat. Once again, turn the toes out. Inhale, use your  fingertips on the ground and exhale to support you.  Exhale, slowly drop your center back down into your Froggy or into your yogi squat. Take a deep breath in here, smile, life is good. Then exhale, you're gonna bring the fingertips behind you. We're gonna come all the way back sitting, seated. Awesome, send the legs out long. Sit up nice and tall. Beautiful Dandasana. Toes up towards the sky, breathing deep. Close your eyes, center. Nice and then  press into your hands, dig into your heels. You're gonna lift your hips up. Send 'em towards  the front of your mat  and come all  the way to your back. When you get there,  take a deep breath in. The deepest breath you've taken all day and as you exhale, hug your navel into your spine and hug the knees  up towards the chest. That's right, find  what feels good here. Give yourself a big hug. Roll around one  way and then the other. Let any sounds of gestures that want to come out of the body, (laughs) let them come out. Sigh of relief or release. Great, then you're gonna lower your left foot to the ground. And you're gonna cross your right leg over your left leg.  Now check it out, use the hands to press into the earth, you're gonna shift your hips over towards your right side of your mat, and then slowly just allow your legs to fall towards the left side of your mat. Now, if you're  experiencing any stress or tension in the lower back, you're gonna skip this and you're gonna come into maybe a more gentler twist. Make it an easy reclined twist. Knees just stacked  on top of each other. Otherwise we're in  the Garudasana legs-ish, Eagle Legs, breathing deep.  Soft fingertips. Send your breath downward. And then anchor  through your foundation to come all the way back up. Right foot comes to the earth as you re-center the spine and then left leg's gonna cross over. We're gonna use our  foundation to lift the hips up. Press down through the earth, lift the hips up, send the hips to the  left side of the mat. And then let this just  fall easy to the right. No pushing or forcing. Mmmm. And we're  breathing into the belly. You can close  your eyes on this one.  And then slowly press  into your foundation to come all the way back up to center. Take your hands,  bring them to your kneecaps. You might have to  peek at me for this one. We're gonna  stabilize a little bit, neutralize the spine by bringing the palms to the knees. You're gonna scoop  the tailbone up first so that it's nice and  flush with the mat. This should feel yummy and it requires you to be active. So you're gonna  scoop the tailbone up, draw the navel down. So there's no space between.  Breathe deep here,  try to soften through your feet. And then if this just feels amazing, you're just gonna stay here. Otherwise, we're gonna release and now slowly  allow the pelvis to tilt, the lower back to lift up. Just the opposite  of what we were doing. And again, you'll know if it's right for you to stay with your lower back flush with the mat. And if you do take the tilt,  you might come right on to that SI joint,  right on to the sacrum. Nice and easy. Soft in the feet, soft in the jaw.  Great, and then nice and slow, scoop the tailbone up. Hug the knees into the chest. Nice work, you're  gonna reach around. We're gonna end  with a Happy Baby. So you're gonna grab  the outer edges of the feet or the inner arches. I'll let yogi's  choice rule here. And then you're gonna  kick one leg then the other, soles of the feet actively kicking towards the sky. And now actively  reach your tailbone towards the front edge of your mat. Try to lift up  the lower back here. Breathe deep. If you want to some  soft easy movement here,  please do. (sighs) One more big breath in and out. And then we'll release. Awesome. Feet come  to the ground. You're gonna windshield wiper the legs one way and then the other to extend the  legs all the way out. Great, bring you left hand to your heart and your right  hand to your belly. We'll take a final breath here to just allow the nutrients of our practice to settle in. Go ahead and close your  eyes when you land here. Feel the warmth of your hands. Inhale, lots of love in. And exhale, lots of love out.  Nice work today. Go ahead and  leave behind anything that's not working for you,  not serving you. You can just leave it  on the yoga mat. It'll evaporate and transform into something new for someone. So just a little opportunity to release and leave behind whatever wasn't working so that you can plant new seeds, find new joy and  rock your best self. I want to rock  with you all night. (hums) Go ahead and bring your palms together. Tap into a little inner smile. Take a deep breath in and we finish by quietly whispering  Namaste. (upbeat music) 
AB165	https://youtu.be/i4Z7sHLnAro?si=lMZ9biaAh4PQaCRv	Raz Potter here Motivo Academy and in this video shot in January 2024 happy New Year it's dry January month I'm going to share with you my own story of not drinking alcohol for too solid years now and the positive effects that it's had on my life it's been quite remarkable actually the positive effects that not drinking alcohol has had on my life to give you a little bit of inspiration a little bit of motiv for your dry January really recommend not drinking for at least one month and I'm going to share my story with you  [Music] now so I'm now 2 years into not drinking alcohol and for you if you're doing a dry January you're thinking about doing a dry January again I want to try and give you some inspiration because the positive effects it's had on my life are are absolutely miraculous I have seen a transformation in my life since quitting alcohol I'm going to go through with you the top things that have happened first of all and then a little bit later on I'll give you the story about why I decided to quit drinking the backstory to this and  finally I'll tell you a few tips that are going to make it much much easier for you to continue the motivation to quit drinking hopefully once and for all so the number one thing that happened to me when I quit drinking was I lost a ton of weight straight off the bat if you're looking to lose a little bit of weight not drinking alcohol is a no brainer now what I noticed is and you can see a video here this is me before I quit drinking little bit inflamed right you can see that I'm a little bit puffy in  the face and this is me after as you can see now and you see me on screen right now and as you can see quite a lot thinner now a lot of that is not just body fat it's actually inflammation because alcohol is one of the most pro-inflammatory things you can stick in Your Body by none and by cutting out alcohol I had all of the benefits of reducing inflammation not only in my uh in my body but my my brain as well and we'll come on to that as one of the benefits very shortly but I lost a ton of weight noticeably so when I quit  alcohol it was work from home time I go into the office and people said to me have have you lost a load of weight and the answer is yes and all I had done was quit drinking I hadn't been doing anything else diet wise than I already had I already had a very healthy diet I already exercised almost every day but the quitting alcohol piece was absolutely huge in losing weight and that's the first benefit if you want to lose some pounds then uh I thoroughly recommend dry January and continue it as long as you can for losing some  weight so the second huge benefit of a dry January and For Me 2 years no drinking was I became more wealthy now previously I would have gone out to dinner really always going out to have a couple of beers under the guise of eating dinner and it adds up it gets expensive and EXP now is very high globally and I stopped going out so much and obviously not drinking alcohol and I saved a ton of money it was huge amount of money that I saved it was so nice to get to the end of the month look in my bank account and see that actually I  maintained most of my cash and this was this was huge but in addition to that what really surprised me was how much more financially successful I became in in my business in my day job in my training business Motivo Academy I became much more wealthy and successful and it was linked largely to having more energy which we'll talk about shortly having much less anxiety and low mood and having just being in a better place to attract clients to having more energy to be more productive to create things  it was transformational so not only did I spend less I actually produced a lot more and this increased my wealth significantly last year 2022 was probably the most successful year of my life financially in terms of all of my productivity really paying off deepening client relationships quite significantly being more engaged and this was largely linked to my mood being better and having more more energy and this was a real transformation and if if you're looking to increase your wealth I can absolutely recommend quitting  alcohol was transformational for me the third huge difference for me was better relationships much better relationships now backstory a little bit to why I quit drinking my partner noticed on the weekend she said you know what Russell you you go drinking during the week and I was never a heavy drinker I want to quickly say that I was never you know drinking you know bottles of wine of an evening it would just be a couple of times a week going out maybe with a group of friends drinking maybe three or  four beers you know pints of beer um other weeks just maybe two two pints of beer maybe twice a week never normally in a row but she said you know you go out drinking during the week and I see you on the weekend and you're mood is really low you're really moody and always ignored it until I tried not drinking for a little bit and she noticed now I hadn't told her but she said you know what your mood is much better and it was the drinking and what I had never realized was how subtle the change in  mood from just drinking two beer two pints of beer on a Thursday would have on my behavior and my mood and those around me ad weekend and it was profound now I grew up with an alcoholic mother so I never really thought that a couple of beers twice a week would be particularly you know that much of a problem but actually it was and it was noticeable and it had a transformational effect on my relationship and not just on that relationship but on all of my other relationships too because rather than going out drinking with mates I was  now inviting my friends who I wanted to stay in touch with for coffees instead coffees in the morning lunches these kind of things and the conversation was just more valuable much deeper much better conversations I was able to be present for my friends to give them the best of me rather than drunken rambling conversations and even if you know just on a couple of bits we might not think we're rambling I can tell you from not drinking and going out with friends who are drinking it's rambling make no  mistake it's low quity quality lowquality company and in addition the relationship with my son became better and I was more proud of it the self-respect of not drinking in front of my son even if it was a couple of beers demonstrated the kind of values that I wanted to espouse to my son and our relationship got a lot better and I hope he respects me a lot more as a result of not drinking in front of him and I'm a little bit ashamed that I drank in front of him ever to be honest with you cuz it's not the role model that I wanted to  be so relationships all around vastly better I can't I cannot State this enough and the respect that you gain from colleagues from friends from being a non-drinker from going out and not drinking and being a much better company is uh immeasurable I'll quickly Riff on that and tell you that one of the things that puts a lot of people off from quitting alcohol is the fear that if you go out and all your meats and drinking that you know you won't fit in I was really surprised how supportive friends  were about not drinking and actually I was very surprised how many other people wanted to quit drinking because we would go out for dinner in the evening and I'd say look I'm I'm not drinking at the moment please go ahead and they said actually you know what I don't want to drink either it was surprising how many people didn't really want to drink and uh felt that actually being around somebody who wasn't drinking was a was a great reason for them not to drink as well so you'd be surprised how many  people will join you in not drinking and uh that was another Revelation that I can share with you okay the fourth big thing is mornings uh were just easier they just got easier and easier and easier one of the reasons that I quit drinking as I was losing my memory I had about 2 or three weeks of just going out pretty much almost every day because friends were in town I live in Tokyo people like to travel here and come and see me and there was a lot of client stuff going on at the time and I was drinking quite a  lot quite frequently and I was starting to lose my memory now I have a genetic predisposition to dementia as I found out from a gene therapy test and for a gene test rather and I was a bit sensitive to it at the same time a science paper came out that had proven Beyond a doubt any reasonable doubt that more than two beers on an in an evening knocks out your brain cells and makes you more prone to dementia so I was very keen to slow down quit drinking if I could but I was very very aware of that while  I noticed when I quit drinking was my mornings were just a lot easier my energy level was much higher but my mornings were much easier and rather than having that bad yuana struggling through the morning oh it was a rough night last night wearing that like a badge of honor I actually switched completely to it was just much much easier in the morning my morning is now very productive I get up at about 5:30 in the morning cold shower uh do some exercise eat my first meal of the day do my second uh my first work set rather  and and uh then I might eat uh so I do my second work uh exercise set rather and then get my final meal in and that's all before 9:00 I could not have done that if I had been drinking the night before it would have been impossible but I got energy all day now but my mornings were just that much easier and uh the analogy I like to give on this is Imagine waking up shooting yourself in the foot and then trying to go and run Marathon how hard would that be and if you don't drink the thing that I personally found and gets even better  and better over time is that I just had more energy in the morning I felt sharper in the morning I just fantastic now I got great morning routine and I thoroughly recommend not drinking if you're a little bit foggy in the morning this will give you that little extra zip so riffing on that last point about feeling better in the morning is I generally have a lot more stamina now now previously I would feel foggy in the morning even if I hadn't been drinking the night before if I've been drinking even a couple of nights before I would  feel foggy in the morning my mood would be low I would still feel foggy and I would feel a bit tired towards the end of the day but what I found from not drinking certainly after just a month of not drinking is how much more stamina I have towards the end of the day as well and this helped me to be much more productive and it's not just about physical stamina is mental stamina as well not getting tired still feeling energized feeling very optimistic still feeling very empowered all the way through the day to create great things  to create videos to create training courses to go that extra mile to do the things that you know maybe you normally would procrastinate around that all faded off uh pretty quickly after not drinking so you'll get that extra zip and probably the reason is is that alcohol is a depressant it's a depress you've heard this hundreds of times but it is a depressant and it does have a significant effect on your brain we wrote about this in the book new energized you which I co-authored with Dr M Baler a neuros pychology in New  York and we looked at the research and it's pretty obvious that was the case and I not committed to quitting drinking after writing the book but it was always on my mind that I can't be hypocritical and uh continue to drink whilst I've given given this advice and man what an effect it had on my personal energy I cannot recommend it enough so that was a huge benefit so there were the five big benefits that I had to not drinking alcohol I want to give you a little bit of backstory about why I quit alcohol I  alluded to it before so I had a gene test done and you can get these things done you know pretty pretty cheaply these days and it showed that I was a candidate for early dementia I've got a certain couple of gene mutations which means I'm a candidate for early dementia but that doesn't mean that you're going to get dementia it means that if you the environmental conditions are in place then you you might well get you know that Gene expressed in that way so I was a bit cautious about things that might  impact Dimension at the same time I have a compressed heart because I have pectus excavatum presses my heart against my spine so I was also a little bit cautious about inflammation in the body and the more I learned about alcohol the more I realized that this this is something that causes uh inflammation in the body and uh therefore is also likely to impact Dem menure and was also likely to have a give me some problems in my heart as I mentioned as well starting to lose my memory um forgetting names just  forgetting simple things I'm feeling really foggy and it was pretty obvious I'm not I'm not at all guy I'm only 5' 7 in a bit and I found I was getting hangovers as well now I'm 48 years old I think 48 years old and I started to get hangovers as well and I realized my body was telling me something it was telling me alcohol doesn't agree with you and I should have known that because my mother was an alcoholic certainly didn't agree with her although she could not back a leader of V for a night but it clearly  didn't agree with her either so I probably have that Gene that means that I don't process alcohol so well and I read the signal to my body and I decided after as I said a couple of weeks of drinking quite heavily that I didn't want to do this anymore I needed to just do something about it the paper came out my girlfriend she mentioned to me hey you're quite Moody on the weekend and I thought I don't want to my relationship means more to me my relationships mean more to me than drinking alcohol let me  do this and uh and I committed to doing it from there and on and what I did is I made the promise out loud I said to her I promise you I will never drink again and I knew what I was doing in making that promise out loud I was making that promise out loud because Integrity is my most cherished value if I say I'm going to do something it's going to be done you better believe it and uh I Knew by promising it out loud I would never go back on that promise ever and that was so powerful that was an incredibly  powerful way to commit to not drinking and then I got all of the benefits that came with it so here were my top tips on what worked for me in maintaining this uh not drinking uh perod in my life which is forever there's no way I'll ever go back to drink it I can't believe I ever started to be honest with you after quitting alcohol but these are the things that really worked for me one was making that promise out loud to someone I care about very very much that was huge so by committing I didn't would  never want to make a promise then I go back on so that was number one the second thing which was quite interesting was to look to go to the internet and find out who doesn't drink which fous people don't drink because in our mind when we drink we think that we are the odd one out for not drinking and that is just not true at all you can see on screen right now some of the celebrities that um that don't drink alcohol that have quit alcohol and that gave me some motivation that you're not alone you're  not the only one who's not not drinking alcohol some of these people are people that I respect very much so that was uh that was huge and I kept that uh web page on on my phone as a as a page that was always open so whenever I went to my browser it was always there I could quickly say oh yeah so you know David Beckham he doesn't he someone I respect you know he doesn't drink alcohol and that gave me a feeling of uh of just you know motivation to continue so that was uh that was tip number one tip number two  was that I discovered that people are really supportive if you tell them I'm not drinking people are very very supportive and I got to say if you're around people who are going to try to make you drink or make you feel bad for not drinking they're probably not friends that you really want to keep around or you want to switch the Forum where you meet those friends to coffees or lunches instead you will have drinking friends without question you know that's how these things work some people who take  drugs have drug friends people who drink tend to have drinking buddies and so on but you'll find that switching it over to coffees to breakfast to lunches instead you will realize who are really good friends that will support you in your success and who are really not but what I found was is that there was absolutely nobody in my life who said Russell that's a really bad idea or why are you doing that in a condescending way I was surprised how many people wanted to quit alcohol as well how many  people wanted to join me in not drinking on an evening out and how easy it actually was in regards to peer pressure uh to not drink so I think people will support you and uh if they don't support you they're probably not friends that you should keep the other thing that I learned is the positive Cascade of changes in my life and probably the most profound change was self-respect self-respect and the Cascade that comes from self-respect if you quit drinking as I quit drinking I was then very very  conscious about all of the toxin that I was pulling into my body I obvously didn't want to replace alcohol with another toxin alcohol is basically a poison and a depressant at that and I didn't want to replace it with another poison so suddenly as I was more conscious of that my diet became almost exclusively organic I was eating only organic vegetables I was trying to Source grass fed Meats which is both of which you should do anyway but I was more conscious of what I was eating then I quit sugar I cut out all sugars I  have a complete sugar I have a complete sugar addiction without question I would crave cookie in the morning just as I would crave a beer at about 4:00 in the afternoon early sence of uh alcoholism and addiction but I would crave sugar and I quit sugar and because I had quit alcohol it was easy to also go through the same prod of quinning sugar as well I'm now on a ketogenic diet lost even more weight I've never felt healthier in my life my skin is just better I've lost a ton of weight even more energy than I  had before I'm not recommending a keto diet it's not my job to give you diet advice on these kind of things work with your doctor on that kind of stuff but uh what I can say is the cascading effect the positive effects and how that radiated throughout my certainly my dietary uh intake was profound and that in turn has had a a big effect on my mood because ketogenic diet has a big effect on your mood makes your mood more stable I feel great I've never felt better in my life I I probably am feeling younger than I felt in many many  years as well so it has a real positive Cascade of uh of other benefits on my life not least self-respect respecting my body with what I put into it having more willpower um that I've proven through quitting drinking quitting sugar that radiates throughout your life so that's been a really really positive effect from not drinking alcohol if you're looking to quit drinking in this dry January or whenever you're watching this video you can start any time of year and I thoroughly recommend doing it as I pointed out in  this video but I think it's important to be mindful of how how subtle the effects the negative effects of drinking are on your life it's very easy to ignore the effects or not see the effects that it's actually having on relationships because if you're a serious alcoholic and you know you're disruptive you know you're violent or you're coming home really drunk and obnoxious all the time the effects are really obvious and you know people are going to mention to you at some point you might lose a relationship but from  moderate drinking the effects on your mood are incredibly subtle people not noticeable enough for necessarily people to point things out but the effect that it has on your energy levels on your relationships around you because you're in a low mood and a bit depressive and uh maybe focus on negative things is actually profound but people might necessarily know it they might just see it as your personality the other subtle thing is how addiction can creep up on you and what I found is about 4:00 5 in the afternoon I would  really want a beer I would really want a beer and that's called the fantasy of drinking and in the addiction in the addiction cycle there is a stage called the fantasy of drinking so basically the fantasy of drinking uh consuming alcohol then maybe doing something wrong getting a bad hangover missing a day at work promising never to drink again you know we've all been there right I'll never drink again uh the regret phase and then the fantasy of drinking phase once again and that regret phase for alcoholics is  the only phase where alcoholics generally seek treatment and that can be 20 minutes a 20- minute window with the you know the parents call up the drug and alcohol rehab Clinic say he's upstairs you know he said he would go to a drug and alcohol recap clinic or it could be a couple of days but that will be followed eventually by the fantasy of drinking unless you get treatment for it so that cycle starts obviously very low that's an extreme cycle that I just uh just uh mentioned but to be very just to  the recommendation to the people on this channel people watching this video be very mindful of where you're fantasizing about drinking about going out and having that beer just be very very mindful that that is the early stages of addiction and I think a lot of people that I speak to say I couldn't quit drinking I just can't imagine it I need that glass of wine at the end of the day that subtly even though it's socially acceptable and you know it's a badge of honor and yeah I have a glass of wine or  beer at the end of the day is actually very subtly the early stages of addiction for many many people so be mindful of the subt y of how alcohol dependence can creep up on you I don't want to make you feel bad or frightened but I do recommend that you give abstinence at least for a month a try see if it works for you look for the positive benefits because the Motivo Academy is all about helping good people do great things I care very very very much about the people on my channel the subscribers to my channel most of you  have

The oral nicotine product comes in these cans. You may have seen them for sale in convenience stores, gas stations, and even your local pharmacy, or on social media where they've birthed a devoted subculture. - Good morning, boys. Popping a little. - [Alexander] Over the past year,  sales of ZYN have skyrocketed. In the fourth quarter of 2023, 116 million cans were sold in the US, a 78% increase over the same period a year earlier. - ZYN is definitely having a moment. - A pouch packed with problems, - [Alexander] But ZYN's remarkable success has provoked a backlash, and thrust it into the culture war. - Many people see it as a threat. - [Alexander] So what can we learn about ZYN when we test it in a lab, and how transformative a product could ZYN be for the tobacco industry?  (rhythmic music) - Today we're gonna be finding out what's in ZYN. - [Alexander] Ben Katz is an analytical chemist at UC Irvine specializing in mass spectrometry. Outside of his university work, Katz has been testing nicotine pouch products, - [Influencer] What's in the pouch? Spearmint Edition. - [Alexander] And sharing the findings on his TikTok channel, Mass Spec Everything. - Now we're gonna test a Chill, the Winter Green. - [Alexander] Today, Katz is testing six different ZYN flavors. (rhythmic music)  - Alright, so now we're gonna be analyzing the samples on the mass spectrometer. A mass spectrometer is capable of weighing the exact mass of a molecule so that you can determine the composition of the chemical structure and identify what is in a sample. Oh, it works! In the data analysis software, we see a series of peaks. There is a common peak that's in all of the samples, and it's the most abundant peak in all the samples that is our nicotine peak. Based on these tests, nicotine is the bioactive molecule in ZYN,  and the nicotine is the only tobacco-related alkaloid that we can see in this product. - ZYN looks like a little teabag. It's a tiny little white pouch that tucks inside the cheek and inside, there's no tobacco leaf. There is cellulose or wood pulp, along with some artificial sweeteners, and flavorings, and nicotine. - [Alexander] In January, Senator Chuck Schumer called for a federal crackdown on the pouches. - I'm delivering a warning to parents because these nicotine pouches seem to lock their sights on young kids,  teenagers, and even lower, and then use the social media to hook 'em. - [Alexander] This scrutiny has in turn triggered another chapter in America's cultural war with some on the Right declaring a ZYNsurrection Senator Thom Tillis responded on X with a message that said, "Come and take it, Chuck." - So we're gonna make him a ZYN birthday cake. - [Alexander] Fueling ZYN's rise are self-styled Zynfluencers who feature the nicotine pouches in their social media content. ♪ Upper-decky gum pilly's, upper-decky lip cushions. ♪  - [Alexander] Unlike cigarette brands, nicotine pouch brands are permitted to advertise on billboards and television. And unlike E-cigarettes such as JUUL, they're sold in fruity flavors. There are lots of brands of pouches on the market, including Rogue, VELO, and LUCY, but it's ZYN that is emerged as the Kleenex of nicotine pouches. - ZYN is sold by Swedish Match, a Swedish smokeless tobacco company. - [Alexander] In 2022, tobacco giant, Philip Morris International acquired Swedish Match in a $16 billion deal.  Just last year, Philip Morris shipped 385 million ZYN cans in the US, and this year, the company forecasts shipment volumes of about 520 million cans. ZYN now represents 24% of the smokeless category, which includes traditional smokeless tobacco such as Copenhagen, Grizzly, and Skoal. - Nicotine pouches are still in their early days in terms of their share of the overall tobacco market. They still would have a long, long way to go to really take a bite out of cigarettes. - [Alexander] Despite the brand's success,  ZYN's unofficial brand ambassadors have created a headache for ZYN's owner Philip Morris. - The most famous Zynfluencers is Tucker Carlson, the former Fox News host. - ZYN is not a sin. - He is sort of a self-appointed and unofficial ZYN brand spokesman. - [Alexander] In October, Tucker Carlson made unfounded claims that ZYN helps with focus and erectile dysfunction. - ZYN is a powerful work enhancer, and also a male enhancer, if you know what I mean. - Philip Morris has pushed back very hard on these claims,  and has actually sort of asked his team to cease and desist on that. - [Alexander] Philip Morris said, "It has reached out to social media influencers, asking them not to promote ZYN in any form, but the audience includes people under 21." The company said, "Its products are intended for adults who already use nicotine. - Senator Schumer's interest in ZYN, I think is related to his long-standing interest in tobacco control, especially the risk to youths. However, the national data, survey data tells us  that kids are not really using this product at significantly high levels, so there's not really evidence for any kind of epidemic. - [Alexander] A 2023 study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that around 1.5% of middle school and high school students reported using nicotine pouches in the last 30 days. Some public health experts say, "Nicotine pouches like ZYN could save lives by helping adult cigarette smokers switch to a much safer alternative." - Would I consider, you know, recommending ZYN  to friends or family that smoked cigarettes? Yes, I would. We know that smoking is bad, bad, bad for you. - Anecdotally, I've heard from E-cigarette users who have switched over to ZYN, it's very, very hard to detect that someone has a nicotine pouch in their mouth. I've done interviews with folks who would talk to me for half an hour, and I never noticed until at the end of the interview, they would take the pouch out. - [Alexander] According to the FDA, "Nicotine is addictive, but by itself, it doesn't cause cancer or lung disease."  - But we don't really, you know, 100% know what the long-term effects of nicotine use are. However, we do have some pretty good indications from evidence that comes from other parts of the world. So, for example, the country of Sweden is famous for using a product called Swedish Snus. - [Alexander] Snus is a moist, pasteurized, smokeless, oral tobacco product, which is placed under the lip to deliver nicotine through the gums. It's been used by consumers in Sweden since the 1970s. - And this is a product  that's in some ways is similar to ZYN, it's actually the precursor to ZYN, and it's known to be much less toxic compared to other oral tobacco products. - [Alexander] Since Snus pouches were first introduced in Sweden in 1973, smoking rates have fallen considerably. - Sweden now has the lowest smoking rate of all of the European Union countries. They also now have the lowest rates of smoking-related cancer. So that tells me that people who use clean nicotine products are much less likely to develop serious diseases  that we know are related to smoking. - So Schumer asked the FDA to investigate, and the FDA already has been conducting a review of ZYN because all nicotine pouch manufacturers were required to submit their products for FDA review in order to get authorization to keep them on the US market. - [Alexander] If the agency does authorize a nicotine pouch, the authorization might come with marketing and flavor restrictions.

D168	https://youtu.be/G082dLoMsCA?si=5NVPd2eNkv-c_o7l	let me get into this mess cuz Courtney Kardashian has found herself getting called out for the Vitamin and supplement line that she launched back in 2022 called lemi the gummy supplements are vegan gluten-free and non-GMO the products are free of artificial sweetener synthetic colors and sugar alcohols and come without corn syrup glucose syrup gelatin or palm oil but recently one Tik Tok user has called out the brand after doing some research and after explaining what's in these gummies the Commons have been calling  out lemy for just being elevated candy with little to no effects the brand offers several products at the moment you can even bundle the products but they have a sleep gummy one that claims to be a fat burner one for your hoo-ha a de bloater gummies for your hair skin and Nails a gummy for energy one to be chill one to be focused they sell a prenatal and a glucose and craving support capsule and several of the gummies also do come in capsule form as well so they have a lot going on here and all the products range from $25 to  $40 and Courtney in the past has faced some backlash I've talked about this one before but when she released ly purr she was met with a lot of comments about it because this product is designed for yuha if you know what I mean and gynecologists were posting on social media warning people not to purchase this product and saying it's wrong of her to be spreading the message that people need to change the taste or the smell of the privates people were commenting all over her Instagram and L's Instagram at the time saying that  she needs to stop pushing this toxic message and making people feel insecure like there's something that they need to fix about themselves and if someone really thinks there is something wrong they need to go to the doctor and not look towards Courtney Kardashian for advice on their hooa but the product Still Remains on their website over a year later so clearly the backlash wasn't getting to them but now they found themselves in some more hot water with the effectiveness of these products despite the fact that the website even  promises real results from their gummies now the thing about lemi is that the marketing has been on point for this brand they really have been pushing this brand out to be this effective C and aesthetic vitamin and supplement company they have a ton of advertisements done on Tik Tok Instagram all catering to a young audience who seem to want to try what Courtney has to offer they're also sold in a ton of places such as Ulta Amazon Target they're even sold on revolve their campaigns are colorful and  fun and certainly trying to catch the attention of potential consumers and people have been praising how they've been doing things in this department let me the brand by Courtney Kardashian do the best emails that I have seen in years the flow the Aesthetics it's just it's Perfection so whoever is behind all of this is stunning I love talking about marketing done right and lemy by Courtney Kardashian really is done right when you go to the site first there's an email popup to get your information and then The Branding on the  website is just chef's kiss it's all ada8 compliant it's simple but it's fun and it's a pop of color that grabs attention the hierarchy of information on the website is great it quickly goes into the products first of all we have to start with this insane custom packaging The Rim the little divots in the rim that have to be custom made for limi and then the top looking like the vitamin the way that's going to stand out on a shelf and differentiate itself from the competitors is insane but definitely my favorite part is the name  the way that the limie chill the let me Focus the way that is used into every single product is really genius like when you go to their website it's like let me get real results and they use it in every single aspect of their brain they launch a new product let me glow let me burn the brand has also gotten a lot of praise for simplifying what each vitamin or supplement is supposed to do like instead of saying that there's melatonin in the product they're calling it let me sleep which is the function  the product is supposed to help with marketing the product in a much simpler way which people are saying just grabs the attention of people that are walking through the store or shopping online okay let me tell you why I'm obsessed with the product packaging for Courtney Kardashian's brand ly so I work in a cpg space in brand and strategy so I pay really close attention to Brands product and packaging so in marketing there's this concept of jobs to be done which essentially means to understand customer  motivations you need to understand what job they'd be hiring your brand to do for them so for example if you go to the store and you buy this Nature's made melatonin you're not hiring Nature's made to give you melatonin you're hiring them to help you sleep so in 2014 when Oli vitamins was founded they really disrupted the vitamin and supplement category because they instead of marketing it as the functional ingredient they marketed it as the job that you were hiring them to do so instead of melatonin it was sleep it  went on to be acquired by Unilever for what I assume is probably a lot of money but the lesson here is what ly is doing is essentially taking a winning Playbook written by Ali and just modernizing it for a new audience they're clearly communicating the occasion or job on the front of the package they're using language that resonates with a female audience like let me purr and these bottles are so gorgeous it actually looks like something you'd want to put on your countertop and I must say the packaging for this brand is aesthetic I  mean it looks nice it looks expensive but it sounds like what you're paying for is really the bottle and the gummy like the whole design of everything that's going on here is really what you're paying for and not the actual product that you are consuming because to get into the criticism this brand has gotten it all started when the account B better company started posting on Tik Tok making a video exposing lemi this creator has been examining tons of influencers and their careers on their page and this time it was lem's turn in  the beginning he said he was actually going to do a video about how great the marketing has been for this brand but things took a turn when he actually started looking into the ingredients of the products and quickly his opinion on the company changed and he wanted to warn others what he had found I have a master's degree in Botanical medicine and today I'm going to use it to expose why this brand by Courtney kashian is one of the biggest scams I have seen in the sub supplement industry in a very  very long time I was so excited to talk about this brand and to finally talk about something positive on my page imagine my shock and my disappointment when I actually read the ingredients and did a deep dive on some of these more specific so initially I went to try the matcha because I love matcha and this was my first red flag for those of you that can't see it's essentially the same size as a Skittle so for me this was a red flag because I know as somebody that literally has done manufacturing for  these types of supplements before there's only so much room where you can fit in these medicinal ingredients into this tiny little Gummy because the vast majority of these gummies need to be other things they need to be natural flavor sometimes gelatin and sugar and all these different things which is typically why high-end high quality supplements are in capsules and not made into gummies because you have to compromise essentially the efficacious dosing that you need to get the results that you want so then I decided to read  a little bit more into it and I was extremely honestly shocked to see that Courtney Kardashian is engaging in something called proprietary Blends so for those of you that don't know this is very important so stick with me proprietary Blends are essentially when supplement companies will tell you there's 100 mg of these three ingredients in our product but they don't tell you the breakdown of how much of each ingredient is going into it so this to me is extremely unethical it's very dishonest I will never consume  a supplement that has proprietary Blends because as a consumer it's relevant to me if you are advertising a product that's going to be helping my health I deserve to know the actual breakdown so just to give you like an example it would be like if I was selling you a bag and I said hi I'm going to sell you a bag it has gold in it it has diamonds and it has wrap poop and it's 10 lb so it's going to be great but I'm not going to tell you how much gold how much diamonds and how much rat poop all you  know is that it's 10 lb of something in here would you buy that bag for me or would you be skeptical that me trying to make money is secretly putting 99% rat poop he goes on to talk about how proprietary Blends are not something that any supplement company should be engaging in and what he's talking about just sounds like a company that's trying to cut Corners if you go on the lemi website to actually investigate the ingredients label you can see when you look at lem's sleep gummy that it says that they have 25 Mig of this  proprietary herbal blend so what he's bringing up is that you don't know how much of the chamomile Elderberry or Lavender is exactly in these gummies and this wasn't even the only one of his concerns this was just the first one that he had with the product the next problem and I have let me chill here we have lemon bomb passion flour and goji berry so in total that's 15 Mig for those of you that don't know 15 mg is an absolutely negligent amount of Botanicals that will have absolutely no effect on you whatsoever it's BS I'm  sorry I'm getting mad because this is really one of my biggest passions so that's extremely frustrating to me and just to illustrate this even further because I'm a little bit Petty today I wasn't able to get my hands on let me sleep because it was sold out it's the same thing it's a proprietary blend so I can't tell you how much of each ingredient there is but can make an educated assumption that it's probably evenly distributed so let's just assume that in let me sleep it's 5 Mig of chamomile would you like to see what 5  migs of chamomile is there you go I don't know if you can really even see I don't even know if this is like illustrating how small this is like compare it to a Skittle that's what you're getting that is what you're paying $50 for it's absurd absurd so not only are you lying about the ingredients but you advertising something that isn't actually going to have an effective result he also wanted to address the fact that people have said these products have worked for them which I will say I too have seen a lot  of people say they tried let me and either can't live without it now or just have really positive things to say about it and I've seen these comments just on random Tik toks that were not paid for and so clearly he has seen it too and wanted to bring this up in addressing why this might happen I know people are going to say let me sleep work for me it helped me sleep that's cuz it has a crap ton of melatonin in it first of all there's two reasons why that's happening the first would be the placebo effect  because let's be honest it is in a beautiful package and it's a nice experience so that's going to enhance the placebo effect and so is other people's explanations if you saw a review of IT where someone's like it knocked me out psychologically that's sort of suggested to your subconscious mind that that's going to be the effect you're going to experience and the next reason is that it's encapsulated in sugar sugar glucose does have an ability to drive active ingredients into the cell in the end he  also just calls out how the brand doesn't align with Courtney at all because her whole Persona on their reality show is that she's always talking about how she doesn't want to consume any sugar everything has to be sugar-free she wants to be healthy she doesn't want her kids to have any candy or sugar but her products are made with sugar which makes it really hard to believe that she would actually use her own product because consuming more than one gummy would equal out to be a lot of sugar the  whole personal brand of Courtney Kardashian being sugar- free sugar- free gluten free WiFi free and then for you to have such a high sugar product was shocking to me before I bought these I had assumed it was going to be made out of stevia or something or or really anything other than cane sugar it's cane sugar so the reason that I really don't believe that Courtney Kardashian even consumes these products is that if it it was true and every morning she woke up and she took the serving size which is  two gummies out of all 10 of these products that she sells that would be like 30 g of sugar right in the morning I mean in hearing all of this can one really be surprised no honestly I'm more surprised to hear that the brand has been selling out and that it's in all these stores and people have said that it's worked for them obviously their marketing has been killing it and they've been doing exactly what they've been hired to do but seriously for the price of these gummies and hearing that they are edly hardly doing anything for  people it sounds more like what he's described in the comments as premium Welter gummies but I want to know what you guys think about this whole thing have you tried out lemie due to all the hype and fancy advertisements and what do you think about what has been exposed about leemy let me know all of your thoughts in the comments I love you guys so much and I will talk to you in the next video bye [Music] guys [Music] a 
S168	https://youtu.be/HmEo6RI4Wvs?si=t4R9O4dI_rs-pCGk	[Music] mindfulness is actually a way of connecting with your life uh and it's something that uh doesn't involve a lot of energy it involves uh kind of uh cultivating attention in a particular way so what the way I Define it is it's paying attention on purpose in the present moment non-judging mentally and then I like to add sometimes as if your life depended on it because it does uh attention is the faculty that allows us to navigate our lives in one way or another and to actually know what's happening or know that we don't know  what's happening and find ways to be in U a wiser relationship to things that are going on in our lives than than being at the mercy say of our own emotional reactions and crazy thoughts and uh fears and so forth so uh it's paying attention on purpose in the present moment non-judgmentally uh as if your life dependent on it so paying attention to what you might ask well it doesn't actually matter it's paying it's the attending itself that's important more important than what it is that you're paying attention to but that said um if  you start to pay attention to how much attention we pay to anything you begin to notice that the mind is all over the place it never sits still it's got this idea and that opinion and this reaction and we spend a huge amount of time um planning and worrying about the future and a huge amount of time reminiscing about the past and who did what to whom or why it worked out this way or why it didn't work out this way and the present moment which is the only time that we're ever alive in the only time we could  learn anything express any kind of love or emotion the only time we could be in our own body the only time we can see or hear or smell or taste or touch or uh communicate is now and yet the present moment gets completely squeezed out by all of our preoccupation with the future and the past when we start to pay attention to our own mind and our own body it's like reclaiming your life mindfulness is not a technique uh although there are many many different ways to cultivate mindfulness it's actually a way of being being embodied  being in some sense in equilibrium with the comings and goings of the outer world and even the comings and goings and the ups and downs of having a body which of course has its wonders and is also at sometimes seriously problematic when we're dealing with health problems of one kind or another or uh things that can happen to the body and as long as we have this capacity for awareness why not develop it much of the time if you think about our educational system and how we grow up we are trained more and more and  more to get into thinking and thinking is wonderful stuff very powerful uh some of the you know greatest uh achievements of humanity come out of thought uh and out of imagination and out of creativity but the other piece of it that's equally as powerful uh as the capacity for thought is the capacity for awareness but we get no training in awareness and attention huge amount of training in thought so a lot of the time when we get into bed at the end of a long day we can't deal with our thoughts then we  can't sleep they just kind of perseverate over and over and over again the same thoughts we want to shut them out the more you try to shut them out the more they come in and pretty soon you don't get to sleep or you wind up with a you know basically chronic anxiety or some kind of condition or other uh depressive rumination can spiral you into uh depression uh a little bit of sadness and then that triggers this kind of perseverating constantly what's wrong with me why don't people like me why didn't she look  at me whatever it is these are all thoughts I'm no good I'm too old I you know my life is it's all downhill from here all of those things they're only thoughts but most of the time we think of them as the truth so what mindfulness does in a way is it Embraces the actuality of the Mind the heart the body and our relationality with the outer world and gives us new degrees of freedom to navigate the ups and the downs and the ins and outs of our relationships with life with other people with uh our own aspirations and  our own fears and also and most fundamentally with our own body now most of us don't want to go anywhere near our own body except under very specialized circumstances at particular times it seems like wow it's wonderful to have these bodily experiences but a lot of the time we're just pretty much up here thinking thinking thinking thinking and really be believing so many of these thoughts as the truth that we wind up in a very narrow band of what's actually possible for us in terms of our Human  Experience [Music]

endless stream of sponsorships so how could a life filled with such success end up becoming one of YouTube's worst tragedies not just for M Skillets but innocent people around him popular YouTuber was behind the wheel of a pricey sports car that sped into oncoming traffic three people were killed and eight injured in a 100 mph car accident slams head on into 4  3-year-old eileene pizaro and her daughter Ariana killing them he confessed to his mother that he drove his sports car at 150 M an hour in a 25 mph Zone he also told his father that he was invincible saying quote neither the police nor the bullets could hurt him hi I'm the internet Anarchist I create weekly YouTube documentaries and today we'll be looking into the tragic story of one of the most infamous YouTubers on the platform Mick Skillet will examine his start in the csgo community the creation of the business that  brought him Millions at the age of 18 and how a rapid mental decline led him on a murderous Rampage not just taking his own life but a beloved mother and daughter on the 14th of February 2014 a 15-year-old boy by the name of Trevor heightman from San Diego California logged on to YouTube and

effective MC Skillet gathered information on the most desirable skins in his favorite computer game Counter-Strike Global Offensive and discussed his findings with relevant gameplay in the background at the time getting specific information on the emerging scin economy would require digging through countless Forum posts  but MC Skillet was presenting it on a silver platter although he didn't have the best editing or voice over work the informative value he provided was good enough to keep viewers engaged so good in fact that the video gained hundreds of thousands of views on release and later crossed 1 million views not even a week later he would follow up the video with another that covered csgo's many underrated skins although the video didn't have the same level of virality as its predecessor it still showed  promise it would take several more uploads to gain consistent viewership but by his third month on YouTube YouTube Millet was getting hundreds of thousands of views per video he also experimented with other video formats like his trade-up videos and inventory reviews all of which further bolstered his growth M Skillet had successfully identified an untapped Niche and was about to reap the rewards of his Discovery to understand why M Skillet csgo videos were more captivating compared to other video game guides you  first have to understand the CSCO skin economy how it worked what it offered players and why it was rapidly becoming a billion doll IND industry the roots of the csgo skin economy can be traced back to the 14th of August 2013 with the arm update that added skins to the game and allowed players to freely trade these skins amongst themselves on the steam Marketplace skins in csgo are purely cosmetic and had no gameplay advantages to the players who acquire them this left the main driving forces behind csgo  skins to be their customization opportunities and social implications of having a unique weapon design although the game was only averaging less than 20,000 players which is incredibly small for an online shooter the armd update completely revived interest in CS goo new players steadily flocked to the game to Trail these skins and trade them with other players by July of 2014 csgo's average player numbers quadrupled players began doing more than just trading and began buying and selling these Cosmetics for real world currency  this was a huge shift in the csgo community as these digital items now had real world value skins that were easy to obtain only fetched a few dollars while the more rare rare ones went for thousands naturally different online businesses popped up to take advantage of this Emerging Market case opening sites that gave the illusion of winning rare skins skin gambling or betting sites that used skins as a currency and marketplaces that allowed their players to exchange CS go items for dollars were the main businesses that attempted to  make money of the csgo community six figure sums were being spent on these platforms daily and the amount was only going to increase with millions of dollars on the line several Bad actors began to surface and many of these websites were outed as scams that prayed on players that had a few worthwhile skins but didn't have the knowledge to make the most of them there was a large portion of new players that didn't understand how skin trading worked but had a deep desire to profit from it the players that traded skins along with the  plethora of businesses that attempted to profit from them quickly formed a literal billion doll virtual economy and Millet was quickly becoming a notable figure in that economy by the 17th of August 2015 Millet released his 100K subscriber special which gave fans an insight into why it was growing so fast on the platform what's going on guys M Skillet here with another video and today I'm going to be doing a commentary basically talking about my road to 100,000 subscribers on YouTube which is pretty insane because usually when you  hear someone that has over 100,000 subscribers on YouTube you think they've been on YouTube for like a couple years but I've only been on YouTube for 3 and 1/2 months and my I've managed to go from Z to 100K Subs in that short of a time and the crazy thing is I didn't even like advertise my videos anywhere I just posted them posted them to YouTube and they pretty much blew up after a bit and I'm pretty much going to be telling the whole story from 0 to 100K Subs um in this video Millet went on to explain  the strategy behind this first video his growth from Gaining Zero Subs a day to thousands a day and even gave viewers tips on how they could succeed on YouTube as well so um if you if you're just making gameplay videos you should shouldn't be expecting your channel to really get anywhere unless they're really funny videos or if you like post them on Reddit or something and people find them really funny but um otherwise if you're just relying on search you can't really just do gameplay or funny videos you have to do something that is  interesting and people will search for and um isn't really there isn't like a lot of other videos on that which is really hard to find videos like that you can make because of how many videos there are on YouTube but that's pretty much the best advice I can give you guys comments on the video only reinfor lost Miller's points on why he was going viral it only took a mere 6 months for millet to Triple his sub count and celebrate his 300K special this video had marked the first time Mi Skillet accepted a sponsor from a csgo website  csgo wild it only made sense for a channel that size to have a sponsorship but the Shady reputation of most csgo gambling websites was putting his reputation on the line as well fortunately Millet limited his association with these websites and didn't make the same mistakes as other csgo YouTubers who often promoted scams with that being said there were instances of controversy throughout his career such as allegations of price manipulation after an April Fool's video drastically shifted the price of a gun  we're going to be taking a look at the new update and I haven't tested this out yet but apparently according to the change log or the release notes for the latest patch they've actually made it so you can trade up covert skins and get a knife so you take 10 covert skins or 10 Red Skins and you actually can get a random knife so this is pretty crazy I'm guessing this is going to change the entire csgo economy oh my God or chameleon went from $2 to $5 from kids trying this out and when he was forced  to delete a video of him making fun of case opening websites due to community backlash but Mill's biggest controversy actually happened after he returned from this break in late October 2016 Mill released a video that essentially took a massive dump on case opening sites and labeled them as a scam now this video is also now deleted largely because it upset a lot of other YouTubers and not just because some of them were sponsored by the sites that milled attacked it was also because shortly after M skilled  made that video he started promoting CSG go roll a gambling site the thing he's doing it's basically like saying like this okay guys so uh um I really I really hate milk guys I really don't yeah like all the milk you're drinking it's so bad the milk you're drinking actually scams you and now 3 weeks later I'll be like okay but I I make my own milk now yeah there was a pretty valid charge of rank hypocrisy here although Millet does appear to have learned from it and generally kept himself out of this sort  of stuff afterwards besides that Millet enjoyed a relatively drama-free career often taking a less confrontational approach as seen with his falling out with leafy minimal drama and a solid reputation gave M Skillet the chance to Branch off into other Ventures he started his first two csgo gambling websites skin. trade in January of 2017 and csgo Kingdom in July the same year the two projects were profitable for a while but were eventually taken down however his third attempt in November of the same year was by far his best with  the introduction of csgo magic he had already built an audience of 700k subscribers that was extremely interested in making money from csgo skins and now he had a proper way to monetize that audience Millet was about to experience a growth in Revenue like he'd never seen before whilst the exact Revenue numbers are unknown it's estimated that he was bringing in at least a few hundred th000 per month in less than 5 years after starting his channel Millet was already amassing a small fortune and buying the car of his  dreams all right what's going on guys millich here with another video but today I thought I would switch it up and just do a real life video cuz been seeing plenty of new car videos on YouTube for the longest time and people people seem to like those videos they seem to get a lot of views so I thought I might as well do one yeah this car is pretty damn insane it's got a twin turbo V8 so once the turbo kick in you just have so much power it's ridiculous and if you're wondering how I was able to afford this car well the time I bought  it my sources of income were just uh skin. tray to own that site and then sponsored CSO gambling videos and some other sponsorships to like game flip but it was mainly skin. trade cuz that's I used to make a ton and then I did make a pretty good amount from gambling sponsorships one decision in 2015 changed the trajectory of M Skillet's life however in 2018 that path would once again be altered by a single decision from csgo's developers valve on the 29th of March 2018 valve made an update to csgo that almost totally  crippled the skin economy starting today CSCO items received in trade will have the same 7-Day trade cool down as items purchased in game or via the steamed Community Market this drastically slowed down the rated people traded skill SK and cost numerous csgo sites millions of dollars vve attempted to regulate the csgo skin Market in the past having sent out ceas and assist letters to several larger CSO gambling sites the update was followed by a massive bandwave of butt accounts that were primarily used as a  tool for trading on gambling sites Millet was also hit hard by V's new policy as his new csgo magic site was shut down just a month later and his $100,000 inventory was banned due to being linked with bots in only a matter of months M skillet lost his primary source of income and the inventory he spent the last 5 years building such unfortunate circumstances would severely fracture anyone's emotional state but MC Skillet tried to play it cool and reinvent his YouTube to fit the new changes I'm trying bro I was going to  revamp things in April and still will for the most part since I already recorded stuff except in the future insane budget case opening videos will be hard it's real hard to still come up with csgo skin video ideas after making 500 plus videos on them sadly millet wouldn't be able to make good on this promise as his last upload was in February of 2018 on his Twitter profile Millet changed his bio to retired and became inactive on social media in general many speculated that since Millet had already built up a fortune  from his previous business he' lost interest in CSG go and saw no need to continue in a striving Market that was becoming increasingly hostile this seemed like the most logical conclusion given the limited information on Millet but this was far from the truth as M Skillet's life was slowly falling apart behind the scenes on the 18th of August 2018 MC Skillet would inform his parents about his ongoing mental breakdown he admitted to his mother that he had driven his McLaren 150 mph in a 25 mph Zone all whilst going in the wrong  direction his father asked him what he thought would happen if the police caught him where Millet said neither the police or their bullets could hurt me Millet and his parents wrongfully assumed just how dangerous this type of behavior really was and thought that it would only in confrontation with police but the stakes were much higher than that on the 23rd of August 2018 the lives of everyone in M Skillet's family would change forever the day would start off with when a family friend who was also a practicing psychiatrist made a  call to 911 with regards to Millet situation hi my name is Dr Mary Lester and I'm a psychiat and I'm calling to report an emery I delete IND who is a danger to himself in a danger to other um he threatened his mother in a early hour because he thought that he cut the THB that and that he would harm her and she beared for Good Wife and left the house with him scaming at her he never been violent I do believe that he's suffing from a illness and that he should be on a d white his name is Trevor heightman he weigh about 180 L he  18 year old family has been tried to convince Garten hospital volly and he not um willing to at the point he I believe they're actually friends mine and I just happen to be a psychiatrist and as they are describing his behavior very clear that EIC and the he ptic he never been dangered completely doubt never been in trouble very very much the pain and he has uh it appears for about five days he has been acting um in a b start just FL way the family does not believe that he using any sort of drug he said no drug shortly after  three saner police officers arrived at the residence and met with his parents to discuss the situation it's an infraction and I it's not going to work he has to be doing something violent he has to be wanting to harm himself harm someone else I understand what you're saying about the 5150 criteria and I'm sure you know it well but we have we have laws that we have to do I'm not willing to go in I won't go to prison to get him into a hospital when it's illegal for me to do so I I know I I know that but what I'm  trying to say is I hear what you're saying and I'm not discrediting that but we have to have something substantial because we're getting here say he's driving down fast down the wrong side of the road yeah it's wrong but it's an infraction it's it's not and we didn't witness you know it's it's got to be something it's got to be some a serious credible threat I was explaining the gentleman his mother saying that he has many behavior and his neighbor who was a psychiatrist suggesting to hold him under a section 5150 hold sadly the  officers didn't take the request to detain MC Skillet a decision that would soon prove fatal by 4:15 p.m. M Skillet woke up and was fixated on leaving the house house and took his McLaren with him ramming into his father's car in the process he was then spotted at Ashley Fall's Elementary School at 423 p.m. as he rammed his McLaren through the fence and drove into the school parking lot staff at the school would go over and talk to him where they said M Skillet mumbled and slowed some words resulting  in the school staff stating that something is wrong with him did he like just break through the fence he just took off right here you know you're driving in a school zone right hey what's wrong what you do here [Music] hey what did he just say did he say that talk to you something's wrong with him he's coming back he's coming back hi hi what happening you have a crazy ass on your campus right now driving in a sports car chasing after the kids what do you mean I mean there is a crazy ass call 911 right  [Music] [Music] now 7 minutes later at around 4:30 p.m. Millet would enter the southbound I5 freeway where he caused a hid and- run incident MC Skillets was on a path of destruction fued by ertic behavior and it seemed like no one could stop him a minute later at 4:31 p.m. his father would call 911 and relay the events that transpired in the morning stating that his son was in a manic State and just ran into two cars in the property leaving at a high speed six short minutes later his concerns would become  a reality when at 4:35 p.m. a wrongway driver reportedly speeding on the 805 has just crashed near La Hoya Village Drive now let's get to 10 news anchor Brian schlonsky he is in the 10 News live center with the details on this Brian well stepen in uh Lindsay this is obviously a major injury crash here along the 805 early reports from CHP uh that this was a wrongway driver involved here uh the cars you can see just in pieces here and traffic everywhere a nightmare there on the 805 a Sig Alert has been issued already we have reports  that possibly one car was going at least 100 mph before the crash two cars were on fire when fire crws first rolled up to this we know that it's a major trauma injury here all Lanes there blocked Northbound uh it looked like officers further back before you hit la la Hoya Village Drive were diverting drivers even turning people around to try to get them off the freeway as you see now it looks like a second or third ambulance has pulled up here as well the images from Sky 10 man the wreckage just the  Collision killed Millet instantly and the force of impact was so great that his seat belts completely ripped his body apart but to make matters even worse the vehicle M Skillet collided with had two passengers inside two innocent people who had fell victim to Mill's Reckless actions a 43-year-old mother named Eileen and a 12-year-old daughter named Ariana at the time of their passing Eileen was training to become a licensed therapist and was also the mother to two sons and her 12-year-old daughter Ariana was days  away from starting the seventh grade following the tragedy rumors of M Skillet's involvement in the crash began circulating online as fans noticed the McLaren in the news reports what up guys pretty sad video today I just woke up and I received the news that M Skillet has potentially died in a car crash I haven't got 100% confirmation of this but um I woke up and a guy on Snapchat was linking me a lot of evidence I've also visited the csgo Reddit and it appears to be the top of that as well so I might end up taking this video down it  might not 100% be true there are a lot of factors at the moment all pointing to the fact that it is probably true I believe this right here is meant to be the wreckage of MC Skillets McLaren as I said none of this has been 100% confirmed yet um but I checked on Steam when he was last online it was about 7 hours 40 minutes ago which apparently was about 45 minutes before the crash so this is incredibly fresh none of it is confirmed yet the description of the video was soon changed to confirm mix  Skillet's passing you'd expect such an event to elicit sympathy for all parties involved but that simply wasn't the case this time people saw m Skillet's final actions as him throwing a tangum over the recent decline in his business hate comments flooded his channel as people labeled him as a self murder who should have taken his own life without taking others down with him with keemstar tweeting imagine driving down the highway and some suicidal 18-year-old YouTuber with a super car kills you and  a family member I'm actually so angry right now innocent people died for no reason at all regardless it had already happened and there was nothing anyone could do about it while some loudly expressed their hatred for millet others showed a more sympathetic side to him namely the son of the woman he just killed in his hard to blame Heyman for the crash even though it was Heyman driving the wrong way he was not in his right frame of mind and that was the the primary reason that he found himself going the wrong way on a highway and  that my my prayers and thoughts are also for his his family as well an autopsy performed on M Skillet showed that there were no drugs in his system and further police investigation showed he didn't try to Swerve or avoid the crash was all this a product of a mental decline that was properly tried or was it just a rich teenager being reckless in his sports car after an unfavorable game update I'll let you decide on that one by the 2nd of August 2019 San Diego Union tribute reported that the family of the  victims had filed a lawsuit against Millet city and county the lawsuit claims at San Diego Police were negligent by not taking in heightman 18 for a mental health evaluation recommended by a psychiatrist which would have kept him off the road and prevented the deaths of Eileen 43 and 12-year-old Ariana they seek unspecified damages for emotional distress funeral and medical costs and loss of support and companionship as of this recording the case is still Ono M Skillet's name wasn't entirely tarnished as on the 3rd  of December 2020 vve would add some references to him in their broken Fang update for csgo vve added M Skillet's logo across the new Counter-Strike map andage at the end of the day day you could see M Skillet as a reckless kid that went on a joy ride after losing everything or as a mentally unwell adolescent going through a tough part of his life M Skillet started out as a lucky teenager who was able to build and profit from the csar skin economy as it went viral a combination of unforeseen circumstances put him in the right place  at the right time to receive an unfathomable amount of success but it was also due to that random chance that his success was stripped away from him ultimately triggering the manic episode that ended in tragedy for both his family and that of his victims without a doubt M Skillet's story is filled with unexpected twists of Fate for better and for worse this leaves many wondering how differently things would have turned out for Trevor if he was given one more favorable outcome 
Y178	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTminiwOZYY	hi my name is Lacey Solis owner and creator of the brand oil of pearls I am a licensed esthetician and had been for the last 15 years in the industry I've mostly worked directly for Brands and over the past couple of years I brought my brand Vision to life at oil of pearls the focus is definitely rooted in fullness it's all about my clients overall skin health and the longevity of its future today I'm going to introduce you to bio repeal it's a brand that I have fallen in love with and I have a passion for I  only align and look for brands that really fit my ethics and this is one of them I hope you truly enjoy and can't wait to show you what the journey is this line is truly one of a kind you can find it on bio skin aesthetics.com it is a frontier of new aesthetic feeling the company has began its journey in the U.S and as you can see bioskin Aesthetics is the only authorized North American distributor for the products the line was first created in Italy and has been around since 2017. recently introduced to us in 2020 and  you can reach out for more information first you'll want to take a look at the setup it only requires a couple of items such as removal items some gloves and of course alcohol wipes for prepping you'll want to make sure you do a thorough consultation with your clients as always and follow contraindications that you would be trained on and listed here we're just going to do a basic wrap for our client we want to make sure that we have her prepped and draped for our first steps glove up as always  we're going to do a double cleanse and of course we take our time to do proper removal and make sure no residuals are remaining in the next steps you'll see me transition into pre-prep for the peel which includes alcohol wipe and I'm going over these areas multiple times of course asking the client to take a moment to hold a breath if necessary so that I can get a three swipe on her skin I prefer to make sure that it's really balanced within the oils and so we want to take our time and not rush this  process [Music] the end of this you'll see me going right around the areas that might be least hit of course we can take this peel all the way underneath the under eye area and over the brows so as we begin we're going to do a blend of this prior to starting to apply so we of course need to shake the vial three times and then extract in this portion the goal is to get the peel all over the skin so that we can start the clog it sits for about five to seven minutes once it has been properly applied all over you're going  to use about a 1.5 ml to a two so as you're placing the products we're going to go ahead and just start to massage them into key areas of the skin the idea's placements in the forehead the cheek under the chin around the nose and mouth area as you'll see in a moment we're going to start to massage this in even more once it's all placed this is what I was talking about when I said it needs to make sure it was properly emulsified into the green formula so here I'm finishing off getting our placements set on the skin  foreign at this time we're going to transition once it's all extracted onto the skin to a massaging application of course this is a 35 TCA so the goal is to be very precise and specific with where we are placing we want to watch areas of course you can take it up underneath the under eye but we want to watch the inner and outer corner of the eye area the mouth avoid any specific areas that could cause concern so now we will massage into place until we form where we get a tack on the skin the goal  is to apply then we're going to start to time but we need to First apply make sure it's emulsified all the way into the skin [Music] right again around key areas such as the Chang jawline [Music] yeah and now we will start to at some point right here check on the amount of tackiness that we're feeling on the skin during this whole process I will check in with my clients asking how is she feeling is everything going okay you can see I did use a little fan for her on the in-between time foreign I like a few transitions of our removal  you'll want to try first to go over it with a cool towel than aesthetic Wipes we also like to sponge over the skin to make sure that there's no residuals [Music] we end again on a 4x4 to make sure that we're not seeing any remaining residuals which will be a little tinge of green if you do have anything left on the skin we finished this process with the rehydra formulas for serum and the moisturizer we do finish the plants off with an SPF to make sure that the skin is properly hydrated and protected before she's  going back out into the day now the beautiful part about this this is immediately after this peel also happens to be a seasonless peel because there is no photosensitivity you can do this year round the products are stable which makes them highly competitive in the market it's a patented formula you can see here this is immediately after and here's a little snapshot this was her second session so that was her very first before and here's the after thanks for watching stay tuned for more [Music]

 somebody who kind of Retreats into themsel in a way that they could be someone who is potentially a little bit closed off with regards to their feelings their emotions um they you could even pick up on this person maybe even having some fears of commitment so this is all in the way that you think that they feel almost like there's a there's a strong connection here very spiritual some of you it may even be that you think that they feel that there is something significant here past life energy old
 
 soul and it kind of makes me feel like you it's kind of like you know that they know like you're looking at them and you're just like how can you deny this how are you not seeing this um is kind of the energy that I'm getting from this how are you not seeing this um I feel like there's you think that they feel definitely a very strong emotional connection to you um that you think that they they they feel about you that this connection is something that they've never had before that it is something that is
 
 quite unique um kind of like you think that they feel like this is like a higher level maybe soulmate or Divine even a Divine counterpart situation um you know this card here it is what it is talks about radical acceptance you know and accepting things or you know people situations for what it is there's also a number six there the six is the lovers in the tarot and so yeah especially with the high priestess being here that you think that they feel that like I said that there is a very strong Soul connection here
 
 whether it be soulmate or Divine counterpart twinflame type of energy for some of you um some of you might even think that this person feels like this connection is unlike anything they've ever experienced before I do have a feel that you think that they feel that it is of something very spiritual something that maybe goes beyond ex explanation you know something something quite different something quite unique very spiritual very high level uh type of energy here um yeah and I feel like you might even
 
 be someone with the high priestess energy here who is someone who has a lot of prophetic dreams or visions you might think that they feel that they're experiencing potentially um like 5D type of energy because it could be something that you're experiencing you know so it almost gives me this this feeling like like how are they not AC accepting this how are how are they not seeing this like there there's something here that is quite significant um like I said whether or not they are in uh denial about it or they try to
 
 shut down and close thems off or you know having difficulty maybe with accepting it or with even you might even think that they feel like are they ready for this are they ready for this level of cuz it makes me feel like this connection is not ordinary like just an ordinary type of connection there's something very high vibrational something very transformative something very healing about what you think that they feel in this that it's something quite different um I have a feeling that you think that they feel that this
 
 connection is something that could be restoring Faith and Hope that true love and relationships that feed your soul in a sense are actually possible and that a lot of healing and transformative energy can take place okay I feel like you think that they feel that this very well might be a connection not only that they haven't experience before but that you have shown them something so different in that it is possible to connect with [Music] people on such a deep soul level okay is kind of what I'm getting
 
 here okay so let's get a little bit more to see what I think I'm going to save the connecting energy let's look at how uh your person actually feels towards you okay so we have card wow number 11 um we have in Perfect Harmony okay in perfect harmony let's make sure that we have room here in Perfect Harmony let's put this one we have the lizard which is fire energy could potentially be Aries Leo Sagittarius um number 11 is the Justice card okay in the tarot we also have the sun beautiful the sun I hope this fits
 
 later and then we also have growth and it says I want to wow I want to expand my Consciousness and my awareness okay so this makes me feel that the way that your person actually feels is that what okay first I want to say this what you're picking up on from this person I feel like is accurate because this person over here what they actually feel here is that it is something that is very balanced I almost feel like with the number 11 here in Justice like they feel like experiencing this type of connection with you is like long overdue
 
 I feel like because this person may have been someone who has gone through a lot of challenging relationships and it's kind of like when they experience this type of energy with you that it's kind kind of this the sun energy is about life force Vitality joy happiness and here or seeing these two people who are just like in a state of bliss um and the way that they're kind of you know supporting each other one right here in the middle by holding hands but the way that they've kind of arched their bodies back almost like
 
 they're supportive of of each other's weight in a sense so there is this balance here um the sun is also masculine energy The High Priestess is feminine so like I said this could be like Divine counterpart okay soulmate maybe like I said for some of you twin flame um but yes I I feel like this connection how they actually feel is that the two of you um balance each other out okay I feel like your connection is something that kind of uplifts uplifts their spirit and maybe there has been maybe you have done
 
 something that has really I feel like sparked something within this person that is really helping them to grow and change and transform I feel like even with the lizard being here it is a very very regenerative you know if a lizard loses its tail it grows it back it grows it back again so this makes me feel like you know if this person had lost something in their past it's almost like you've you've your your connection with them has brought about this regenerative Force to it you know here out of this I
 
 don't even know what kind of instrument this is I don't think I don't know I don't know if I should guess or not if it's a trumpet or something else Maybe I'm Wrong a horn I don't know but there's a bunch of music that is coming out here and there's rose petals and stars and something super beautiful so I want to expand my Consciousness and my awareness so I have a feeling that this person actually feels towards you that there is something very maybe very spiritual about you you could be very spiritual here okay very
 
 much into spirituality and nurturing your um intuitive gifts very intuitive person but I feel like this person with the I want to expand my Consciousness and my awareness that maybe because of the way that you embody your energy here in the high priestess that this person kind of wants to grow and evolve I feel like your energy is something that's very inspiring to them and I feel like it's kind of wanting to uh transform you know they feel that there is this very I feel like balanced energy between the two of you
 
 um I feel like this person feels very drawn to you very attracted to you they just kind of I don't know it almost kind of makes me feel like this person feels it like on such a deep level that goes beyond just say like physical attraction it's something deeper that this person feels I kind of have a feeling that this person kind of holds you in high regard and like I said for some of you it's whether or not they're actually coming forward and actually saying that to you I feel like the way the what you do to
 
 this person energetically is something that makes them want to I feel like ascend spiritually that wants to grow uh transform become a better version of themsel [Music] um some of you this person could listen to a lot of music you know uh they could even if there's somebody who's very creative they can even be someone who kind of writes songs or lyrics or you know uh listens to music that that with you in mind right things that remind them of you the sun energy is also very abundant so it makes me feel like this person
 
 feels that you in their life okay regardless of what the circumstances are right now cuz I I know some of you could actually be dating the person some of you could be separated from the person or even broken up um but it makes me feel like this person feels like being around you being around your energy having you know knowing you you being in their life or you know maybe past tense were in their life that there is this blessing here grateful I feel like having gratitude um for the experience so yeah it makes me definitely feel like
 
 this person there's something about your energy that that makes them want to grow makes them want to change makes them want to let go of certain limitations you know and and kind of grow outside of them um yeah this I mean even the the lizard energy is is is quite spiritual there is also this energy of telepathy here which is interesting because you have this telepathic energy here with the high priestess so it could even be that you know you guys just have like your own language with kind of like unspoken
 
 like there is kind of like this inner knowing between the two of you even if you know like I said that door is closed here even if it's something that they're not saying to you it's kind of like you know that they know and they know they know they feel it they you know it's here so it makes me almost kind of feel like this person feels this sense of uh some kind of relief I'm going to move this over a bit you guys cuz I know that later when I crop this video down to the size that it needs to be for YouTube
 
 that it might kind of crop it too short and it might make it so that you guys can't see the card so hopefully that is okay let's see okay yeah it's a very spiritual uh energy here so let's look at what the connecting energy is um between the two of you but I almost kind of feel like looking at this already I mean we have the high priestess here so I feel like those of you that chose this pile your intuition is on point your intuition is on point with this connection um so yeah let's look at that we have number 33 angels and
 
 Masters wow and this is the energy con this is the connecting energies look at the chakras all just lit up here activated there's angel wings around here too which makes me feel that this this connection that you have with this person is something that is divinely guided it is a faded connection regardless of regardless of like I said what the current circumstances are whether you are with the person not with the person I I definitely feel like there is something significant about why you and this
 
 [Music] person connected with each other um to me this is is kind of like this energy of Enlightenment [Music] or like Divine energy here something very very spiritual here I I have a feeling it's very 5D okay the connecting energy between the two of you not only you know what you're experiencing here but there's also this very spiritual very ethereal energy about this as well some of you this could even be like a connection that you you had maybe that has awakened the two of you okay a spiritually Spiritual
 
 Awakening this kind of makes me feel like some type of Kundalini Awakening um okay let's see let's hopefully this fits here okay we have the Healer well yeah definitely a very very spiritual connection the Healer energy here is between the two of you so connecting energy being that we have all of these chakras that are lit up here they're all it looks like they're all being activated you know you know and of course that is something that takes time because even when you go through a spiritual awakening a
 
 Kundalini Awakening um it is something that starts in the root chakra okay and the Kundalini is something that rises like a like a snake it rises through um each of the chakras and if all of that happened at once okay which it rarely does okay because there are blockages here to work through Kundalini starts to rise Within These and if there is blocked energy here these energy centers in the body think of them as like this wheel of flowing energy right they're they're flowing here and that's when that that
 
 you know the the chakra is in I want to say working order doing what it's supposed to be doing but when we start to have go through things and you know have like feelings and emotions and anger and all kinds of stuff that we experience guilt shame anger it starts to get trapped in here and it kind of dims the light in a way so that instead of that being a powerful kind of energy center within the body it starts to slow down it starts to become kind of not as say like active right so when you go
 
 through a spiritual awakening that Kundalini starts to rise first within the root chakra and starts to move through here so with the Healer being here it makes me feel that this is a very healing transformative connection between the two of you and that I feel like you were meant to awaken you are meant to work on your spiritual path you're meant to you know move through and remove the blockages within the chakras you know and reaching you know like I said a a major Kundalini Awakening with which is activating all
 
 of the chakras that would be something that would probably shock your system too much and so it kind of Rises very slowly when you're ready because this that would probably I don't want to say would put you in the hospital but you know it would be quite quite um I think they call that um I can't remember what they call it some type of some type of uh crisis or something like that it's it can be very very overwhelming okay um too much to handle because of course with the crown chakra being activated as
 
 well the crown cannot activate unless it's it's it's able to move through these chakras right we have to clear blockages here um the crown chakra is our connection to Source um you know essentially High 5D okay 5D energies um and it takes work right to to kind of clear these blockages here most people only function from the lower chakras okay most we experience things down here and when we can really heal we can open up to experience higher frequency higher vibrational um energies here where we're no longer limited by
 
 things here but that's another topic before I get too too much off of in a tangent but basically this is you know this is a very healing energy that's between the two of you I do feel that this is a very very spiritual connection um it could be that you and this person you know have really kind of healed and have maybe even triggered certain things within each other uh for healing here an incredible amount of of of of transformation um that is here it's it's such a beautiful energy pile one I don't know that other P the other
 
 piles are going to be like this but this is definitely very very spiritual ual you know look it on both sides here and even this connecting energy between the two of you definitely feel like it is something that is divinely guided you know and like I said maybe you know if regardless of what the circumstances are right now there's definitely a very clear purpose here okay a very clear purpose for you to activate maybe each other and activate healing um some of you this could be healing generational
 
 trauma we have three snakes here so it makes me feel like maybe there's three generations here you know that you could be healing and I feel like both feminine and masculine energies here this balance here the masculine here on this side the feminine energy here on this side um okay so now let's let's start pulling some tarot here and we're going to pull a little bit more okay with what how you think that they feel towards you let's pull and see okay so how do you think that they feel towards you how do you think they feel towards
 
 you the Three of Wands okay we have the eight of Pentacles The Three of Wands let's see how am I going to put these in here let's move them up here and then we also have Temperance Sagittarius energy and let's pull one more how do you think they feel the Knight of Swords so I think that you feel hold on I think that you think they feel that you are someone who is healing patient with them as they're moving through this healing energy um the eight of Pentacles is also a card of of self-mastery it's about putting in
 
 a lot of hard work and effort into something here so I do think that you feel that this person is someone who is wanting to that they miss you okay for some of you if you are at a distance from this person that you think that they feel like they're thinking about you they miss you they're wanting to come towards you and you know communicate um that you think that they feel about more or less I feel like about investing more time and energy here that they want to work on things that they want to work
 
 on themselves they want to feel more you know balanced and healed here the Three of Wands can also talk about future foresight thinking ahead planning ahead so it could even be that you think that this person feels I'm I'm getting like this energy of like thinking about the future you know planning a future so some of you might even think that you know this person is planning it could be planning you know what their steps are about what they're going to say um that they see a future with you okay h
 
 H okay now let's look at what they actually feel we're going to pull some tarot over here some of you can also be dealing with an aries um we've got air sign energy Gemini uh Libra and Aquarius okay also Virgo energy okay so how do they actually feel towards you how do they actually feel towards you how do they actually feel towards you Knight of Wands okay look at how that wolf is like howling very attracted to you to me this is also this energy of pursuing like they're feeling maybe like the call of their
 
 soul with that Knight of Wands like that let's see how do they actually feel towards you this is such a beautiful energy we have the devil how do they actually feel the devil the devil could be fear the devil can also talk about hidden desire desire for something Capricorn energy we've also got the page of Wands how do they actually feel towards you the hant wow wow and the nine of Swords okay so if you're not in a committed relationship with this person this person does think about long-term commitment with you
 
 okay um but I feel like with the nine of Swords energy here there is anxiety here there is fears um if you're already committed or married to this person you know then it could be a little bit of these fears about you know wanting to to I feel like make sure that your connection is something that does last look who's at the bottom the empress so this person you know for for some of you this is this person loves you okay they see you as their Empress as their kind of like the love of their life I feel
 
 like um I feel like this person like there's something also that you bring out in this person's energy that is very youthful cuz I'm noticing that we have the page and the Knight here these are very youthful energies very passionate so it could be that you bring something out in this person some of you it could be that you touch kind of like in a way like their inner child okay there's a healing nurture ing energy about you that this person feels it's like I said it's it's kind of like it's deeply
 
 transformative like this makes me feel like there's healing inner child here fears that maybe their inner child has that you're even you're getting that deep in with this energy that's been H that's happening here this this activation that's here um we've got Taurus and Libra energy here also Sagittarius um Gemini I want to see what's at the bottom of the other deck the King of Swords how you think this person feels with the King of Swords looking at this King of Swords here he's sitting here with his eyes
 
 covered the King of Swords is a little bit more of a detached energy so I kind of feel like kind of like how we saw that door on this side over here that door closed even though it's like illuminated so it makes me feel like you think this person feels a little detached they're guarded they're protected but there's feelings here look at that the queen of cups is under here they're they you know they might be somebody who is not so good with their feelings talking about them expressing them feelings and emotions but it's like
 
 you think that they they they feel the feelings there but they're hiding them and covering or concealing them with this King of Swords type of like I don't have feelings I don't have feelings but look at how this person feels it's like wait I'm and the Two of Pentacles and I feel like you know the Two of Pentacles is also about choices going up I mean the Two of Pentacles can also be about um going kind of back and forth you know so especially if you are someone who is not committed to this person not in a
 
 relationship with them um there is for some of you there is a fear of commitment here okay a fear of of of committed relationship even though I feel like that they actually feel so drawn to you you know the page of Wands is also this very energy of excitement of Adventure of passion you know there may also be this non-committal energy here where especially for those of you where this person does have a fear of commitment okay some of you it could be that this person is someone who had been and of course this
 
 isn't going to be for all of you okay so don't take the message if I'm not for you but I'm also getting a person who has been maybe a little bit of a player in their life who's been spent a lot of time being single or kind of just going from connection to connection to connection relationship relationship and it's kind of like something about your energy is different so this makes me feel like if they were once kind of like a player and a person who was has always been kind of like non-committal that
 
 this connection is something that could actually be changing and transforming this person Beyond being that way you know kind of like a reformed player reformed player um yeah I definitely feel like there's something very instinctual and very very much something I definitely feel this person is feeling a very intense energy with you very attracted you know the empress is a beautiful energy um it is about fertility and you know some of you this person could even think about having a family with you
 
 wanting a family with you planning um I feel like they feel insanely attracted to you okay so where are we at we're already 40 minutes into your reading guess these piles are going to be pretty long today okay so what else do we want to do um let's get some messages okay cuz I don't want it's already I don't want it to be super long let's get some messages um from your person what do they want to say to you what does your person want to say to you we have time okay so it says please give me more time to prove that I can be
 
 a better person for you we also have damaged and it says you deserve much more than what I could give you my heart was damaged unlocked so they this person I feel like has a lot of healing to do okay okay um like I said earlier I'm getting kind of mother wounds or feminine energy masculine it could be mother wounds father wounds there's a lot of generational um I feel like trauma healing um here we also have only you you are the only one that makes my heartbeat fast you are the one for me wow I don't know how the other piles are
 
 going to do again this one here we have waking up and it says I didn't believe in true love until I met you you helped me to wake up look at [Music] that wow we also have future it says we are not over I still dream about a future with you let's get one more regret it says I regret my mistakes and I hope the universe will give us another opportunity so this may be especially for those of you that are uh separated or broken up or you know maybe having some issues here and then at the bottom of the deck
 
 we have contact and it says I want to contact you and be honest but I'm not sure if you want to hear from me okay and we have soulmate we have known each other in another life I can feel this connection in my soul and that's exactly what is coming through here a attracted I'm so attracted to you I have never felt this way before clearly we can see that okay all right so I'm going to leave it here for you pile number one I do hope this is helpful for you guys and I will see you in the next reading hi pile two so those of you that
 
 resonated with the blue rose quartz this is going to be your reading today so we are finding out how you think your person feels towards you versus how they actually feel okay so you want to make sure that you resonate with this first part of the reading where we're asking how you think they feel if that matches what you actually think um then you've chosen the right pile if not go back and choose one of the other um piles so I did pull the oracle cards um before this reading just to save time cuz a lot um so this
 
 here is going to be part of what you actually think that they or what how you think they feel okay um which is these here this is going to be the connecting energy between the two of you and then this over here is going to be how they actually feel towards you so we'll look at this first to make sure that this resonates for you what it is what you're actually feeling here um if it does you can keep watching if not you want to go back and choose something else okay so how do you think they feel towards you we have card number
 
 16 and it says say the Royal you okay we have judgment here we have the gelle which is element of fire so Aries Leo Sagittarius potentially for some of you um also getting Scorpio energy here and then we have purpose and it says I know what I am here to do okay so how do you think they feel towards you okay so first off I think that you feel that this person is very attracted to you um but I also feel like pile two that you get into your head a little bit and you might at sometimes and I feel like
 
 it's because of this gazelle energy the gazelle energy is a little bit hypervigilant maybe goes into worrying or anxiety and we do have judgment here so it could be that you kind of you know get into your head a little bit and you might over think how this person feels towards you like it's kind of like you know that they that they um feel that you're very attractive um but I feel like you might at the same time too because you might overthink you might also feel like this person is judging you or criticizing you
 
 or you could also be someone who kind of asks a lot of questions maybe CU you're uncertain in some regard here um yeah so you might kind of feel and I and like I said I kind of feel like it might be just because of this gazelle energy here the hyper vigilance overthinking overanalyzing like your mind kind of racing here um you might also kind of think that way too about them that maybe there's someone who's in their head a lot um h for some of you I think that you feel that this person feels some type of um
 
 past life connection with you um that you feel that they think they feel that they're some type of Purpose with this connection um maybe that could even be about clearing Karma here or even some type of karmic cycle that you and this person have gone through um for some of you I think that you think that this person feels that there is some type of it also feel cuz number 16 here is the tower energy and the tower energy can bring in a peil chaos um Awakening a revelation okay maybe to some kind of purpose here
 
 so you might even think that this person feels like this connection is meant to to help bring maybe some type of awareness in some regard um it could be something that this person is still trying to figure out okay how this how this connection kind of plays a role I feel like in their life um I feel like you you feel maybe at times this person goes between having faith and trust in the connection and then other times kind of goes back into a place where they may not be so trusting and I feel like that's more or
 
 less judgments off of past situations that this person has gone through okay what else am I getting here I also feel like you think this person feels that you okay what I'm what I'm kind of getting with this energy is that you think this person feels and and I feel like you could be someone pile number two who is very attractive and that this person how do I explain this energy that this person might be someone who kind of perceives you in a way that you're just like not that this is a you know
 
 I'm not I don't want you to take this in a bad way because the gazelle also has a very vulnerable energy very vulnerable so it makes me feel like if you know you you truly are somebody who is very attractive that they also see you as somebody who is a little vulnerable and that may also be because of past situations that you've gone through as well some painful things that you've gone through hm what else am I seeing here I feel like you also think that this person feels afraid to trust okay which is something
 
 that was coming through here afraid to trust that things are not going to be in this connection maybe what they've been in the past for this person experiencing like whatever they've experienced in their past and it makes me feel like it has been quite challenging for them that you think that they feel afraid to really maybe even be vulnerable you feel like this person's afraid of being vulnerable with you afraid of of really opening up to this connection that you are someone who's kind of in a way challenging certain
 
 beliefs that they have about releasing them about letting them go you know and that could be maybe that you've with the purpose energy here that you've been someone who has tried to help this person to change their mindset to change and transform and to grow and to evolve into a better version of themselves you know the Judgment card is about our Soul's Calling it's about a wakeup call it's about transformation you know the Judgment card is is symbolic of the Phoenix Rising From the Ashes the death and
 
 rebirth um to bring about renewal and release from the past okay so I want to look at I think I'm going to save the connecting energy here for after we look at what your person actually feels towards you and then we're also going to pull some tarot here um as well okay so we have card number 13 it says feeling the world feeling the world we have the camel again fire energy here we have perseverance and it says I know that I can do whatever I set my mind to and then we also have the three of Cups three of
 
 Cups some of you with the Judgment card here could very well be separated from this person okay it won't be all of you but some of you it could very well be that you're separated and judgment could really be that you might feel like this person wants to reconcile with you or wants to you know start over and just kind of like leave the past in the past and start over again um with what this person actually feels towards you the three of Cups energy is about Joy it's about happiness it's also about
 
 uh you know emotionally bonding with people connecting socializing um it is also an energy of friendship ship but it's also an energy of supportive people so this person might feel that you are someone who has been um very supportive of them okay um this person might also feel that you are someone who is also very independent someone who is very um resourceful that you're very sure and I feel like more confident okay of yourself especially with that Royal you energy you know you may have done a lot of I feel like a lot
 
 of inner work on yourself to really build up your your confidence your self-esteem and to I feel like really kind of give off you know a a a beautiful energy you know but I definitely feel like it's through a lot of transformation here that you have that energy um what else do I want to say this H I definitely feel like this person has feelings towards you with the camel energy though it kind of comes across as very like calm very calm energy very soothing so it could even be that your connection
 
 with them is something that makes them [Music] feel that it's okay it's safe to love it's safe to open up because with the feeling with the world card here to me feeling the world sounds like a person who's holding on to a lot of stuff like the weight of the world feeling the world um and that could be symbolic of this person holding on to because also the camel holds on to water which makes me feel like this person could even be somebody who's kind of holding back holding back from your you in some
 
 regard but with the perseverance here it says I know that I can do whatever I set my mind to which is about moving past challenges obstacles continuing to move forward so yeah I do feel like this person does is someone who enjoys spending time with you being around you talking to you three of cups is also an energy of um friendship here you know this person might feel like you're someone who kind of balances them out in some way that you bring balance here within this connection here some of you may even be um yeah cuz
 
 look at that we've got fire and water fire and water they are two opposing forces two opposing forces of energy so some of you might even feel like this person is like because you're somebody who's super attractive and there's this fire energy here that you might think that they're attracted to you and I feel like this is again this is you getting into your head a little bit that you might feel like this person just wants you for intimacy they just want you you know for for just that non-committal but I feel like this
 
 person actually has feelings here they actually have feelings here and they could be kind of holding back with them especially with the feeling the world it could be you know just more or less this energy of of holding back they could also be somebody who's going through some transformation here as well we've got cancer Scorpio and Pisces energy here as well okay so let's look at what the connecting energy is between the two of you we have the kiss okay the kiss um and we also have number 24 with
 
 listening listening I feel like with this connecting energy here between the two of you that both of you kind of feel a very intense connection with each other here we're seeing two people that are kind of holding hands here and I feel like both of you may be really you know trying to tune in and listen to what your intuition um is telling you I feel like there's there's definitely a need here for really commun for communicating um um I feel like being far more open with with uh throat chakra with throat chakra
 
 energy here being able to really voice things I feel like this is also listening to your heart your feelings versus the the thinking you know what does your heart say to you what is your what are your feeling ings here and there definitely being this Bond and this connection between the two of you I feel like there is a lot of daydreaming about one another a lot of both of you kind of trying to understand your feelings understand your emotions trying to tune into the intuition with how to move I feel like this connection
 
 forward okay so I want to pull some tarot here and I want to kind of see again how you think they feel towards you and then we'll do the same over there with them how do you think they feel towards you we have the eight of Swords so yeah you definitely think that this person is feeling trapped or kind of taking on a more passive a more passive energy holding back limiting themsel and kind of for some of you like even keeping their distance you might even think that this person feels afraid about future about
 
 planning anything about I mean it for some of you it might even have to do with distance here like they have this longing for you to be with you to talk to you to connect with you but like they're holding back here they could be um having a lot of uh negative thoughts self-limiting beliefs how do you think they feel towards you Queen of Pentacles and wow look at that King and Queen of Pentacles so you think that they feel like they want a commitment a connection but there's fear here with that eight of swords swords like they're
 
 blocking thems like you feel it like they you think that they feel like there's a there's like this connection is meant to be that's what you think right you think that they they they are thinking this is meant to be but maybe they're in denial about it maybe they're Holdings back here okay and then it's bottom of the deck we do have the death card again Scorpio energy um Aries energies also here Taurus Virgo and uh Capricorn and we also have Gemini so let's now see how do they actually feel towards
 
 you how does your person actually feel towards you the lovers and judgment so yeah for some of you they definitely feel a bond here they definitely feel a connection some of you it could be something that they feel is past life okay past life connection um I feel like that they they they actually feel that your connection is something that is very intense it is something that has also I feel like been very transformative okay very transformative we have a beautiful butterfly here let's see what else again with the
 
 Scorpio energy Gemini I how do they actually feel towards you how do they actually feel towards you the magician and the eight of Pentacles okay so this person is I feel like very much wanting to there's interests here okay I feel like this person does think about commitment I feel like this person is wanting to put in and show you by putting in more effort here and I feel like that's also about working on themsel working on themsel here we've also got uh more Gemini energy here um Virgo as well and then under the bottom of this
 
 one we have the Queen of Swords I feel like this person is someone who yes they kind of might come across as a little guarded here almost like this person has these feelings that are here and feels that connection now if you guys are broken up separated and you know there could very well be that this person does think about reconciliation but I also feel like with the Queen of Swords energy here you know this is also a very Discerning energy I feel like this person wants to tell you the truth of how they do
 
 feel towards you which is the king of cups that there is feelings [Music] here what is under the death card the two of swords and [Music] Temperance yeah so this person definitely has feelings here this person Also may really care about you a lot I feel like this person has deeper feelings for you than they actually let on H definitely deeper feelings than they let on here I I feel like this person is someone who kind of also takes time to like imagine like fantasize in a way I feel like you guys
 
 both kind of find each other in a way like having dreams about one another okay I feel like you you also feel like this person is confused indecisive okay I want to look at this magician energy a little bit because the magician is about having the willpower to do something so maybe it's like this person is trying to work on maybe those aspects of themsel where they do have difficulty with really investing I feel like investing here why is the magician here the five of Pentacles the Six of Swords and the Seven of
 
 Pentacles so some of you there could be this detached energy here especially with that Queen of Swords that we saw I definitely feel like this person has some fears here some insecurities about feeling confident in their in their actions here and this you know of course with the five of Pentacles energy here this could have nothing to do with you this could be this own this person's own insecurities that they have to work on here H I want to look at your energy over here with this eight of Swords with how
 
 you think they feel what is this eight of Swords but I definitely feel like you think that they feel afraid of commitment here and that's kind of the vibe over here what is this eight of Swords temperance could even be a case where you're thinking that they feel like they need more time they need more time they may be wanting you to be patient you know with with healing and working past I feel like those uh limiting beliefs that are there there I kind of want to look at this listening here this connecting
 
 energy uh between the two of you so what is this listening about Spirit what is this listening about the four of cups what is this listening about the fool and Justice yeah so what I feel like the connecting energy here between the two of you um the four of cups is about missed opportunities it's about being distracted it's about not seeing the beauty of what is right in front of you right what is being offered here you know to me that listening is feeling like what is the intuition saying and I feel like with the fool
 
 energy here this is about taking a leap of faith doing the like it's almost like like your higher selves are telling you give this a chance go for it open yourself up to it take take the leap of faith get you know that that's what that's what I'm getting here like give it a chance what are you doing there could be something amazing here if only you would allow yourself to you know put any say like uh toxic or karmic patterns of behavior behind you you know maybe that does mean working on yourself so that that you can
 
 just allow yourself to kind of flow into receiving you know but this person might be somebody who is Right a little detached guarded and you know in order for us to really connect with somebody we have to let that guard down we have to be vulnerable okay so we are going to [Music] end and you're reading is a little shorter than pile one but I want you to know you know it doesn't mean that I love you any less Sometimes some energies come through a little different and a lot easier to just you know with the messages
 
 sometimes there's some readings that are a little complicated and they take more more effort or more time drawing in there so let's see what does your person want to say to you what messages your person have for you healing and it says we have to allow healing before having a real chance to be happy again we also have ego here and it says my pride and ego kept us apart I know now and I'm sorry what message does your person have for you what do they want to say to you right now immature it says I know that I
 
 was immature and I still need to grow and learn to be someone who deserves you we have romance I have romantic feelings for you I'm not sure if you feel the same please send me a sign maybe you've already given this person way too many signs I don't know let's see we have potential and it says I can already imagine our future life together and I love it so like I said I kind of feel like there's a lot of daydreaming that goes on here and we also have believe it says I believe that we can work things out I
 
 hope that you feel the same let's see what we have at the bottom we have shadows I'm working on my Shadows I have so much to change missing you I look at your pictures constantly you are so beautiful I miss you so much uh chance it says please give me a chance to prove that I'm worthy of your love and then we also have waking up I didn't believe in true love until I met you you help me to wake up all right okay so I'm going to leave this reading here for you pile number two I do hope this was helpful for you guys

you can go back to the beginning the time stamp for the zodiac signs if you wish to know and that's Linked In The Box below okay so we're going to start with your oracle cards Spirit what are their next actions towards you group one how do they feel what do they wish to do what is going on in these energies between you and this special person [Music] okay let's see what we have here so we have a power we have New Moon  promise we have surrender low self-esteem you deserve success love and abundance set an intention to identify and release any remnants of low self-esteem and we have ascending the mountain keep going forward okay so I feel like this person's energy towards you right now is very much an energy of [Music] feeling controlled by their own limiting beliefs okay I get I get the sense that this person definitely suffers from feeling unworthy you know feeling like they're not good enough um feeling that  you know over the years with the patterns that have developed for them through their other relationships through their experiences with love there's something in the patterns of their past where they were either taught through other other people's actions through being disappointed betrayed or let down they were taught that promises are not kept promises are broken people in this person's life have broken their promises to them okay and over time it has made this person feel very disempowered that is why I feel like  we're getting this very powerful energy of um needing to take back that power and so I feel that one of the great regrets that this person has about you is that maybe they haven't taken action right like they haven't taken enough action they haven't really showed you or expressed to you how much you mean to them how much they actually do want to be with you I feel like this person almost keeps like a an energy of Silence around them and I'm getting the energy that it's like they think that they are  communicating with you like they think that they are telling you what they want and how they feel but I feel like there's a disconnect between what they think that they are promising or what they think that they are expressing to you and how you are receiving that you are receiving that expression in a different way and I feel like that is the disconnect and I feel like that's what this person is starting to understand they're starting to see that in their mind they are telling you I have feelings for you they're not just  friendship they're romantic I have these intense feelings for you I have intense attraction to you I do want to be with you in their mind they think that they are expressing that they think that they are telling you that or showing you that in the best way that they can but for some reason I feel that you are not picking up on that like you you know it's not enough of an expression in your eyes right like you want more and that's fine right like it there's it's such an interesting thing because I feel like  coming from that sense of their own low self-esteem they they're only able to express themselves to a certain place they're not yet comfortable or they don't know how to yet fully openly say I love you okay they're afraid of that they're afraid of that because there's something within them that is afraid of being rejected that is afraid of actually saying it that's afraid of saying look I want to sit with you like this in front of the water I want us to truly be together I see us together I want to  make this promise but I don't know if if I make this promise if it will actually not turn into a heartbreak at some point because again I feel like people have broken their promises to this person this person has believed other people's promises in the past they've put their heart and soul into relationships in the past only to be disappointed backstab betrayed cheated on and that has really kind of brought them to some lows in their life that they don't want to go back to again so I feel like if they're not like the  most verbal expressive if they're not using their words in a more powerful way to show you how much they love you to show you or speak to you about how much they care it's almost like they see it as maintaining their own dignity they see it as I'm maintaining my own power here because I if I show too much if I say too much what if I I my heart gets trampled on again what if my heart gets broken again maybe the best way to maintain my power my dignity and to not get hurt is to just be a bit more  reserved you know not as open not and be a bit more silent because that might be a way to protect my heart but in terms of but what they're also realizing is that that's not going to work longterm okay they're going to have to start taking more concrete action towards you so now like for them it does feel like ascending a mountain it does feel like okay I do want this to go forward I do want us to move forward towards something better towards a deep connection towards a real relationship but to me it does feel like it is  ascending a mountain cuz i' I've I've gone up these mountains before only to fall off the cliff right so they're definitely taking their time they're definitely you know testing the waters wanting to see like is this can they trust can they trust that this is going to last if they make a promise promise to if they make a promise to you they want it to be real okay they don't want to make false promises to you they they don't want to make false promises in the way that others have made false promises to them okay that's  a big one when they make a promise and when they take that action towards you which I think they I I feel they will this is what they're preparing for is to make that offer of commitment to make that true promise to you they want it to be absolutely real they don't want to ever go back on that promise so if it takes them longer to make that promise they're okay with that so then what actions do they wish to take next we have the five of Pentacles we have the seven of Wands we have the hermit and we have the Six of Swords  okay interesting so again I feel like this is a confirmation right this is a confirmation of the energies that we've already seen okay and it's interesting because the six of Wands is also very much in alignment with that keep going forward okay so I feel like in terms of their next actions they're going to keep moving forward with you okay they want this relationship to move forward they want to build something real with you okay but this the these energies here are their fears kind of creeping in okay  so I feel like this reading for you group one is going to be about you know Spirit making you aware so that you're not surprised right Spirit making you aware and chillax about you know the process the mental and emotional process that this person is going through and to not take that personally okay it's not about you it's about their own resistance seven of Wands okay again that resistance comes from that low self-esteem it comes from the broken promises it comes from this hermit energy so before you met this person  they may have spent quite some time like alone you know they might have been single for a while because they were just kind of tired of the BS that they've had to deal dealt with deal with in the past so it's going to if they've been in this hermit mode for a while it's definitely going to take some some time to come out of that you know to trust again to open up their heart again um they also have felt very left out in the cold you know again they've been very disappointed these are just the same I feel like the confirmation of how  down down and out and dark this person has felt and why they have gone into that hermit mode while why they have kind of just with drawn from people and said you know what it's okay cuz I feel very attacked see like they felt very attacked very judged very put down by people they trusted in the past so this is why don't take this personally if they are slow if they're slowly moving forward that's fine that's okay let give them that space to take their time because they again I feel like they are taking their  time to come back into a better place emotionally so that when they make this promise it is real it's something that they can stand behind because it comes from them reclaiming their emotional spiritual and mental power and they need that they need that so I I love this actually you know I feel like this person is really working on this healing they're working on healing because they're inspired by those feel the feelings that they have for you they want to heal for you okay they want to heal themselves  they want to be in a good place so they can fully commit to you okay they want to be in a really good place for you and if they're not not in a really good place for you right now they're working towards that's the action they want to take they're working towards being in that good place okay they're working towards it and that's what's solid the commitment that they have to work towards making you that promise is what truly matters right in the long term yeah see so isn't it interesting how we're getting the timing this is  exactly what I was saying is that I feel like spirit is saying maybe have a bit of patience with this person okay they mean well they love you they do wish to be with you maybe have a little bit of patience on the timing around this see like I said they want this Union they want this eternal love with you but they want to do it right they want to heal they want to you know let go of some of these more you know challenging energies and tendencies that they have see they want fertility with you so if you're at  that point in life where you may want to start a family they're you know if you're at that stage they want that Union they want the family they want it all they want to create and plant those seeds for something real that's going to grow into something real with you and they are trying their best to come out of the old cycles and the old momentum and the old you know negative energies that they have experienced the old negative um you know patterns experiences cycles that have really left them very depleted you know  I do feel bad like I feel like this person has definitely been through some very challenging emotional times and so they're just trying to come out of it now you know they're just trying to come out of it and I feel like the closer they're getting to you the more it is inspiring them that hey you know it's time it's time for me to feel better it's time for me to embrace this love it's time for me to you know Believe In Love Again See No One Compares no matter how many people I've met and experiences I  have there's no one who compares to you there you go okay there you go my memories of you haunt me and keep me thinking about what could have been okay so take this as it resonates if you feel that you've had to step away from this person you know temporarily or you just felt like you know this person wasn't ready or they said they're not ready and they need some time you're still there okay they are still connected to you uh energetically in the heart in the mind that connection is still very real it's  still very present and it is coming it is coming okay there's a timing to this and the more you just let it be the more you detach your energies from this and just kind of let this person come to you it's going to work out okay so this is what I have for you if you'd like to have a personal reading with me you can do the live or the video recorded you can also order any the Oracle Decks that I have created and used in this reading everything is at Liv tarot.com also if you haven't already please make sure to subscribe  and like thank you so much for your support and I'll see you all on the next one all right my beautiful group two that chose this image and the gray adventurine and these zodiac signs right here which which I'm not going to state if you want to know what they are you can go ahead and click on the Tim stamp below for zodiac signs and let's start with your Oracle and then we will do your tarot what are their next actions towards group two this one was jumping out that what are their next actions towards  you okay let's see what we have here for you we have hunger we have passion wow okay there is a lot of fiery beautiful passionate energy that is coming through here I love it surrender to your intuition tune in to your inner voice be aware of any gut feelings FL lashes knowings or aha moments that come through to guide you wow and wondrous Universe walk in Beauty love this okay so I just feel like right now this person is incredibly taken with you okay they are incredibly attracted to you there's tremendous  amount of passion hunger there between the two of you I feel like this person may have a hard time when they feel something this deeply they may have a hard time actually expressing it because I think there's a part of them that is kind of very resistant to their own passion okay like they there's a part of them that ISC comfortable with these feelings okay I feel like your person may be somebody who tends to be more on the solitary side like tends to kind of like you know stick to themselves a little  bit more they might be a little bit more introverted um even if sometimes it seems like they're very friendly on the outside right like they may seem to be like you know somebody who you know you know can talk to people and stuff but you will notice that they they don't let anybody very close to their internal like who they are inside right like they can do casual talk they can be quite popular you know friendly all those things right but inside they might be very introverted like it takes them time  to open up they really value their space um they may you know be somebody who just needs to have their own uh alone time their own time with their own thoughts and their own emotions and they may be somebody who also is very um practical right like they like to hide behind rationality they like to hide behind oh I'm a logical person I'm a practical person I don't you know I don't like to take too many risks I don't like to put myself out there too much I feel like that is why right now with what whatever  this very deep and we're getting this very fiery energy right whatever is this deep passionate fiery energy that they feel for you I think it is making them very uncomfortable because they want to take action on it right they want to take action on it um but they are hesitating they're afraid because they're the the way that they feel around you it's like the effect that you have on them is something that is unusual for them okay so there's something here between the two of you that's very deep there's something here  that is very deep very passionate and I do feel that it goes beyond this life okay there's something here um especially if you guys haven't known each other for a long time I feel like you feel even closer than you think you would feel you know it's like oh but we haven't we only just met and yet we feel this very deep intuitive pull towards each other this eye is telling me that there's something here that that when you look at each other you see something very deep within each other again and it  could even be that you haven't known each other that long but there's something where it's like you can see through them and they can see through you and you see each other down to the core okay there's this there's this Vision okay there's this perception there's this you know like when you look at them you can see their soul and that is what is very scary to them the effect that you have on this person is much deeper than you think it is because they might be hiding it right like they might be trying to keep their passion for you  their hunger for you their deep attraction to you they might be trying to keep it a little bit secret right now right because again again it's something that makes them feel uncomfortable they are not used to having this kind of uh a response to someone okay they're not used to feeling this um and it's making them feel very very uncomfortable but not in a bad way right it's making them like ask themselves like what is this like why are you feeling this like you're not used to this you know um and so they are  also calling upon their own intuition to tell them okay I need to make sense of these emotions because I need to know what I'm should do next and I feel like what this person wants to do next is to act upon the passion is to act upon their feelings for you but I think that is something that is really scary to them they're just like oh my gosh like yes I want this um am I ready to act upon it because see there's something again about you see walk in Beauty I just feel like there's this unspoken intense connection and passion that this  person feels and they feel like it's just like part of the universe like it's coming from somewhere that is beyond just this moment in time okay there's something bigger at play here there's something much greater and bigger at play um that again is feeling so you know intense to this person that they almost don't know what to do Wow Wow Let's go deeper then what will they do Spirit what will they do 10 of Pentacles wow see there you have it there you have it it's so beautiful see so this this hunger that  they feel for you this passion that they feel for you is starting to give them images of like that happily ever after okay that oh my gosh this could be it you could be the one you guys could have everything you could build a life together like this could actually be something very serious very real Knight of Cups see this is the action they want to offer you their cup of Love they want to move forward Queen of Wands there you go this again to me is like that Walkin Beauty like the way they see you is very  much in this passionate Queen of Wands energy it's a very sexy energy it's a very like I can't stay away from you kind of energy it's a very like I am so drawn to you I'm drawn to everything you are like your energy your beauty the way you talk the way you move the way you are show up in the world there's just something about you that this person cannot take their eyes off of okay or they cannot take their attention off of king of pen wow there you go see look at this I mean you know this could be if  you guys Divine masculine divine feminine this can be it right here this person wants to be that solid person for you right they want to be they see you 10 of Pentacles they see you as somebody they could marry commit to you know have a committed relationship um build a home build a family they want to be your rock they want this passion and this hunger that they feel for you to push this connection forward into something real that is even more than just this this energy of like you know I want you  energy right it's not just I want you now it's I want you forever and I think that's what this person is grappling with okay that is the action they want to take they don't want this to fizzle out they don't want this just to be some sort of like exciting you know exciting brief you know something that is so passionate but that ends right like they want to take that passion and create something real out of it wow wow love this love this so I think that is their next action is to move this forward into  something that is going to last see what else what else what other action do they wish to take and let's get also what they wish to say about those actions yeah see so this is the thing I think it's like whatever hesitation that they are feeling because of the you know intensity of these feelings I think that's what they are working on to you know come out of yeah so you know I feel like this person has definitely experienced you know or doesn't want to if they've experienced loss before which you know we all have like I'm sure  they've had you know connections that didn't work out I feel like for them it's more I feel like that's not as important to them and that's not what's holding them back I don't think it's their past that's necessarily holding them back I feel like they um because they do have memories obviously like we all carry that but I'm not feeling like it's it's something that they're greatly concerned with I feel like they feel they they take the perspective that you know love relationships passion connection is a sacred Journey right  it's a journey that we're all on and sometimes it turns out good sometimes it has twist twists and turns but in the end it's all good I feel like this is their philosophy that all of life especially love um is a sacred journey and it brings us to new places it helps us to experience ourselves in in the universe and this wondrous Universe in different ways and we learn about ourselves so I feel like this person does carry a lot of memories in their heart but they cherish those memories they're okay with the good and the bad I  feel like the only hesitation that they might be having right now is that they don't want to experience a future loss of you like they don't want to lose you they want to do this right and they feel like if they just give in right now to that raw hunger if they give into the raw passion completely um they don't want it to just kind of fizzle itself out okay they they don't want to do this wrong so this person I like their attitude like they they are very okay with where they've been and they're okay  with exploring where this is going with you but they are a little extra careful not to get too hot and heavy too quickly as to not then lose the relationship okay so I think they are trying to take it slow I think like with this car's energy they don't want to rush into it see everywhere I go I look around as if you will magically be there yeah see so they really love that presence that you have okay I feel like also if you are long distance right now because we are getting this journey energy if you are  long distance this is another reason why everywhere they look they wish you could magically be there it's like they want to be in your physical presence okay there is a deep physical connection here as well right like they want to physically be with you they want to be able to touch you hold you you know um Express their uh emotion to you physically in person okay so if you are a long distance I feel like this person does want to travel to you they want to be able to um and I feel like that with that Knight of Cups energy as  well right like traveling to you to express their emotions to express express what they want um to have with you what they wish to build with you to express that they see this actually going somewhere this being something more than just a passionate love affair right you hurt me everything that happened hurt me so much I need more time to heal okay so take this as a special message for any of you who might be in some sort of struggle with this person um maybe because there's been some hesitation maybe there's been some stuff  that's you know some blocks some challenges that have come up um and you guys are kind of in that stage of like okay where are we going next okay so there just might be some things to work out depending on where you are in your journey but I feel like in this person's next actions towards you they are looking to build something solid okay um they are okay with letting this build itself on its own seeing where this goes but they don't want this to be short-lived I think that's the main energy here they don't want this to just  be here today and gone tomorrow they want this to be meaningful so they're taking their time okay so this is what I have for you if you'd like to have a personal reading with me you could do the live or the video recorded you can also order any of the Oracle Decks that I've created and used in this reading and um everything is at Liv tarot.com so make sure you check it out if you haven't subscribed and likeed this video please do that before you go

actions towards you and then I'm not going to say these zodiac signs if you want to know what they are they are timestamped in the box below so let's go ahead and start with your oracle cards what are their next actions towards you [Music] what are their next actions [Music] all right we have re resilience we have Instinct with the wolf we have surrender the habit of  people pleasing speak your needs and be true to yourself focus on your own happiness instead of always trying to make everyone else happy and we have infinite abundance abundance is pouring into your life interesting okay so I feel like this person has definitely been spending a lot of time lately um doing things for other people okay and in whatever those responsibilities are they have started to really feel weighed down by those okay um they've been struggling they've definitely been struggling to be all  things to all people in their life okay so this person may have some family responsibilities um this person for some of you I feel like there might even be a third party situation so either that third party energy is coming from family or family responsibilities or from uh a romantic third party of some situation that this person is in but is feeling like a very heavy burden of unhappiness and wanting to get out of so either way the energy is the same your person has been feeling like they've just taken on  a lot of responsibilities they have a lot on their shoulders for some of you they may even have um kids from a previous marriage you know there's just it it feels like there's just a lot of financial responsibility and a emotional and like um M material responsibility that this person seems to be carrying this reminds me also very much of the T of Wands right energy very similar energy here where you just feel like you carrying this big burden and you're wanting to put it down at some point right so I feel like what your person  definitely regrets that they have not been able to take the kind of action towards you that they want to take okay and I feel like part of the reason for that is also they're just struggling and working very hard for what they need to earn or where they need to be in life to fulfill the obligations okay so I feel like they are definitely feeling very regretful that they've had to please other people before they can please themselves and please you like they've had to put other things and other people over building  the relationship um and the connection with you okay and that's something that they feel like they know that they haven't taken enough action on right action towards you and I feel like they're starting to very much feel in their intuition in their Instinct that if they don't do something to change this soon that they are going to lose you they're going to end up alone or maybe they already have I know it depends on where you are on this journey for some of you you've already stepped back from this person because you  weren't getting your needs met right like you weren't getting your emotional needs met you weren't seeing this person enough you know they probably were not as available to you um maybe they just didn't have enough time to spend with you it didn't feel like a real relationship it didn't feel like it was going anywhere um I do feel that they're very aware of the fact that you know you uh you have felt that there's a stuck energy to this connection like it just feels very stagnant it feels like it's  stuck in one place feels like it's not moving forward so I feel like your person is very aware of that and they are in the state of trying to figure out what action they want to take because they know that non-action or like you know just a few things here and there like inconsistent action is not going to do anything here okay and that you're no longer you're probably at that point where you're no longer willing to accept um inconsistent action you're no longer willing to accept um just being here and  there you know they pop up whenever they want they pop out again you know like you might hear from them you might not like it's very I feel like there's very inconsistent energy from this person towards you not because they want it to be like that but because I think they're just distracted like they they're not prioritizing okay so I think the other issue here that they're coming to realize is that they are not prioritizing very well like if they want love if they want you if they want this relationship in their life then they're  going to have to reprioritize their life okay so let's see are they going to take actions towards reprioritizing this one fell out and it just fell forward actually so we'll take [Music] that what are their next actions going to be so we have this four of Wands I love this and I love the fact that it just fell out face forward it might have been off cam Cera though I'm not sure if the camera picked that up Ace of Wands Queen of Pentacles interesting and The Chariot wow okay wow okay so remember I  said that for some of you I feel like there is some sort of a third party there could be it could be another divine feminine who is showing up here as the Queen of Pentacles this could be a mother a sister a friend a a wife a girlfriend a partner it could be anybody but there is definitely some energy coming up here where your person has to decide with this chariot's energy are they going to move on from this situation okay because with this four of Wands there is a celebration here of a new commitment okay and and with this  Ace of Wands along with this four of Wands I just feel like it's almost like this energy of like they know that they're if this is a third- party situation they know that their next action is in order to have you in order to have you in their life is going to be to move away from whoever this person is and again it doesn't have to be romantic it can be even this can even represent whatever responsibilities your person has to other people to other family or whatever it is but there's something here I'm also getting for some of you  it's some sort of mother or mother figure okay but I like how you see this chariot's energy moving forward away from this person and this person turning their back right and now here you see this Ace of Wands a new way of Behaving a new way of doing things changing your actions is what they want to do right taking new actions towards you with this four of Wands to come to some sort of a something to celebrate a decision a union a new Union a new relationship a new commitment something to celebrate  that you finally reached reached it you've been wanting to reach it you've been wanting this both of you I feel like this is their next action they know know that in order to have this four of Wands to celebrate that with you to feel like they're truly with you and you are truly with them it's not just words it's not just feelings it's not just a fantasy they know that it's time to do something different so I feel like that is what they are working on these new actions um like I said for some of you  that new new action is going to be moving on from this person if this isn't a third party situation I feel like they want to make you you this person right like this this is also energy of spouse and partner right so and this is the energy of celebrating a commitment to a new spouse and partner because now you're moving on together in life you're doing it together okay so this person is preparing themselves to take action and that action is going to be moving on from whatever is this this 10 of Wands  energy moving on laying the burden down and moving forward in order to have this commitment with you okay let's go deeper what else is coming through here in their next actions and then let's get some specific message of what they would say about those actions okay so we have balance beautiful see that's what this person needs they need to regain their balance because again I feel like whatever burdens they're carrying on their back is robbing them of that balance okay it's making them feel like  they're just going to fall over so I love the fact that this person's next actions is to bring their life back into balance which is very very necessary because I think this this habit of people pleasing and not taking a stance not drawing boundaries especially if it's a third- party situation not having boundaries set with that other third party saying look I will not tolerate any of this BS anymore okay I'm I you know I will fulfill whatever my responsibilities are to you but I'm not going to tolerate anything else I'm not  going to try to please you anymore is going to be a big boundary that this person needs to set because see I just feel like you bring out that joy in this person I feel like you bring out that youthful Spirit they feel like a kid again with you they feel happy playful they enjoy the present moment with you you provide that escape um from the drudgeries of their everyday life from the burdens of their everyday life that they're constantly caring you make them believe that it's possible to be free  and happy again you know that life doesn't have to always be a struggle you remind them of that and you help them get over that fear because I do feel for again for those of you especially with this fear coming underneath that Queen of Pentacles I just feel like if there is some sort of a third party um like I said doesn't have to be romantic uh there is some sort of fear that this person is trying to get over in terms of confronting this person okay there's some something this person is afraid of like will this person do  something will this person be disappointed will this person retaliate will this person try to get revenge on them or will this person person cause drama unnecessarily there's just something there okay there's something there so I feel like they are trying to in their next actions in order to come forward to you with that chariot's energy in order to celebrate this new beginning with you they know that they're getting over the fear of whatever this person or this situation can create okay um and if it's  not that third party it's just getting over their own insecurities to do something differently with that Ace of Wands right take different action and to get out of whatever they are in denial about so again see this is why I feel like there are definitely some things here that your person may be repressing that they're in denial about um either about their own fear or blocks right about the way they need to please other people about the way they might be entertaining this person when they don't  need to anymore right like why are they still holding on to pleasing somebody else right and that's where the denial and the repression is going to have to come to the surface okay it's going to have to come up and come out um and I feel like they're willing to do that that's also part of their NE next actions to get real to get real with themselves so they can be real and honest with you I worry that you've moved on and this is all in my head is it do you still think about me see that's why I said for some of you you may have Ste  stepped back from this person already you may have disappeared from their life and given them the opportunity to see what life is like without you to miss you right so um I wouldn't be surprised like you know like they're obsessed with you like they can't stop thinking about you especially if you have you know walked away from this because they couldn't seem to get their act together they're always pleasing other people and not themselves and you my fantasy or my fantasy I have pictures and videos saved  of you and I and use them for inspiration I want you yeah see so again I just feel like this person is definitely kind of obsessed with you and I just feel like they want this four of Wands it's just a matter of okay we need to get over some of these struggles so so we can get to this celebration but I feel like that is exactly where their next actions are okay that is where they are headed because of this Chariot okay this is moving forward for sure so this is what I have for you if you'd like to have a  personal reading with me you could

S182	https://youtu.be/vOeWPPmh3Ekff?si=p6P1efEkh378mGuf	yeah we met last year I was a white girl with SPS I changed meanwhile from a white woman to a black woman you can't do that yeah no this is not this is real this is melanotan no no well it's a relative of that it's an msh stimulator so what is melanotan or an msh stimulator well an msh stimulator is melanocyte stimulating hormone and this can actually stimulate your body to create melanin and melanin is the pigment that gives her skin a darker color so I have more pigment than somebody who's let's say a redheaded  Irish person and somebody who's African-American has more of that pigment than I do and melanotan is an injectable substance that can cause the body to create more melanin making the skin look darker this is real pigment they injected this in you yes yeah they gave you an injection I had the same treatment but for me it don't work so well they're both doing this now the interesting thing about melanotan is that technically now what people use to darken their skin is called melanotan 2 and this is actually a black market  product it is not available for use in Europe Canada or the United States it's not technically legal for use yet people are injecting it under their skin as a way to make their skin darker there are major risks that can be associated with this injection including skin cancer and interestingly enough some people actually use it for erectile dis function as well still in the it's so it's in a testing phase so it sounds like they're getting experimental melanotan 2 type of injections which is something you should definitely stay  away from I don't think I'm going to wake up and going oh no I need to go back very soon no no I I'm going to stay black this is so wrong that I honestly don't really have much more to say about this other than just don't do it now if this is the number five most shocking patient I would be interested to see what is number four having this perfect booty has brought me to another level of success with making money like Instagram model Instagram influencer you know it's my money maker she has a big bonad donk  but is this due to surgery or is this completely natural let's find out a little bit more how did you get a buck like this well originally I wanted to get a BBL and I did a round of hydrogel shots hydrogel is a general term to any gel-like substance that is made of mostly water technically some of the fillers that we use today like ha fillers are basically hydrogels hydrogels can also be used with wound care and so let's get a little bit more information on exactly what type of hydrogel she may have had injected into  her where where was it done in a hotel it was like a basement of a medical spot you could see like the cans there was like canisters and it was like jelly looking stuff hyd it wasn't that doesn't sound like a medical type of a treatment to me there are a lot of bad things that people get injected into their butt when they're in basements when they're in hotel rooms and things like that hopefully shouldn't have one of those things injected sounds like you had maybe or something from you know we see  a lot of flat she laughs but there are people who've had literally fix a flat injected into their butttocks how they do this is beyond me like I don't know if you have to take that canister of fix a flat and then EMP it out into a container and then inject that or if you literally take the pump from a fix the flat and attach that to a needle and put that into somebody's butt I don't know but it actually has been done I want to look like a doll with full lip so i' had three rounds of lip filler when I was 17  years old three rounds when you're 17 years old if you are 17 years old in order to get this type of a treatment done at a medical facility you need an adult to sign off for you your Your Guardian which essentially is your parent so that's why it was kind of controversial when Kylie Jenner came forward and said that she had her lips injected when she was a minor that meant that Chris or Caitlyn must have signed off on the dotted line for Kylie to get her lip injections as did this person's parent as well would you sign off on  your 17-year-old getting lip injections I definitely wouldn't but it's becoming a problem because I'm getting them done so often there's some nerve damage going on like drinks are literally falling out of my mouth because I can't feel the cup that is really bad now I'll tell you a similar thing happened to me a long time ago and it wasn't from my lips beting injected I've never had filler injected to my lips but I actually had my jaw broken and set back between my high school and college Years and that  surgery did create some numbness of my lower lip and I would find at times afterwards that I would be in class let's say in college and there would be drool dripping from the side of my mouth and I had no idea that it was happening to me now luckily I never had food that was falling out of my mouth but the drool is really bad what do you think you have in each lip right now five in the top five in the bottom so I think he means five CC's or syringes in the top and five in the bottom lip that is a lot  of filler normally when people come to my office and they get their lips filled usually will do at the most one syringe of the upper lip and one of the lower lip and not uncommonly we would only do a half a syringe on the top and a half below for him to do five syringes on each lip that is a ton of filler tell me if it's sharp when I touch your lips I did barely F that I literally did not even okay so the center again so the nerves of his lip have been damaged from multiple injections as well as possibly from the  pressure of that filler putting pressure on those nerves and causing those nerves not to work the next step if you do more filler into a lip like this is that that pressure can get so high you may not get enough blood supply to the lip the lip can cross meaning that tissue can die it can turn black and he can have literally loss of parts of his lips if you go double what you have now mhm you think your sensation is not great now it's going to be gone and that is completely true now it's possible that if he has  some of that filler melted away from his lips if that filler was from hyaluronic acid he may notice that those nerves can rebound a bit the good thing with nerves is that they can regenerate they can regenerate very very slowly but they can regenerate it's just that they been literally killed off that that could be a major problem for him so stopping the filler and melting some of it away is what I would also recommend would you like to look 5 or 10 years younger but you don't want to go under the knife or  needle well what if I told you that you could use your body's own natural regenerative abilities to turn back the clock in a major way yes it's a process called

life at aoj juvenation the link is in the caption below one of my model friends referred me to a guy her breast look awesome well I mean he was a dentist but I thought he was a doctor she had her breast done by a dentist how  is that legal it can't be legal can it about a year and a half later I go back I want them a little bigger and kind of closer together it doesn't work by the way the reason why Dr de bro says it doesn't work and bringing the breast closer together is that if you have breast implants that are placed underneath the muscle on your chest and this is how we do it in most of our patients to lower the risk of complications the separation between those breasts is caused by where the muscles attached to the sternum or the  breast bone in some people the muscles attached close to the middle and you can get two breaths that are close to the middle like doll partan type breasts in other people those muscles attach off to the side of the sternum and if they are under the muscle there's no way to cause them to go closer to the middle because the muscle is essentially in the way okay I wake up and my boobs like real huge they were like oh we put 1,000 CC's and 1,000 cc's is 200 CC's bigger than the largest silicone breast implants  that are made here in the United States so how they put 1,000 cc's in or they must have taken an 800 CC saline implant and overfilled it to a thousand sea seeds this is insane and that's one reason why you should not have a dentist put your breast implants in I love dressing up as anime characters I love the style when I walk down the street I definitely do get a lot of negative attention but I don't care so she essentially is a human anime character and if you watch anime you know that anime characters typically have really  big breasts with tiny little waists and then fairly wide hips so I'm assuming that this is the direction that she's trying to go for what's the outfit I'm Hestia from is it wrong to try to pick up girls in a dungeon is that what you're into yeah it's actually inspired my plastic surgery oh really this was so funny because the fact is you've got two guys who are like nearing 60 probably and they have no idea what she's talking about anime characters Dungeons and I mean I don't get it either honestly I'm  not an anime guy one week later I started to have fever so then I go to the ER and they told me that it was my right breast that was causing the problem and that it was a staff infection so she had breast implant surgery and developed an infection afterwards this is a really really bad thing if that implant is infected the implant needs to come out the patient needs to then go on antibiotics and you have to let that breast in that pocket heal together for a good 6 months before you put a new implant back in this is  the standard of care when you have an infected implant you cannot put it back in you because it's infected and if you put it back into the breast while it's infected that infection will never clear she could literally get septic and die from it I'm amazed that your doctor took a breast implant that was infected mhm took it out put a smaller one in closed it up what you don't take out an infected implant and put another new implant in that is not the right thing to do and I don't know what her plastic  surgeon was thinking maybe this doctor was a dentist too you're on antibiotics so you don't know whether it's been completely treated or not because you have to figure out whether the bacteria that were in there are just lying dormant are just being suppressed by the current oral antibiotics you're taking that's not a good situation if she's got an underlying infection of an implant and some doctor just keeps giving her antibiotic after antibiotic that can cause that infection to basically just  kind of lay dormant until the antibiotics stop and then it gets a lot worse and the treatment once again is the implant has to come out you got to go a good 6 months without it and then you can put a new one in once everything is healed and that infection is completely completely gone so she want to be a human anime character but what about a guy who wants to be a human Elf or not even a human elf just an elf or like an alien elf and he wants plastic surgery to get there take a peek at this video right up here where I react to an  episode of Bosch with the human elf and remember eat real food use clean skincare and auto rejuvenate before you operate

and they told me that it was my right breast that was causing the problem and that it was a staff infection so she had breast implant surgery and developed an infection afterwards this is a really really bad thing if that implant is infected the implant needs to come out the patient needs to then go on antibiotics and you have to let that breast in that pocket heal together for a good 6 months before you put a new implant back in this is  the standard of care when you have an infected implant you cannot put it back in you because it's infected and if you put it back into the breast while it's infected that infection will never clear she could literally get septic and die from it I'm amazed that your doctor took a breast implant that was infected mhm took it out put a smaller one in closed it up what you don't take out an infected implant and put another new implant in that is not the right thing to do and I don't know what her plastic  surgeon was thinking maybe this doctor was a dentist too you're on antibiotics so you don't know whether it's been completely treated or not because you have to figure out whether the bacteria that were in there are just lying dormant are just being suppressed by the current oral antibiotics you're taking that's not a good situation if she's got an underlying infection of an implant and some doctor just keeps giving her antibiotic after antibiotic that can cause that infection to basically just  kind of lay dormant until the antibiotics stop and then it gets a lot worse and the treatment once again is the implant has to come out you got to go a good 6 months without it and then you can put a new one in once everything is healed and that infection is completely completely gone so she want to be a human anime character but what about a guy who wants to be a human Elf or not even a human elf just an elf or like an alien elf and he wants plastic surgery to get there take a peek at this video right up here where I react to an  episode of Bosch with the human elf and remember eat real food use clean skincare and auto rejuvenate before you operate 
Y182	https://youtu.be/vOeWPPmh3Ek?si=p6P1efEkh378mGufsse	yeah we met last year I was a white girl with SPS I changed meanwhile from a white woman to a black woman you can't do that yeah no this is not this is real this is melanotan no no well it's a relative of that it's an msh stimulator so what is melanotan or an msh stimulator well an msh stimulator is melanocyte stimulating hormone and this can actually stimulate your body to create melanin and melanin is the pigment that gives her skin a darker color so I have more pigment than somebody who's let's say a redheaded  Irish person and somebody who's African-American has more of that pigment than I do and melanotan is an injectable substance that can cause the body to create more melanin making the skin look darker this is real pigment they injected this in you yes yeah they gave you an injection I had the same treatment but for me it don't work so well they're both doing this now the interesting thing about melanotan is that technically now what people use to darken their skin is called melanotan 2 and this is actually a black market  product it is not available for use in Europe Canada or the United States it's not technically legal for use yet people are injecting it under their skin as a way to make their skin darker there are major risks that can be associated with this injection including skin cancer and interestingly enough some people actually use it for erectile dis function as well still in the it's so it's in a testing phase so it sounds like they're getting experimental melanotan 2 type of injections which is something you should definitely stay  away from I don't think I'm going to wake up and going oh no I need to go back very soon no no I I'm going to stay black this is so wrong that I honestly don't really have much more to say about this other than just don't do it now if this is the number five most shocking patient I would be interested to see what is number four having this perfect booty has brought me to another level of success with making money like Instagram model Instagram influencer you know it's my money maker she has a big bonad donk  but is this due to surgery or is this completely natural let's find out a little bit more how did you get a buck like this well originally I wanted to get a BBL and I did a round of hydrogel shots hydrogel is a general term to any gel-like substance that is made of mostly water technically some of the fillers that we use today like ha fillers are basically hydrogels hydrogels can also be used with wound care and so let's get a little bit more information on exactly what type of hydrogel she may have had injected into  her where where was it done in a hotel it was like a basement of a medical spot you could see like the cans there was like canisters and it was like jelly looking stuff hyd it wasn't that doesn't sound like a medical type of a treatment to me there are a lot of bad things that people get injected into their butt when they're in basements when they're in hotel rooms and things like that hopefully shouldn't have one of those things injected sounds like you had maybe or something from you know we see  a lot of flat she laughs but there are people who've had literally fix a flat injected into their butttocks how they do this is beyond me like I don't know if you have to take that canister of fix a flat and then EMP it out into a container and then inject that or if you literally take the pump from a fix the flat and attach that to a needle and put that into somebody's butt I don't know but it actually has been done I want to look like a doll with full lip so i' had three rounds of lip filler when I was 17  years old three rounds when you're 17 years old if you are 17 years old in order to get this type of a treatment done at a medical facility you need an adult to sign off for you your Your Guardian which essentially is your parent so that's why it was kind of controversial when Kylie Jenner came forward and said that she had her lips injected when she was a minor that meant that Chris or Caitlyn must have signed off on the dotted line for Kylie to get her lip injections as did this person's parent as well would you sign off on  your 17-year-old getting lip injections I definitely wouldn't but it's becoming a problem because I'm getting them done so often there's some nerve damage going on like drinks are literally falling out of my mouth because I can't feel the cup that is really bad now I'll tell you a similar thing happened to me a long time ago and it wasn't from my lips beting injected I've never had filler injected to my lips but I actually had my jaw broken and set back between my high school and college Years and that  surgery did create some numbness of my lower lip and I would find at times afterwards that I would be in class let's say in college and there would be drool dripping from the side of my mouth and I had no idea that it was happening to me now luckily I never had food that was falling out of my mouth but the drool is really bad what do you think you have in each lip right now five in the top five in the bottom so I think he means five CC's or syringes in the top and five in the bottom lip that is a lot  of filler normally when people come to my office and they get their lips filled usually will do at the most one syringe of the upper lip and one of the lower lip and not uncommonly we would only do a half a syringe on the top and a half below for him to do five syringes on each lip that is a ton of filler tell me if it's sharp when I touch your lips I did barely F that I literally did not even okay so the center again so the nerves of his lip have been damaged from multiple injections as well as possibly from the  pressure of that filler putting pressure on those nerves and causing those nerves not to work the next step if you do more filler into a lip like this is that that pressure can get so high you may not get enough blood supply to the lip the lip can cross meaning that tissue can die it can turn black and he can have literally loss of parts of his lips if you go double what you have now mhm you think your sensation is not great now it's going to be gone and that is completely true now it's possible that if he has  some of that filler melted away from his lips if that filler was from hyaluronic acid he may notice that those nerves can rebound a bit the good thing with nerves is that they can regenerate they can regenerate very very slowly but they can regenerate it's just that they been literally killed off that that could be a major problem for him so stopping the filler and melting some of it away is what I would also recommend would you like to look 5 or 10 years younger but you don't want to go under the knife or  needle well what if I told you that you could use your body's own natural regenerative abilities to turn back the clock in a major way yes it's a process called

life at aoj juvenation the link is in the caption below one of my model friends referred me to a guy her breast look awesome well I mean he was a dentist but I thought he was a doctor she had her breast done by a dentist how  is that legal it can't be legal can it about a year and a half later I go back I want them a little bigger and kind of closer together it doesn't work by the way the reason why Dr de bro says it doesn't work and bringing the breast closer together is that if you have breast implants that are placed underneath the muscle on your chest and this is how we do it in most of our patients to lower the risk of complications the separation between those breasts is caused by where the muscles attached to the sternum or the  breast bone in some people the muscles attached close to the middle and you can get two breaths that are close to the middle like doll partan type breasts in other people those muscles attach off to the side of the sternum and if they are under the muscle there's no way to cause them to go closer to the middle because the muscle is essentially in the way okay I wake up and my boobs like real huge they were like oh we put 1,000 CC's and 1,000 cc's is 200 CC's bigger than the largest silicone breast implants  that are made here in the United States so how they put 1,000 cc's in or they must have taken an 800 CC saline implant and overfilled it to a thousand sea seeds this is insane and that's one reason why you should not have a dentist put your breast implants in I love dressing up as anime characters I love the style when I walk down the street I definitely do get a lot of negative attention but I don't care so she essentially is a human anime character and if you watch anime you know that anime characters typically have really  big breasts with tiny little waists and then fairly wide hips so I'm assuming that this is the direction that she's trying to go for what's the outfit I'm Hestia from is it wrong to try to pick up girls in a dungeon is that what you're into yeah it's actually inspired my plastic surgery oh really this was so funny because the fact is you've got two guys who are like nearing 60 probably

A184	https://youtu.be/krwc6tKufbE?si=9ogn8Lz1996wIdN3	drop drop good oh my Lord oh my God oh my he's okay he's laughing wow that was really loud that was a huge one oh my God good job man whenever you're ready I'll get you on your other side oh that one went almost as well oh my god oh there's a good one that's a really good one okay that's a happy looking dude there Allie good to see you again today thanks for coming in great to meet you uh Ali is a prospective Chiropractic student who was in shadowing the other week just to kind of get a better understanding of my own personal take on  this profession which you guys would know is that whole Diversified technique um he's also got kind of some full spine I'm not going to call them issues but complaints that he's kind of looking to have addressed cuz he hasn't been treated by a chiropractor before as far as I understand but Allie I'm going to let you kind of talk about it a little bit once don't you go ahead yeah so this is basically my first uh Chiropractic um opportunity in my first treatment in the way um I'm a very active person I'm an  athlete um I have like this wear and tear kind of uh thing going on with my right traps and uh it goes all the way down to my low back so uh in the mornings um frequently is flare ups and then after that I do a little bit of stretching and slowly goes on along the along the day but uh yeah it's always like evident in my right trap like bilateral traps let's say and so so both traps or just the right one okay more so the right are you right-handed as well yes I'm right-handed and uh on my low back as  well okay um I've had a um ACL reconstruction um let's say 4 years ago on my right ACL with the medial meniscus also injury um how's that knee feeling for you these days so the knee is feeling a little like on and off because I'm very active so um some days it bothers me some days it's okay but generally I've just lived to just literally go on through the pain and not just think twice you know because all athletes we can't we can't just rest we have to ain't that the truth yeah so yeah I'm very excited to be here all right well  happy to have you um okay so a couple of questions about that you were talking about the upper traps and then you went down to also talk about like your lower back where are you referring to in your lower back exactly so my lower back my lumbar it's a lumbar spine spinal extensor kind of area um it's just more of spasms like muscle spasms mhm um you said those are worse in the morning or yeah worse in the morning definitely and I feel like because I'm overcompensating to my left because my right knee is  injured then there's something going on there you know what have you done so far for both the you know trap and back complaint and the knee like have you been seeing a physio have you been seeing massage like what how have you been managing or rehabbing through it I've been because I work in a clinic I've been kind of taking my own two cents on it so I've been doing some like uh let's say um just a massage gun for myself a little stretching and uh yeah like maybe morning yoga but not not physial or anything so you haven't been  doing anything formal like seeing a professional not formal this is my first okay so I mean al Ally reminds me actually quite a bit of myself when I was no no truthfully um way back when I was like 15 I used to be a competitive swimmer tore both my shoulders um was biceps tendonopathy on one and a supinatus tear on the other and like I mean I had seen uh physiotherapists I had seen chiropractors uh and and my MD none of them really helped me they didn't really give me much Insight a couple of them would throw me on  machines they show me some basic stretches but to rehab and build back stronger and better that was something that 15-year-old Adam had to figure out himself so I mean it seems like alli's been trying to manage that not sure why you haven't at least tried especially if you work at a clinic why you didn't try approaching them maybe that's something you can do but we can talk about it today too no problem um all the same I'm happy to seem like you kind of managed to recover from the surgery right and I  know you say you're compensating more on your left um of course that's going to come with some uh compensatory changes up and down the chain as well but overall you still seem like you're doing okay at least this is before the examination right um okay so today we will take a look at the fullback uh we'll also do a examination um anything else that you want to talk about or is that that's not like you're cute you need to talk more but like if there is more then like yeah um honestly um it's just multiple sides kind of thing but  mostly more evident in my right trap like this is your main complaint okay but also because of over overcompensating on my left left kind of uh area my left hip started to bother me a little bit all right so the left hip/ low back region and then the right trap those are your primary okay got it got it got it glad we clarified that that's good uh so what we're going to do today then is we'll do a physical exam okay and then we'll find the ways that should hopefully be able to provide you the most relief all right absolutely good  and so let's get started with a very regular and usual ceas fine range of motion exam again Ali was saying he was having more tightness on that right trap so let's get you to start by bringing your chin down to your chest for us good are you getting any of that pulling sensation any tightness here just with that yeah yeah okay now if I push down further is that better worse or the same it's worse worse okay come back up up I want you to look up towards the ceiling now for me how's that movement that's  okay that's okay and what come back and if I pull further that's still okay yeah okay face forward and get you to rotate as far as you can to the left please we've got about so just bring this up good now as far as you can to left we've got about 55 maybe now as far as you can to the right please so we got 45 we've got about a 10° decrease on right rotation as compared to the left uh do you get pain on that or what does that feel like when you rotate to the writer no pain you do it's it's it's Bain and  where do you feel that exactly I feel it right over here all right so he's pointing and again you guys can't see this on camera but he's pointing to that um insertion point of the levator scapula muscle which we're very familiar with on this channel I'll put a diagram up there so you guys can see if you're new I'll get you to tilt your left ear to your left shoulder for me okay so we can get to about maybe 30° 25° right ear to right shoulder we can actually get a lot farther to the right side than we  can to left with this one with 45 degrees versus that alir mention 25 um and you discomfort on either of those movements there um more more tightness when I'm looking to the left and that tightness is on this side you feel it pulling got it I give yourself a really tight hug and I'm going to get you to rotate as far as you can to the left please as far as you can as far as you can any kind of pulling throughout the thoracic spine here with this or no a little bit a little bit okay we can get to about 55  6 de as far as you can to the right please okay we're about symmetrical on the thoracic rotation so that's good all right stand up for me if you please and please try to bend down touch your toes for me as far as you can do you get any of that pulling or pain kind of in the low back as you were talking about I think he was left side yeah yeah little it's actually really interesting cuz just feeling his lumbar Paris spinals this position left side feels like a rock as compared to the right the right's pretty stiff too but wow all  right come back up for me I want you to extend backwards now for me and he just comfort in that movement oh yeah oh it's wor it's worse on bending back and where are you feeling that on bending back kind of like right here so a little bit higher than the low back prop so he's pointing kind of to the upper lumbar uh region not quite into that TL Junction we're super familiar with but we'll examine with palpation and see exactly where he's talking about you can have a SE for me once again perfect was also  saying that he's getting yes that lumbar uh paraspinal tightness so we're going to be looking at that but that was it the right knee that you say my right knee your right knee okay so we'll do a right knee examination too well as as well as the hip and the ankle why because anytime we get extra stresses put through the knee my mind always goes to hip or ankle first even in the cases of post uh post trauma to the region but all the same let's just start with this side with the basic straight leg raise  we're going to take this and we're just going to lift this straight up let me know if you get any low back discomfort or pain with this or any zigging down the leg no it's all good all right slowly lower this down down now please yourself that's okay yeah good all right and we're going to do the same deal on this side we're going to lift this straight up and you discomforting the low back with that hamstrings and not not L bad just hamstring just tightness of the hamstring way more tight than okay and this is notably the  side that has the post uh surgical recovery on the knee and we're getting more tightness in the hamstrings on this side as compared to this that's also made evident by the fact that me pushing on this leg here I can't get it any further okay we're capped at about I'd say what is that 65 maybe 70° whereas the other one we were able to get up to about 80 so 80 is within the normal limits of this but we are definitely decreased by hamstring tightness on our right side all right I bring this up bend the  knee you okay with that bent knee perfect going to push on through is that okay yeah little hip little hip kind of impingement feeling there okay let's do a hip range of motion bring this up internal rotation of the left hip we can get to 45 that's very impressive external rotation let's take a little look see oh we just had a hit pop there didn't we two two okay I wish I wasn't talking that's like the third time that that's happened and I've been talking okay well two on that side let's see if  they happen on this side too and in this case I will shut up this time yeah internal rotation is 45 that's good now let's see external rotation hey allly stop talking no nothing on that side but what do you feel so tight right you feel really tight kind of in the groin adductor region HH really tight okay so it makes sense that given the history of surgery with this knee that all the other muscles are super used to be engaged hold everything stable because obviously the feeling of instability in  a postsurgical knee is not one the body wholly welcomes okay so what kind of stretches are you currently doing for this knee or for this leg excuse me if any the stretches Mobility work primarily um I usually foam roll okay um glutes hamstring quads um I do a little bit of dynamic warmup M and just the regular um stretches to be honest for the hamstrings okay um anything for the adductors cuz like as we you can see just in doing this external rotation that adductor groin group is very much I'm happy with you right yeah so any  thoughts as to what you could include there Mr physio assistant oh yeah 100% good good we'll talk about those later okay um and then what's this I'll take this we'll do the thigh thrust on this side any discomfort in through there not particularly no no C all right all right so allly was mentioning that he's got a lot of soreness like yes in the upper right trap but also a lot of tightness in the lower left lumbar region now I literally felt briefly through this region already just when he was doing  that forward lumbar flexion and yeah it felt like an absolute Rock uh compared to the right side and even here just laying down I can notice a difference in muscle tone are you okay if I just lift this up to visually okay I don't actually see any difference between the two sides but like it's noticeable between the two from a tension perspective and I wish you guys could see that obviously you can't but it's all good still so we'll go ahead and feel through the SI joints and we'll climb up the chain  here okay up yeah okay so you're even getting that kind of tightness up all the way up yep both sides did you get a haircut yesterday man looks fresh thank you okay then you're also mentioning up into this right trap prop that right there okay oh that hurts one of my favorite things about being a chiropractor is when a patient goes oh that spot hurts one My Favorite Things is just poking it more that's what trigger point therapy is guys I'm not being an ass that's literally what we do to manage  it okay so yeah we got quite a bit of tension kind of through the left side paraspinals lumbar all the way up into the thoracic then we're yeah we got some up here too but we're also quite tender up in the right trap proper the muscle belly so we'll adjust in through the t-spine focusing a little bit more pressure onto the left side and then we can also of course do some uh do some massage based work up here I haven't felt his neck yet we'll do that in a bit but and of course we're going to be adjusting that low back too  but for now since he's in the position for t-spine all right so the first time you ever adjust someone Ali there's way to know how much force is needed okay um I think I've I think you've heard me say this already in shadowing but sometimes like I'll have like a 300 lb guy on the table who I could basically just sneeze on and they'd go and then you know 100 lb ballerina who I have to body slam to get them to release uh so we're going to start light with you okay and then gradually add more Force if it is needed  uh if we're able to get anything at all so let's see okay so first things first gonna get you to take a big breath in for me and all the way out all the way out fast good no okay again in all the way out good there's a little one but yeah okay damn we are very very tight up in here yeah want to be in there okay breath in all the way out all the way out sink sink sink good that was a good one H oh my god well done and we're going to do that or we're going to try that on this side now okay this over here  good and in sorry in and fast all the way out good there's a little one hiding there all right so you're almost in the right position here I'm going to actually take this and pull so the shoulder's not super crowded and you can put your head back so that it's not about to fall off the table good bottom leg straight top one's going to be bent good and from this position what I need from you is to first off let's actually kind of right there big breath in all all the way out sink into table drop drop drop good oh my  Lord oh my God oh my he's okay he's laughing wow that was really loud that was a huge one oh my God good job man whenever you're ready oh whenever you're ready I'll get you on your other side that was amazing man it sounded like you needed that yeah I really needed that all right so again almost in the right position here we're going to go ahead pull that get the Shoulder not so crowded boom you can hold right there bottom leg straight top one bent nice sco bit closer please thank you good and from this position  yep you're all good I'm going to get you to take a big breath in and all the way out sink sink sink good oh that one went almost as well oh my God first time CYO damn so as Alie was saying he's tighter on the or gets more pain excuse me on the right trap as compared to the left we're still going to be examining both sides of the neck remember that the upper traps they are here but they connect all the way up into the base of our skull up here so it's good form to feel through the whole region so starting with the  right so you don't actually feel that bad but as we get lower down I'm feeling more and more and that is where we get more and more bulk of the trop muscles that kind of makes sense to me okay ow he says at the very top so maybe maybe my fingers are failing me on this Sunday morning but if we're tender throughout the right side we can absolutely work through that region so you've never had your neck adjusted before right no okay I'm only self adjusted only right so at least you have that level of experience right so what I  need from you yeah we're just going to turn as far as we can to the left and then drop into this hand here okay now from this position I want you just relax as much as you can and good there's a little one right there and I think my shoulder bumps the camera but all good that's a happy looking dude there oh okay good wow that was crazy you lik that huh oh yeah think so not as big as a release as I thought we were going to get but all the same we're going to turn as far as we can to the right I'm going to be  going for this upper segment here this time okay we're going to do that there's a good one that's a really good one okay oh my God and now we're going to try for the left side proper so same positioning for you but different hand and thrust orientation for me there we go W oh my God all right we got quite a bit out of there so a quick note on self adjusters it's near impossible to get the base of the neck oh and the very top of the neck in self adjusting when you self adjust your neck it's easy to get everything  few in between but the issue with that is if we're increasing the range of motion on in throughout one region but we're not restoring that within the full region that's going to lead to increased feelings of tightness in the regions that don't get that same increase right so that is why I'm lucky enough to have job security yeah that's awesome all right all right so in feeling through Ali's back we found that he was quite hypertonic in through this left side here and tender on the right upper trap so what we're going to do is  one of our favorite things to do on this channel is the instrument assisted soft tissue therapy or the sports massage so one once again we like to do this a lot why because it works on the fascia the fascia that sits on top of all of our muscles helps it to helps those structures to slide against one another without creating friction we get adhesion to the fascia we can get repeated stiffnesses of the whole uh of the whole region so we address that with this because not many therapists will address that kind of structure and we're  looking at positive prognosis hopefully right all right so at this point in time of the video I usually like to try to ask the question excuse me the patient to question question about themselves so that they can talk a little bit more and give the audience a chance to connect with them so Ali my question for you today is to tell us something that you find rewarding about your job all right so first and foremost I'm a I'm a physio /yo assistant at a clinic in Saga um one of the things that I feel  very rewarding is to see how the patients like progress and return to their daily living um life and that's very rewarding for me and that's also part of the re actually most of the reason why I I want to be um a chiropractor in the future um so honestly when the let's say a patient comes in like he's very limited uh in terms of his gate is walking um and because he has low backs spasm so um I follow and um the treatment protocols but the supervisors and with their supervision obviously um assist them on the stretching exercise  obviously first couple phase is like pain-free um pain management kind of phase after the pain subsides we do a little bit more strengthening work uh of the hips of the glutes and of the core just to kind of strengthen the the lower uh lower chain um and yeah so after they I I love I love when they say okay this after this session they felt really really good that actually makes me that's the reason that makes me get up in the morning and actually at work right so I I love that part of my job um  100% man like I obviously understand that exactly like when patients are feeling better and they've been struggling with complaints for a while not really able to get better anybody else they see you know other chyos other physios other docks uh it is a very rewarding feeling you know feeling like you're making a difference and taking away someone's pain exactly uh it's nothing's quite like it so absolutely good on you yeah that's why I want to follow in your steps and be a chiropractor one days so yeah  give it some years and you will be yet okay yeah okay I I also really enjoy playing sports the that ties in nicely too oh yeah that's for Co for for for all right so back at the start of this video Ally was talking about getting most of his pain down from that levator scapula insertion point as well as the traps proper so of course we're going to do some MRT because that's like my favorite thing to do for the upper trops and left Scott there are other ways to handle it but this is my prefer preferred way not necessarily my patient  preferred way but I still enjoy doing it so look at actually that's still okay I'm glad we're doing this I get you to look up into the right please good going to take a pointy elbow I'm going to put it right there get you to slowly look down to the left okay good up to right down to left yeah my patients don't like this but they do like the after effects as a general rule of thumb up to right down to left ow flatter me up to the right down to the left and up to right down to left good stuff Face Forward please tilt  your right ear to your right shoulder and left to left good right to right left to left good right to right left to left good right to right left to left good stuff okay just do me a figure just while you're sitting like this can you rotate your head as far as you can to the right please okay so if you can recall from the start of the video Ali was only able to get about 45° to that right rotation one more time to show the camera once again so a little harder to see from that angle but now we're  getting to at least like 75 so that's a that's a 30° increase in C spine rotation just after a treatment session um now one thing worth noting is that a big area of restriction was in that upper right um Atlas axis suboccipital region uh the c-spine different regions of it are responsible for the different we'll call them percentages of movement the bulk of our rotational ability comes from that very top region okay so it makes sense in that after releasing that right upper c-spine region we restore a  lot of that lost rotational Direction on that side okay so that's why we're able to see such a dramatic before and after in this case if we're more consistent about it and if we can find out some sort of treatment plan with the intention of being as um infrequent as possible emphasis on infrequent we should find ways to be able to get him to restore that range of motion and keep it as long as he can between sessions okay so I just wanted to highlight that for you guys at home I want to highlight  that for him too upper region of the sepine that's where most of our rotation comes from if you're having trouble rotating your head it's probably from up there if you're having trouble laterally flexing your head it's probably from lower down okay now let's go ahead and do the other trap as well just to be thorough I get you to look up into the left good and slowly down to the right go ahead sorry we're going to go from up here oh to down there okay people get this wrong all the time no worries up to  the left and slowly down to the right oh my Lord up to left left slowly down to right up to left slowly down to right up to left slowly down to right up to left slowly down to right you'll find no mercy here buddy okay face forward tilt your left ear to your left shoulder left ear good and right ear to right shoulder oh my low left to left you might be well suited booking in for a proper massage my dude right to right yeah I need that yeah left to left right to right yeah left to left I F done right  to right yeah all right good stuff stay where you are for a moment yeah for Aly how did you find all of that wow that was actually mindblowing I like it's crazy to find that distinction from like watching your videos and all always just watching CYO like uh practic videos and actually being adjusted for the first time especially on the lumbar adjustment facing the walls just like exploded that felt really relieving um the neck too cuz I told you about like I self adjust at home my neck but I did  not notice that there is literally like the the areas that you can't get quite simply and I can like literally feel that right so that that distinguish really just it's mindblowing thank you so much hey no worries man amazing I loved it so as Ali said like uh he is a self adjuster and there's nothing inherently wrong with that but for comparison's Point like how well can you massage yourself right you can massage like your whole body but there are regions on your back that you simply can't reach right um it's a similar  comparison point when we're talking about self adjusting like yeah okay you can adjust some of it but there are regions that you just won't be able to reach right and if you want to get those addressed you need some external Force which is most or which is best done by you know another person in this case a chiropractor right um do you have any other questions about anything we did today or anything else you want to talk about thoughts concerns um no not really I just um this guy's amazing please do yourself a favor and  literally just come here it's mind blowing iina I really appreciate Ally he's a regular viewer of the channel now so thank you so much uh for saying that I appreciate it um well we'll talk a little bit more about what you can do to self-manage stuff off screen here and then um you know we'll keep in touch with the whole application whatnot all right so thanks for coming in I appreciate it Alie Take Care thank don't forget to like comment and subscribe thank you Allie

again man for sponsoring this video let's get to it today I'm here with cupcake she is a men's hair stylist out here in Newport Beach actually and so she has been coming to me this is maybe her second or third session about her right shoulder pain because she is in this repetitive movement all the time in an elevated position you want to demo it like that gotcha okay so that is causing her a lot  of shoulder pain right okay so what I'm going to so since because I already know what's going on we're just going to go right into it we're not going to do the mobility test so go ahead and lay down for me cupcake do you want me to lay facing now face up just head right here okay we oh right side okay so let me just check the external rotation real quick oh it's still good okay so let's start with chest and front de ADT Mobility uh like we did last time and then I'm going to actually do what's called a scap lift to help recreate the  space between your scap and your rib cage cuzz I think that's the missing piece for you so let's get to it okay all right we're going to go into podcast mode and tell me how long I've had had your business okay so I've had my business on my own for 3 months now but I've been doing it for a total of 14 years W that's a long time it is a long time have you always been in California no I've been in California for 4 years oh wow so kind of new mhm actually right at Co yeah so I came here like 6 months before Co hit  okay how did that affect you it really hurt I moved here for a hair and then because of Co it shut everything down but because I trained Muay Thai I chucked out a couple gyms right before the world shutdown I was able to like meet friends and clients that needed like services so then mobile cutting became like a really big oh yeah oh my God I was I remember like I didn't go without a haircut for like 2 months yes like super I would have paid anything for they were too they were like you know what like I need to stay  fresh I had I remember I had a guy come here to the not this gym been I had my other gym he came and cut like everyone's hair he made like so much money we should do that here sometimes like a little popup oo would you be down yeah we talk about that later that's actually a good idea that would be really fun a popup yeah faded Fridays oh I love that oh my God The Branding about to go look and buy a chair for you so clearly you got out of Co okay yeah I did and then I um kind of lost that like passion for  hair for a bit cuz I've been doing it for so long mhm then being here it was like let's explore everything and then I got into like the Cannabis industry and like CBD and THC and what it does for the body and inflammation and all that and then that helped me like build like more you know community and then slowly after doing that for two years I was like I missed doing hair she's back so I'm back nice that feels good I took the cup off kind of early because I did see a little like discoloration happening that shouldn't  happen not that it's bad but I didn't want to get it any worse okay I'm going to check your front side trap while you're here just to be a little efficient so what do you like the most about this about what your job doing body work you get to help people we their pain I love that I don't know honestly it's just it's really fulfilling to me and then the aspect of like it's like a puzzle to me it's like oh my shoulder hurts okay like why got to figure it out um but for the most part most people just have the common problems like your  trap shoulder neck pain hips so it gets actually kind of repetitive so when people come inside I'm just like I already know how to fix this but it's still really rewarding actually talking to people too and like learning their story is pretty fun too like yourself okay you ready for this should I be so we're going to do we got to do that sign so let's do I'll set it up so head up on this guy oop and so what's going to happen is we're going to roll this way wait wait wait we're going to roll This Way um so  I can get at your scap and then um I'm going to put a pillow between as as a barrier because I have to get over you and basically scrape between your shoulder blads okay so go ahead and roll this way and so what I'm going to set this up so you're kind of comfortable leg straight here and then this one bent across like that and then yeah yeah that's your pillow is this okay here mhm so this behind your back perfect that actually works out okay so get to use this guy not this guy okay pillow between  us basically just going to start with the dollar knife just to start and introduce it to you it doesn't hurt it doesn't hurt as bad as it looks okay and most of the time girls have higher pain tolerances than guys very true are you ready mhm do your best to relax you're doing fine I'm just reminding you okay that's pretty much it how does that feel I could feel like that tension being pulled out like it's just sitting there yeah so what I'm trying to do is I'm trying to recreate that space between your scapula and your ribs so a  lot of the times when you if you sleep on your side right do you sleep on your right side I do ah so you have all this compression at night yes going into your shoulder going into your scapula into your ribs and so what I'm trying to do is recreate that space and honestly I know I know this because I sleep on my right side too dang it told my watch is in the way okay I'm going to turn nice feels okay mhm two three oh that was a good one four there you go that feels okay yeah it looks I'll send you a clip it  looks crazy cuz it's like this thing is underneath your shoulder blade can't wait to see it but it feels so much better it's pretty immediate cuz the thing is I can't tell you not to sleep so if we can you know mobilize the things and make you sleep and work better that's what we want cuz changing sleep position is probably like the hardest thing I've been trying to sleep more on my back really mhm like flat and then you wake up on your side yeah see at times your body will do what it thinks it's  comfortable a little notot there huh okay feather for okay let's put your hand forward for me okay does it feel any different right now it just feels looser yeah it feels good like really good so how often do you think I should do this for maintenance just so it doesn't come back I mean you work like how many hours a week like I mean here's the thing I'm want to send you a couple workouts mhm or stretches mainly and it should help keep this so for maintenance so I would say if you're good about the  homework every other month well basically what I'm starting is I have this app I'm going to give all my bodyw workk clients their programs there okay and then yours will be no different and you can follow it there basically just communicate to me like if it gets tight and then we'll get you back in here but in theory if you do your homework I should never see you again not that I don't want to but that just means you're doing a good job with the homework when does the app launch it's launched already never set it up for you  yeah I want it please got you [Music] this actually feels really loose right now yeah so at first when you touched it it was like really sore like I felt the pressure and now what it feels like it feels so loose like it doesn't even hurt 
G188	https://youtu.be/e2mo72PGKnM?si=-g7sFOxKKj4Sk_LH	[Music] heel bulb and when she lands all of her pressure lands right here and this is massively massively engorged but it is not filled with fluid this is granulated tissue this is what's happened in the fight against some sort of infection the pus has basically granulated and turned into new flesh and tissue which in turn has also calcified the bone inside her foot so even if we can fix the problem we cannot fix the symptom as in her foot is absolutely massive and we can't do anything about that this is a source of  her pain but she's also got a source of pain right here this is actually you can't see it right now but actually this is full of fluid and puss inside there this is overly extended overgrown so we need to take this back but she's also got a problem here so we can't simply put a block on here and take the way off here that's a lot of talking about one foot isn't it right let's crack on what we're going to do is attempt to get a block onto the inner claw because that is the best way to get our foot off this  part of our foot no that's the best way to get our weight off this part of the foot so we're going to trim back the end of this toe because I can actually see if you look closely this is only wall horn it's actually sticking out over the end so I know there's no blood supply whatsoever there so we might as well just simply trim it off using these Nippers look as I'm doing that actually I can see that's not even attached look so we can get our Nippers in here as well and take that away obviously we can do this with the  grinder there's no reason not to I'm just simply doing it with this to show you guys that it can be done with the Nippers right I'm going to investigate this foot and see if I can get a block on to be honest I don't know if this is an issue or not yet I'm hoping that it's not right so I'm taking the grinder here to flatten off the base of our sole we're removing hardly any material here but it needs to be completely flat for the block to adhere properly and now I'm working my way around the side of this  hoof because and this isn't something you've seen me do before we are going to build up the wall horn using the glue to give real stability and strength to this claw you need to do everything you can to get that foot as high up off the ground as possible because even if there is a height difference between the two claws the sore one is going to sack down and still touch the ground so we do remove as little as we possibly can from the SLE of the hoof but we do remove enough to make sure that the block is  100% bonded on there right with that said let's get this foot completely dried off get the glue in position squish that block on and then fill up this portion of the wall horn we're making sure it's completely full here and then once it's done we'll smooth it in with the grinder to make sure it doesn't catch on anything and flick back off we'll leave that glue to fully Harden before we shape it up a little bit with the grinder there's Robbie in the background say hello Rob Robbie yeah right yeah that was hello in teenager right so  all of this is flapping away in fact actually this is this is too so we're going to get rid of as much of this as we possibly can so the anatomy of this isn't usual inside it's not standard so we have to trim it in a completely different ways to what we normally do kind of reanalyzing well we normally reanalyze constantly anyway but being more cautious than ever because at any moment this could go through to corium which obviously we don't want we just want to get these layers of detached torn out of the way and reduce the size  of this claw as much as we can you can actually see that because this foot is so sore she's ended up with a sore foot on her back right foot which we've had to block just before we Trimm this boot there's an ulcer in there and that's because you've been walking on this boot too much to get the weight off that foot there when we lifted this foot there was fluid coming out of here somewhere I really don't want to cut into anything but I do want to make sure that it's not trapped in there at the same time  so and then a bit of a conundrum so there is actually some peeling and detached to Horn here and her the Coronet the the hairline which we want to get rid of as well obviously okay so let's peel away at the top ERS of this as gently as we possibly can in an effort to let any pressure that is in here out you can see how uh how not not scared of it but cautious I'm being this bit right here is the heart of the problem but also up in here there's still under attach your phone which we need to get rid  of right oh I was just about to say right we'll leave it at that when look what's happened right so because of that I'm going to take another little Slither yeah and there you go pass ding right down perfect that oh my God just look at this sinking in now look at that that is unbelievable that absolutely stinks just going to see if I can open that up just that little bit more without doing any more damage but letting that pressure out this is unbelievable I did not think that was going to Kev can you push this with me get  your get your fingers right there if you push there and I'll push here okay so we I said we reanalyze the situations and we are reanalyzing this one constantly um to try to do a better job with this we' need to remove a huge amount of live tissue to actually open that right up so all we are going to do is clean this out and treat it with an antibiotic spray that's already here at the farm um and then we'll recommend the vet the vet seeds this car because just look at that look all this pus Flo out here is unbelievable but look at the  cavity it's left behind I can tell from the feel of it that this is completely live tissue and for us to open that up we'd open this cow up to all sorts of even worse Fates so what we're going to do is we're going to wash this away and I said we weren't going to put another Block in here but we're actually going to put another wooden block on top of here and really shape it so the back of it is higher than the front so that she's really walking on here and completely off the side jeez oh right how's that smelling Robbie  disgusting I've never smell something like Robbie certainly wasn't wrong this really did smell absolutely horrendous this is essentially Rotting Flesh pouring out the bottom of this poor cow's foot I'm really glad we've been able to do more than I first thought we would with this cow because I really thought all we would be doing would be gluing on a block and letting her go when I first started filming this cow I honestly never thought that was pH of puss because it I wasn't wrong I've never been  wrong I've been wrong but I wasn't wrong when I said this is granulated tissue this is extremely hard the um the ball of her foot and that is something that can't be fixed releasing that pressure from this foot will have helped the cow a lot but it still won't healer right time to kind of shape up that wall horn that we filled with glue earlier on this really isn't the standard for hoof trimming but over the years I have definitely done this on numerous occasions when you apply a block to a cow's foot that foot  needs to be in as good a condition as it possibly can be the larger the soul area the greater weight that it can bear that portion of the wall horn reduce the capacity and the ability of that inner claw to take a block effectively I want to make sure this block has no negative conations on this guy's foot so replacing the missing material with my glue is pretty much the only option okay so we're not going to wrap this fot we want everything to come out of that hole I mean look at it that pus is still  leaking out constantly we're going to spray as much of this antibiotic will spray up in there as we possibly can lovely so I no we didn't show you have p on my face cuz I can smell it have anyway now yeah I've still got p on it don't wor right that is still drying slightly so can't remember what I'm saying that back left which you had which I didn't show you us trimming had an ulcer we blocked that so that will take a lot of the pressure off that outside back left claw this about right foot has needed  more attention than we first thought and putting these two blocks in place and building up the wall horn should really really help take the weight and the pressure away from the outer claw so she should walk really well compared to what she was before but like I said for we cannot fix [Music] this as she comes out of the crush here actually she's walking much better than I was expecting she's really able to use those double blocks and that is taking the weight and pressure away from the sore effectory CL guys you've been  watching the Hof GP if you enjoy enjoy M be the wrong words if you find videos like this

S190	https://youtu.be/jSp6ES2YliU?si=ToRn8DpEtPDGFEiW	all right guys what we're doing today is a lot of Gunner react segment stuff but an interesting topic it seems that uh people from my past videos that I've covered before are all kind of finding themselves in new hot water we just covered Chile decastro going to jail for 6 months I mean that one's pretty crazy and then another one we're looking at is Derek grz who might be a predator I mean it's it's weird that people I get into beef with that they end up either going to jail or maybe being Predators it
 
 seems a little higher sticks and I thought it would be when I first got into this whole YouTube gang YouTube game I mean there could be YouTube gangs too that's that's a fraudi and slip I mean I don't know what people are capable of on this platform all right so Derek grz is uh this guy this guy right there quick backstory uh me and Jake dittle made a video together where we made fun of him doing uh door Dash pranks in college where he just like spill the food and stuff it was whatever and then he uh challenged to fight me
 
 which was so weird he like tweeted at me I'm giving you two options pick wisely under Cline you have 24 hours to accept my boxing match or I'm going to drop the greatest hit single on your fat ass I am Derek RZ call my bluff call my bluff your viewers are all six-year-old Roblox virgins an epic tweet an epic lay tweet had this one it just burned into my mind at this point I didn't respond and he never dropped the diss track I was very disappointed I was super disappointed he never dropped it I was
 
 so excited sucks anyways I think this is a fun video 30 minutes to me just kind of going over his live stream where he's looking at me and Jake's video uh yelling just nonsensical mostly just calling us fat and gay the whole time not exaggeration who's the F he's just he's just like an 18-year-old annoying streamer but apparently he's kind of gotten like into this whole kick Predator Fiasco and I had no idea until uh people very nicely let me know in Discord so there was something I'm sure you guys have seen
 
 this something about chickens posted to catch a kick Predator basically exposing this guy whoever the is Riot something and like he's actually a predator predator like I think he was you know it was like very young girls on like Omega or something and he was lying about age and stuff I don't know too many details um but regardless this kind of brought up people looking to other people on kick that were predator esque and Derek Raz in the mix so we're going to watch a video called Kick's biggest
 
 predator by streaming Spotlight who oompaville also referenced in his video covering it too I haven't seen any of this so we're doing some live react baby predator it's fun let's go let's make it funny um wow all right this is some horrid God damn this is so much worse than I thought this would be it turns out it was kind of hard to make that funny at least at first the video we watched was from streaming Spotlight and it was a text to speech voiceover of Derek's alleged sex crimes one he's actually admitted to and I think it just
 
 showed a little bit too much context if you get what I mean like way too much context that we didn't need to see I feel like we should be watching this in dereck's response that we look at after though he's responding and reacting to another YouTuber called the Asher show who makes a video going over the same allegations in this video but does it in a much better and more digestible way so before the funny part of Derek just being really stupid in his response I need to catch you up on the context and
 
 clips that I watched beforehand so you know what I know before we watch that video together does that make sense I I I hope that makes sense first Derek makes weird sexualized live stream content this I already knew yeah this was the weird thing about his streams it's like it's like horny like we're talking about before kick was even a platform he's been doing this for a long time he did this on Twitch two Derek had secret streams where he invites girls over and had a hidden camera set up where he aggressively
 
 tries to get with and does eventually end up having sex with them on his hidden camera live stream with a lot of people watching uh this is a crime in all states in the US I'm going to hell I'm going to hell internally BR I'm up wait think us is so how do you even how are you even aware that what you're doing is up and you still do it you're ubering because why because Jesus only 5 minutes in there's still 18 minutes left of proof I wonder how Derek responds to this I'm so curious I kind of want to
 
 skip to that now but we'll we'll keep watching so what's the point of coming this Jesus dude I just don't kiss I get ahead and put my feedback is his goal to have sex on camera right now like is that how little like he gives a about kick to thanks AI guy his response to this has to be that it's fake obviously I try to keep this light but this is so much worse than I thought it was I I I thought this was could plan it off buddy oh my God no way I just was the whole entire thing oh my God bro okay no way I just I
 
 just live streamed an essay what the hell no way I just live streamed a crime what no way I could go to jail for this what the why did I live stream this and finally Derrick is accused of sending nudes and sex tapes of his once ex-girlfriend to a mod in his chat for money uh and since it was an older relationship his ex-girlfriend would have been some 16 years old in these photos and videos therefore under agage and therefore selling child p word that's also a crime in all states too if you didn't know that one just there's
 
 also leak screenshots from Derek on his live streams that show a Twitter DM conversation verifying the ex-girlfriend's name that he sold these nudes of allegedly we see a video I mean okay with that out of the way a lot of this will be brought back up in Derrick's response to the Astro show but now you're caught up in what I knew going into what we're about to look at right now you can watch the full video from the first one from streaming Spotlight in the description as well as the full video from the Asher show which
 
 is what we're going to be looking at Derek looking at right now also linked in the description now on to Derrick's response apparently we have a video of Derek Raz responding to the allegations too uh I'm sure he'll take that very seriously this is his video a kick streamer who has been falsely accused oh god dude I I'm just already a description I'm a 19-year-old streamer who's been streaming since I was 16 I am not a terrible person I'm young and most importantly human all all humans make mistakes I'm sure everybody watching
 
 this video has made an irrational decision and later regret it I admit my faults and take full accountability of my actions and what I've have done wrong I reflected and became a better person I just currently reflected and became a better person just now on other words I was painted as an awful human being which is not the case these were things in that interet video that were not true in the whole entire video even starting from the start paint me as someone I am not a lot of this was completely taken
 
 out of content which is resulted in a kickban he's really not good at spelling that was also something that we went over a long time ago all right Derek what do you got to say I'm not watching this whole thing it's 30 minutes but let's do a little bit hello everybody so the reason why I'm making this video today is because my name was painted in a very bad Spotlight um and I wanted to go over it with you guys and tell you guys what the truth is this is unfortunately the loudest this goes you you're making an apology video
 
 and you couldn't make the volume loud enough come on man come on now know me um basically my name is drick RZ um I'm a streamer and I've been streaming for 3 to four years now um I started streaming on Twitch when I was around 15 to 16 playing fortnite and just playing video games so right now my content consists of you know just Discord calls um playing video games here and there you know doing like just challenges you know um YouTube Vlog what is this a job interview dude like the way he comes off is so
 
 bizarre yeah no I I'm not doing any hidden camera uh uh sex stuff uh sex crimes I'm doing I'm just doing challenges I'm doing I'm doing Discord calls I'm doing snap chat challenge calls that's what it is it's not I'm not actually doing anything bad um interaction content with my chat so basically on live streams you know I would have people over I would talk to them talk to my chat um I would play video games talk to my chat this is how I talk to like an an or uncle about how I stream so basically I'm just
 
 interacting with my chat and we do we do games talk to me dude did you do the crimes or not so basically as you guys know a lot of things have happened recently um and I don't want to waste your guys' time so I'm going to react to this video on 30 minutes long 30 minutes long too late for that but let's get back into his streaming career because his terrible Tik toks and his thirst traps on Instagram aren't the problem it's okay so off the bat before even getting into what I did um should have reacted to this dude not the AI man I
 
 agree but oompaville used the AI man as credit so I looked at that video we should just watched this video this video looks way easier to get through this YouTuber tries to frame me as just some like sexualized person um showing my cringey tip Tik toks and then even even the little thing frame you as some sexualized person bro that's all of your Tik toks it's not framing you you're in the frame that we're looking at if that's if that's what you mean by frame yeah literally you you do sexualizing content even the little
 
 things like showing my you know my gym picture and and saying it's a thirst trap like I'm I was confident going to the gym um and showing off what I worked very hard for my body so even trying you're being accused of sex crimes bro this isn't the right argument your first argument is that you're confident in your body there's there's heavier stuff here man this is a weird way to start I understand that my Tik toks were cringe but at the time and this is still how I pay the bills this this this Tik Tok
 
 account has gotten almost $500,000 and I started a viral Trend so I understand that it is cringey but at the same time it's what's helping me out and helping my career out and as far as the gym pictures go it's not a thirst trap it's it's it's something that I worked for and I've been proud of my body so I'm showing it off cuz most of my viewers are a male audience oh my god dude he's so dumb he's just so dumb that he doesn't know how to address criticism the whole thing that's happened so far only thing
 
 is the guy has said this is Derek grass he makes some sexual content here's then then this is going to transition to the actual problem which is his secret streams just own it yes you make sexual content that's it off the bat he's trying to make me look like a sexualized person but that is not at all you are girls doing the next stream is literally you shirtless is cooking up with a girl yes you are oh my God he's so stupid yelling at people in Discord calls personally I was just saying I'm not start de over a I'm right here
 
 right now he even gave up the occasional advice wow it's so much easier to flirt with a girl when you have again this was taken out of context this was a joke in my chat um he still this video is still trying to before he get to what I did he trying to frame me as just this terrible human being but this was not true at all um at the time I love my girlfriend a lot I would I wouldn't cheat on her so again this is a joke in my chat and before getting into I don't believe you I just I just do not believe you but
 
 somewhere along the way he gets an indefinite ban on Twitch U my name is Derek G um I was a streamer on Twitch I had about like 50,000 50,000 followers um and you know they was starting to do a career for me um and on January 27th U my account Derek RZ was it definitely suspended oh yeah this is the lore I don't know about so he already got banned from twitch before I think he got banned that was a clip that me and Jake laughed at in his video is that he said he got banned from twitch from Instagram
 
 from uh Facebook from Tinder and we laughed at it we're like how are you banned from every single platform at 18 years old like you got to be doing something wrong don't you think I taking out the industry tried to get rid of me call me put on or I wnab be but you can't knock me off my grind but it's fine in his own words he still has YouTube and Tik Tok to grind he even made a promo video talking about his move from twitch to you picking up girls on Tinder while fighting with their girlfriend on the
 
 phone is crazy also like I'm also friends with him it's not like some random guy I've again in out of context clip where this Creator tries to make me look a terrible human being um if you watch me and have watched a stream you know in this exact clip um my girlfriend at the time did matter in fact cheat on me so me and my chat were just you know playing the game in joking around because we found out that she cheed me in this exact stream so I'm not a terrible person what what what is this defense I don't
 
 even know what that means all he says is everything's a joke no it's not everything isn't a joke I you can tell when he's when he's doing a joke but it's like double layered as it being real he does that all the time like he'll say some awful say it's a joke but he also believes it at the same time that was scripted it was F kick we're good bro don't worry not happen we're good I see now he's just doing a joke like the same thing we saying before like oh kick it's it's all scripted kick don't shut it down it's
 
 all scripted kick don't worry that's a joke but it's also not because it wasn't scripted that's the joke his joke is doubled see that's good content oh until he got banned on YouTube as well banned on YouTube for 7 days and leading into this video it almost tries to make again he tries to paint me as a terrible character um showing all these out of context Clips showing all these clips from months and months he's really trying to go with the out of context thing dude what show the context Derek
 
 show it you're being accused of sex crimes Derek potentially spreading child porography you should maybe show the context this is a better video to watch honestly even him watching this video I like this guy it's not I got banned on YouTube because someone in my chat had posted a a nudity in my Discord server um from I don't know like a um only and I love my community I love my community like we do whatever man uh so someone just posted some nudes in my Discord you know as they do as my Discord does a
 
 yeah he's trying to act so adult that's what got me banned so it wasn't from my actions in what I did on YouTube to get me banned it was because just something that I showed by accident on so yes it was your actions you showed a nude on your live stream that's still your fault what turbulence check what okay I don't know what's this from and again these clips I'm not ashamed to say that's what I do that's what makes me happy God it's I just just for anyone anyone who ever has allegations of sex
 
 crimes of illegal sex crimes potential potential essay uh a spreading of child p word you don't start with trying to defend you doing the helicopter dick that's just no one gives a that's just who I am I'm the helicopter dick guy that's just what I do and I'm proud of that I'm not ashamed of that you're being being accused of some very serious stuff here Derek you got banned from your only platform that makes you money this guy's trying to paint me as a sexual deviant I'm proud of the helicopter dick though that's pretty
 
 cool I can helicopter dick with my shirt I can do that but uh but this guy's trying to paint me in a weird light I'm not this sexual guy I'm proud of my body I'm proud of my body and I you know it just so no one gets me trying to be a hypocrite here yes I threw around the idea of doing a boner stream I'm not going to say that that wasn't going to be a sexual stream though all right you're not catching me any you're not catch a't hypocrisy for me dear Derek grz your account has been temporarily suspended due to breach of terms of
 
 service reason sexually explicit content if you've been banned on three separate platforms why would you continue doing exactly what you're doing well again the reason why I was banned on Kick um for sex supicious content for that time was because I was on omegal um and I strolled past you know a guy put it I I scroll p a guy jerking off I don't want to say that I'm sorry for you you know saying I will piss a guy for jerking off and I was I really don't want to say that that's really that's really hard for me to say the guy
 
 who just did helicopter dick that's really hard for me to say a guy jerking off that's very difficult for me to even to even say the guy who's been banned three times for sexual content this is very difficult for me dumb and didn't delete the VOD so back to what I was saying again it's just he's trying to put all this clips and make me seem like a terrible person yeah we know it's a lot of cont this time per I get banned for anything I got banned for just me showing something stupid on stream um
 
 and not doing the VOD fast enough yep yep yep yep yep shows a video where the streamer and part owner of kick train Rex donated $5,000 to him train Rex donated $5,000 that's a lot of love take 5,000 for that level of Love brother basically while he's doing a horny isn't train Rax like in his 30s owns the company you're donating to this dude what oh maybe he was just randomly donating to people on the platform but he's like literally in the middle of one of his streams that we were talking about before where he's got a girl over
 
 just doing horny like even their sub goals on the side in this stream on the side five Subs equals make out 10 Subs equals lick whipped cream and get cream pied face 20 Subs reflex challenge 50 Subs try not to fold challenge 100 Subs sleep stream with TTS 200 Subs matching tattoo 400 Subs Bella's underwear 500 Subs equals release of tape he's like in the middle of a horny stream this is even like trying to get you it's just it just is the stream you're doing basically giving him a pat on the back for streaming on Kick and
 
 tell yeah absolutely when your owner is giving you money for that that's crazy two years ago I was banned on Twitch for no reason no timing nothing my account was just gone I felt hopeless so depressed for months my life went from the highest point crashing straight to the bottom the feeling Cann not be described how bad I felt I don't think Ki realizes how many people they pulled out of depression and gave them hope to be a success uccessful Creator and chase their I don't think kick Real is how many people they've saved from
 
 depression I mean yeah a bunch of that would have been banned on Twitch like you that's like 10 people I mean I don't I don't know how many people they've saved for depression what dreams I don't know why he said that he was banned for no reason there was a reason and he knows what it was because he admits it in his apology video to Twitch now I don't understand why this part was even addit in the video during this time period um I was I think I would say around 16 years old and um I was permanently banned on Twitch
 
 and during this time period I I dropped out of school um me and my girlfriend of 3 years just broke up my friend crashed my car I basically dedicated my whole enre my whole entire life into my streaming career and got it all taken away from me just like this and during this time period I genuinely was so depressed and suicidal and just so lost in life way to flip it way to flip it dude I don't know why this is being included I I was suicidal back then it was included we're talking about your banned for nudity why did you get banned
 
 let's focus on why did you get banned that's what we're looking at and this was probably the most terriblest time during my life terriblest and the fact that this Creator is turning oh my God that against me and what oh my God he doesn't know that no one knows that he's not turning that against you he doesn't know that he's not laughing at you saying oh look he was he was suicidal he's crashed his car he was was having the most terriblest time of his life he's pulling this up to show that you got banned from
 
 twitch 2 years ago for sexual explicit content I was going through a lot you know kick just opened up I was grinding I was streaming a kick every single day trainer came in my chat gave me over $8,000 this was posted on dextr and just so many big news articles and his creator is trying to come at the time when I was depressed and turned that against me oh my God you so so ire video so far has gone at you're so dumb and so stupid like to follow his train of logic is just so idiotic my lowest of lows and made me
 
 look like a terrible person and then now he's even coming at my high points in my career and just oh no not your high points okay well then when can we come at you if we can't come at you at your lowest and we can't come at you at your highest when when can we come at you is you just never that is just not okay in any aspect at all oh dude you called you you called me and Jake fat and gay for like 30 minutes you were you you were incessantly an now I sound like him because I can't say words incessantly an you're a bully
 
 you just are like there's footage upon footage of you just being the worst person you can't take the high and mighty Road especially when he's not even coming at you for that he just said you you got B booted off twitch two years ago I got this post on my subreddit r/ thee show that read you should consider covering the streamer he's just as bad as Riot LW and if you remember RI L is a person I talked about previously that would secretly record women exposing themselves on camera and post it in his Discord server so let me
 
 go through this one part at a time kick streamer Derek grass has been exposed for secretly streaming girls via hidden camera performing sex acts so Dereck would have streams where he would go through his Snapchat opening pictures that girls would send him exposing their nudes to people people watching his streams and when he got away with doing this he decided to ramp it up he would match with people on Tinder invite them over so basically like this guy's like basically like he's kind of just saying
 
 everything like is is like it's kind of like all out of it's kind of just like out of uh fully out of like it's kind of just like uh like out of context it's kind of just like out of context like what you don't get here is that like I'm actually a good person he's trying to frame me in a bad light is what's is what's happening um I was also suicidal and filmed everything that so again that Snapchat allegation is also a false allegation there has never been a single time in the four years I have been
 
 streaming that I've ever exposed a nude on Snapchat um my Snapchat streams consist of me just swiping up on you know people's public story um or St them like just like stupid cringy you know corny pickup lines and just corny trying to rise them up as a joke this clip again what this Creator just said is fully not true not true at all again there's never been a point in my life that I've showed any type of nude on Snapchat on Snapchat wait what did what did Astro show say exactly so Dereck would have
 
 streams where he would go through his Snapchats opening pictures that girls would send him exposing their nudes to people watching his streams and when he got away with doing this he decided that maybe I don't know a single time in the four years I have been streaming I would be surprised I mean you know honestly all that says to me is that he didn't get nudes like cuz a Snapchat is you don't know what the it is before you click on it it just shows the Red Square he's trying to get these girls to
 
 send nudes that I know for sure we've seen that so if they didn't send you nudes they didn't send you nudes if they did you would have shown a nude on your live stream that's just what that's just what would have happened so you got no Riz is what I'm saying basically okay so now that he's painted me as this type of person um now in this video he's going to get into the mistakes that I've done um and now I am going to let this full entire clip play out because I want you guys to you know see what happened I
 
 don't want to hide anything um this is the you know one point in my career that I did truly mess up um and I want you guys to just fully see it and I want you guys to watch it and I don't want to hide any of it on my account on my so that was real all right yeah case closed case closed we've seen this this this okay if he admits to it Case Closed dude you're a creep you you committed a sex crime you use a hidden camera sexually pressured a girl into giving you a hand job when she wanted to leave and you did
 
 it on camera and you kept it on and you admit to it you shouldn't be allowed anywhere you should be banned yes you're trying to admit to it cuz you want to get back on Jesus this isn't a small thing that you just like oh I I what he say in his in his uh description he said I reflected and became a better person dog in this stream in that in that live stream you literally say before you set up the hidden camera I'm going to hell I know I'm going to hell you knew it was bad I'm going to hell dude this is awful
 
 I shouldn't be doing this okay I'm going to put the camera right here and um so he basically matched with this girl I I literally have no clue what she looks like I I have no clue she looks like she's going to come over and I'm going to set up the camera like like a like like a like a like a like a uh what's it called like a like a head in camera and then um I'm going to have an air piece I'm going to have the headphones I'm going to have my Hy up I'm going to have my Hy up so much pre had a heades so much pre heades
 
 little a TTS every single donation like with a TTS it's going to like it's so you guys to say and see what to do bro reuploaded and there's a part where he takes off his pants and he starts becoming more aggressive with this girl that he invites over she says that she's ubering home and he begs her to stay ubering why because why you there why you you there she stays for a bit longer they lie down on the couch and you can see that there's some hand activity happening underneath the covers and that's when he decides to get up and
 
 turn on the camera he didn't get banned for this at all even though she didn't consent to being on camera he even admits that the camera was there secretly and I'm going to set up the camera like like a like like a like a like a like a uh what's it called like a like a hidden camera but when I saw this I thought maybe it wasn't real thought it was a setup situation because of the way that he reacted your only way out that's your only way out questions and she doesn't seem to want to answer because she's suspicious of this camera
 
 setup and she says something I feel like and this is what I said okay I'm glad me and Ash on the same page here what I was saying is that when AI voice gu showed us this clip I was more reasonable to this one being scripted slash she knows it's a live stream because she points it out it it had more bearing to it the first one not so much TR to something the I'm scared now you have a camera there I off oh so it's on no appears thing she think goes to change her clothes and okay so after that whole
 
 entire let me cut off right here she think goes to change your clothes okay guys okay hold on video he's now gotten to the mistakes that I have made um now I'm not going to sh Cod it I'm not going to hide anything um basically during this time period um in the past four years of me streaming I did two um secret streams you can call it now what these consisted of is I had I had a girl come over I match on Tinder and I hid the camera um and I wore like two air pieces in my ears and I would have you
 
 know TTS on shocked he's admitting to this I'm actually shocked the last thing I expected was him to admit to this I thought he was just going to say this is fake this is bizarre his lawyer is crying I mean you I can't believe he just admitted to this that is crazy TS on and my chat with donate and basically tell me what to do um and tell me how to act now this and a never this this is not okay in a million years um I'm I was young I was I was stupid you know I let the views dog I think this was like a
 
 year and a half ago oh now I want to know the date now I want to know the date we we'll look we'll look at it I think this was I think this was at most two years ago he's 20 now he said he's 19 here I he was either 18 to 20 years old and just my chat kind of get into my head and tell me to do and I try to blame it on chat no that's a good move I I'm going to use that one to one day and it will it will work for me cuz my chat is are criminals and are and try to make me do things I don't want to do chat
 
 blaming is something else that is a wild strategy so he admits to it but he still blames chat um I'm I was young I was I was stupid you know I let the views and just my chat kind of get into my head and tell me to do and I try to be the good person by listening to them but after reflection I realized that was terrible I don't condone that you can't you can't use the views got to my head excuse for this it's just a different level man it's just a different level at all at the time I didn't realize how
 
 this can you know mess up you know the girl's livelihood it can make them feel uncomfortable it can just you know kind of just ruin their life and this right here was it can make them feel uncomfortable it could ruin their life yeah just not okay um and I deeply regret doing this I've reached out to you know both these girls that have been on my hidden camera streams um I've formally apologized we know we've talked about it and again it was just extremely messed up and it was something not okay
 
 to do at the time you know a bunch of streamers they were doing it you know um and I kind of seen it as like a you know a hidden camera you know prank show or whatever like a reality TV kind of he really he really does see it that way oh my god dude that's what I was joking about before he's like this is our prank show today today we're doing sexual assault just a prank though just a prank though this is my prank show where we where we touch girls without them knowing there's a camera in the room it's just a prank he really saw
 
 it that way oh my Lord you know a hidden camera you know prank show or whatever like a reality TV kind of thing and that was not okay at all I completely like misjudged the situation and I misjudged the whole entire thing um and it was just genuinely genuinely deep down it was messed up I'm not going to lie about that part that was messed up um since then I have changed as a person you know I it it it makes me like think I can't give him any credit for for for get taking accountability on it like you
 
 really can't it's just a whole other level dude it's just a whole other level it doesn't matter you didn't change as a person this was less than two years ago and think like know what's okay and what's not okay but yeah I think it was morally you know messed up um it was something that I should have never done in a million years and it it was dumb it was extremely stupid um I I didn't think or know how bad it was at the time but looking back at it I can you know I can see how you know messed up it was and I
 
 like to apologize to you know after you got banned after you got banned from kick now you suddenly see how bad it was ain't that weird I suddenly reflected and changed as a person really quickly over the course of 24 hours isn't that really strange I've suddenly instantly become better after after I've lost my source of Revenue that's that's interesting what was the point of the first 15 minutes of this apology the first 15 minutes so these are taken out of context he's trying to paint me all sexual stuff just for the second half of
 
 the video be like yes I committed a sex crime yes that's me committing a sex crime on camera yep that's me I did that yes my community and you guys for even you know promoting those type of actions um and thinking that's okay because it's not I like to apologize to kick for even bringing it on the platform and doing something so you know V vital and just cruel on the platform and you know obviously I'd like to apolog this by the way this is Derek grass who I have a video about a long time ago about a year
 
 ago who wanted to fight me and here he is now being a predator to these girls because none of this is platform and you know obviously I'd like to apologize to these girls because none of this is okay these actions are not okay um and I after you know watching what I did and doing something so you know V vital and just cruel on the platform and so vital doing actions that are so vital did I can truly see you know how how messed up how messed up it really was it was it was messed up there's no shirt coating

 some consequence Derek you lost your platform that's it I misread the situation and I just did something stupid um you know forre the situation what does that even mean misread the situation you created the situation there's no misreading it you wrote the situation it's your story reviews and just whatever my brain was thinking at the time but it was truly it it was morally wrong it was morally wrong and messed up and I deeply regret doing that um and it it was just fully messed up so again I like to apologize to kick um for
 
 bringing that like to apologize to you know these girls which I have reach talk them about it and like to apologize to you guys for even condoning that stuff and I'd like to apologize to myself because I'd like to apologize to you guys for even condoning that stuff is that what he said like to apologize to you guys for even condoning that stuff and I don't think he knows what that word means because you wouldn't apologize to your community for allowing it you would say that's up on you guys too I'd like to apologize to myself
 
 because this action genuinely messed up and ruined a good aspect in my life and I don't think you can do that I don't think that's how that works I don't think I don't think you can apologize to yourself Derek pres yes Derek former I'm so Derek pres I'm so sorry that I hidden camera sexually crimedesk former to Derrik presant it's fine I accept your apology thank you Derek former as Derek presant when we go to court this should all be okay cuz I've accepted my own apology your honor I accepted my own apology for real for
 
 real you can't lock me up and I I I think I do need a consequence I think it was terrible so I do fully agree with that it was awful that was the first allegation that was put on my that's only the first one and he admitted to that one all right so I'll say the second one's probably fit name was they do the hashtag free Derek again oh my God this is the thing he used to do when he got banned on on Twitch and Instagram and Tinder it was the whole thing was # freed Derek ah this time it's # put Derek away way now now it's it's #
 
 lockup Derek I don't you can't be rocking that same hashtag anymore man it was messed up it was morally wrong I shouldn't never done that and it was just genuinely stupid it was really dumb um and I you know I feel like a piece of for doing it I think it was so stupid and never in a million years would I repeat the same actions that I have done because it did cause harm and how many years can you just say one more time how many years you wouldn't do this again cuz I I think I missed you the first time cuz it seems like it's only
 
 been less than a few years you're saying how many a million years and never in a million years would I million it was a milli so that was the first allegation and now he gets into the second allegation and that what to play second allegation I just I he's such a idiot on top of everything he's just dumb and that makes me mad when he does bad cuz he's also dumb on top of it there's no point in quote in quoting second allegation it is the second allegation now let me get into the second part of this Reddit post he's
 
 also live streamed himself selling nudes and sex tapes of his two ex-girlfriends one of them apparently has a large following on social media and was under rage at the time once again Derrick is streaming this time this is the second accusation that brought my name so basically um this YouTuber is trying to fra uh claim that I was he's on a loop he is on a loop dude he just said frame instead of claim because he just nonstop just kept saying so basically YouTube trying to frame me in a certain light
 
 which he said 20 times so he just accidentally said it again so basically um this YouTuber is trying to fra uh claim that I was um live streaming me selling explicit photos of my underage ex-girlfriend now this claim is completely false it's completely false and let me explain why so a bunch of these claims come from a bunch of you know Reddit users right and to give you guys the backstory so basically about a month ago um I was in Florida and I had my my editor my fil and my friend and he basically was filming for me editing my
 
 videos and I took him to Jack do Hardy's house right and me and Jack do Hardy got into a altercation and basically I was kicked out of Jack to Hardy's house um and Jack you know told my friend my car man my editor that he would give him you ever have that one friend or cousin or sibling who is trying to tell a story and you're just like get to the meat I don't care about how the early of your week was what happened on Wednesday that's what talk about Wednesday I don't care what happened on Monday or Tuesday
 
 what happened on Wednesday I don't care if it was raining outside I don't care if you had a peal in your Sho get to the point so I was I was left outside I was just complet I was like 45 minutes away from home my phone was at 1% I was get I was fully embarrassed because this kid just took my friend and my live my filmer on stream so um with that being said Jack told my filmer that he was going to hire him which Jack never hired him for for the same exact reason that I'm about to I will be so impressed if
 
 this somehow makes any relevant sense to sending nudes to his moderator tell you so the this this filmer editor was extremely mad at me because he's now not just lost his job from me he's also lost his job from Jack as well so what this filmer has been doing to me is he has been constantly harassing me on Twitter on Discord on YouTube on redit he's made so many fake and in alternate accounts and just talking so bad about my name trying to that addresses the evidence so all of this to bring this
 
 all around he's going to say the person that posted the claim is his vindictive filmer address the claim if anything it might give more Credence to the filmer he actually knows you for this exact claim um and I've blocked all these these people but it's just another account was made another account was made another account was made and she just got to the point where it gets really bad um so this claim has been coming from someone who's been harassing me and trying to take me down he's he's out for blood for me for for no exact
 
 reason because he lost my job or he lost his job and it is genuinely upsetting you stopped that that really was it you're going to stop there are you sure about that you don't have more to say I I I'm actually befuddled yeah if he doesn't address it I swear to you just told us an entire story about the person who posts the claim what about the claim talk about the claim and Derek is streaming this time he's on Snapchat with his friend and he's in a call with his friend now before we watch this clip I
 
 just want to say keep in mind um the chain setup that I was wearing I was wearing what claim I remember I just remember his story the claim is that this is a live stream where he sends his mod a nudes of his ex-girlfriend who then was underage thereby technically sending child he sent he sent Snapchat pictures and his only his eyes only section to to his moderators for money that's the claim and he just told a whole story about how the claim came from a vindictive filmer so he's kind of watching what about his chain talking
 
 about before we watch this clip I just want to say keep in mind um the chain setup that I was wearing I was wearing you know the pearls with the crop before we watch this clip keep in mind uh the absolute fit I was throwing uh you see I got the two chains I kind of had like a button up that wasn't button keep that in mind how dope I look before we get into this um keep in keep in um mind the room the coloring um basically all that yes while while you watch this clip keep that in the back of your mind while I watch
 
 this guessing it's going to be two different streams and he's showing this person compromising pictures of his exgirlfriend and where was on the phone us to pay for them he says I'll give you 10 gifted subs for these pictures and videos and he sends the money I'll give 10 gift you send that to me right now all of that all right 10 gifted come in your way buddy wa there's more oh holy bro thank you person on the call admits that he's going to resell them for $100 that's true think he so again he took a clip
 
 that was extremely out of context and very misleading never in a 100 million years would I 100 million years whoa so it's even more years for this very misleading never in a 100 million years would I ever sell explicit photos of not just people but people who are in my life what is what is the missing context what is the missing context I'm looking at the chains man is it going to come up what about the chains I I'm just what is the missing context in my life and still to this day I've I had I have a
 
 connection with these girls dated these girls for about 2 to three years now um or sorry we've dated for 2 to three years and I would just never do that in a million years this clip is very misleading so basically what I had sent my friend in this very misleading clip was a only fans tape that was supposed to be posted on only fans right so if we go back to about right here and this clip right here I had sub goals right um so basically sub goals is when someone uh Subs it gets like the the Mark or
 
 whatever and like do the challenge so basically at 500 Subs um we would release our only fans tape right and keep in mind this Source trust me bro that's I mean there's not a single receipt he doesn't he doesn't show a single anything but keep going keep yapping girl that would was in the tape but also yeah it's misleading I just what okay keep going she is overage she is fully consensual of it and she's fully aware like you're just telling us this so on the clip it's it's says it's going to be an ex-girlfriend nude and
 
 then he's saying oh no it's this of tape from this other stream a while ago show us show us any proof of that any any message show us the message that's all you got to do all you got to do is show us the message with the guy but you know what when we looked at the AI guys uh YouTube video before this the only thing is that after it and the AI guy was right about this is that when he cuts back to his phone it shows he's on Snapchat on my eyes only section unless he put the off clip in his Snapchat my
 
 eyes only section which I don't think think he did it's probably nuds from his ex so I don't know why and where this guy even tried to pin me selling my underaged ex-girlfriend's explicit photos on something that is just not the case at all and it was a only fans tape that you're just saying that again fully sensual fully aware and fully fully sensual what let tell you what this Creator just did he found a random post on Reddit from dude he didn't address any of it that's actually crazy he's actually so stupid he's actually an
 
 idiot no no evidence that we're talking about an off clip or anything the clip is not taken out of context unless you show the context the clip sounds like you said I'm going to send you my ex's news he said that he said I'm going to show you my ex's nudes but he's like no it's taken out of context I actually showed a whole different girl and an off clip from this other stream no proof someone who's been harassing me for the past week trying to frame me in a very bad hold on so did the chain switch or
 
 did he just say that for no reason chain I'm looking at it okay does it switch is it different I can't even tell okay there's a thing hanging down on that it's the same chain is it not there's no pendant hanging down let's see desk drawers open cow and two stuffed animals yeah it's the exact same I'm looking at this now look at this see this little piece of white cloth on the bed that's going like that compare that to that the exact same that bed has not been slept on now before we watch this clip I just want to say
 
 you're talking about me selling something in my own like personal life you're talking about me selling about you selling child dudee we're talking about you selling something that will land you in jail for years yes allegedly allegedly if everything you said on that stream is true allegedly why in a million years also we saw AI guys uh leaked messages on the Twitter with him and his mods where they literally say it again they say oh he shared news of his ex would I want to have men on the internet see my
 
 ex-girlfriend's body or just something so bizarre of B never in a million years but I I want random people on the internet to see something that's in my personal life someone to see someone that I loved someone that I truly love and and do still care about to this day never in a million years would I do that and that is morally wrong well never in a million years were you going to live stream a girl coming over and then pressuring her for sex but you did that too so as you guys just watched the whole entire video um I was
 
 all right well I'll cover my ass that's all alleged didn't clear up nothing has been cleared up this is all just just yapping you're on a permission to Yap for 30 minutes I think this should do us this should do us good was basically claimed sorry accused of two things one was you know the hidden camera prank streams and I'm not going to Sure called that that was extremely messed up that was very that was very viral he admits to it well he admits to the first thing the the alleged sending of his ex is nude so that's alleged
 
 supposedly that's a that's alleged and something just terribly gross to do um I I'm not going I was young and I didn't that time but that's not an excuse um I have been growing that as a I've been growing as a person ever since then and I think that is just fully and truly messed up um but the second Claim about me selling explicit photos of my ex-girlfriend is just completely false and completely untrue and just if in and and Frames me looking like a terrible person and it sucks that as of right now
 
 I don't have you know my Ki platform form to you know go over this and and and speak my voice and tell you guys what's really going on because I was just framed and now I have no voice you're doing such a bang up job of it here don't worry I'll spread the word Derek don't worry I'll spread the word for you I will push this message out on my YouTube channel to get eyes on this uh vantastic apology I will I will get all the eyes on this apology that must be heard with a lot of proof a lot of evidence to clear your good name cuz I
 
 stand for Derek free Derek #f freed Derek um I plan on making this video you know dropping it and then you know maybe I'm drop some YouTube videos like some Vlog type of videos um let's maybe not self-promote at the end of your apology video for essay man maybe maybe the wrong time not everything put out there about me is true none a lot of it is not true um and yeah so but the main thing that's really bad is true and you're trying to take accountability right so let take accountability dog none a lot
 
 of it is not true um and yeah so I just wanted to clear it up I just want to make this video I miss you guys um I love you and you know I hope to see you guys soon I'll be I'll be on YouTube for quite some time but um you know I hope to get on banned on Kick um and I just want to say I love you guys and no way it just ends like that no way it just ends it just ends in # free dere that is that is crazy and I love you guys free Derek that might have been one of the worst apology videos I've ever seen just
 
A191	https://youtu.be/3yV1eppu7E8?si=QvKdLGrp6A1bO53E	now almost everybody has a spot or two on their skin they would like to remove whether that be a mole a skin tag the occasional wart freckle even sometimes that tattoo he got way back when and there are all sorts of at-home diy ways to address a lot of those issues including a plasma pin now these types of devices are pretty new on the market and pretty new in the home but do they really work can they remove these skin issues safely and more importantly do they hurt well i tested one out on myself and i'm going to give you all the  details of how that turned out in today's video [Music] well hey everybody welcome back to the channel if you're new and don't know who i am i'm chris i'm a skin care expert been doing this for 34 years and i'm here to help you find skincare that will work for you not empty your wallet and not do you more harm than good so if that's the kind of content that you've been looking for here on youtube please be sure and subscribe hit that little notification bell so that you know when my new videos come out every week now  the holidays are officially upon us which means we are all looking for gifts to give other people and ourselves which i get that i actually get myself stuff when i go christmas shopping i know i'm selfish but anyway some of the hottest items out there this year are skin care devices and a lot of these devices are able to perform treatments in the home that used to be relegated to a dermatologist office or an esthetician and a spa and one of the most popular ones is this little guy right here a plasma pin that supposedly can remove  moles warts skin tags cherry angiomas and even small tattoos wow that's quite the order and if it works quite the savings of having to go to the dermatologist and have a procedure done yeah costs money to do that these devices usually range from about 40 dollars which this device is in that range all the way up to 200 bucks for the dermavel version now the difference in these pins is basically the strength settings and the needles that they supply to use on the various skin issues and the quality  design and manufacturing device also can play a role in the price however they do exactly the same thing now a lot of people think that what this is is a hot needle that's going to burn or cauterize the mold the wart the skin tag or what have you and actually these don't work that way the needle doesn't actually get hot wear the name plasma pen comes from is that this little tip produces an arc of electricity or an electrical arc that you can actually see makes little bitty sparks as it approaches the skin has a lot to do with  ions and electricity and negative and positive charges but basically it just vaporizes the outer skin cells of whatever spot you're trying to treat now i chose three specific things i wanted to test this on bother some skin tags that i get because i work out i get them right here between my chest and my arm not really the armpit but in that area because of my workouts over the years and also i wanted to test it out on a cherry angioma and an age spot that i've been trying for forever to completely  fade on my hand with topical acids since these devices say they can help with that let's take a look at the before and after pictures of the treatment so first i did this on an age spot on my left hand that has been there for about 10 years i've had a lot of success fading this age spot with topical acids worked very well for me although it's never quite gone all the way away so the idea that i could treat it once with this type of device and actually get rid of it and i wouldn't have to treat it with  anything else that's very appealing to me as you can see the age spot is quite dark after i treated it with the plasma pin again the way these pins work is they vaporize that outer layer of skin cells creating kind of scab there was no bleeding there wasn't really much pain although there was a sensation kind of a tingling sensation as i use the device and you do smell like burnt skin or burnt hair that's kind of what it smells like now on this particular pen there are three strength settings and they recommend that you use  as high a setting as you can tolerate now i didn't have a lot of pain using this on any of these spots there was a tingling sensation kind of like a quick pin prick of a feeling but not any real pain nothing that would turn me away from doing it i chose the second level setting to use on this particular device because i felt like that would be enough of a charge to do what i wanted to do without causing me too much distress i'm kind of a big when it comes to any kind of pain like needles or burning or  any of that sort of stuff so i was happy that this was not painful so now you can see two weeks later after the scab has had time to heal and come off the difference on my hand between the spot when i treated it and the spot after i treated it and it's almost completely gone so i was very happy with it now i'm going to demonstrate in this video treating the spot one more time just to see if i can get rid of those last dark melanin full skin cells and really make this completely invisible on my skin  again the idea of it not coming back and me having to worry with it or treat it again is very exciting to me as i said i also treated some skin tags on the side of my chest between my arm near the armpit area skin tags usually are formed from some sort of friction on our skin from clothing the first one i ever got was on my back where my belt touched the back of my skin i had to have that removed professionally it was painful didn't like it so i did treat the skin tag as you can see in this picture and i  also treated a small cherry angioma at the same time again same sensation kind of a tingling sensation use the level two strength to do this kind of had a smell of burning hair both of those spots vaporized down very quickly and created a tiny non-painful scab two weeks later when the spots completely healed and those tiny little scabs are gone you can see the difference now i will tell you i was excited about removing skin tax with this because skin tags are benign they're usually not going to be a problem  some people cut them off some people use a razor blade you go to the dermatologist they're going to cauterize them or freeze them off sometimes they just cut them off so i'm very pleased with the effects of this device on skin tags now you may have noticed that i left out talking about moles or treating moles and there's a very good reason for that most moles people have are going to be eligibly treated with a device like this and they would be treated the same way in a professional office the problem is  i don't know what your moles look like you know what your moles look like i don't know if they're new i don't know if they're irregular i don't know if they're growing i don't know anything about that so i must tell you you really do need to have any mole that you're going to have removed checked by your doctor or a dermatologist before you do anything to it most moles are going to be okay raised moles that you've had your whole life that haven't changed in color or structure or any of that are probably  99.9 going to be eligible but if you're looking at a mole that's growing it's irregular it doesn't match the color of your other moles or it's changing in any way please do not use a device on that and go get it checked skin cancer is not worth the risk so just keep that in mind now when it comes to using these type of devices it's very important that you read and understand the instructions that you understand how to use them how to sterilize the tip how to apply the tip to the skin and how to know it's  working or not working how to adjust the strength levels for your comfort level which tip you need to be using in the pen because usually they come with multiple sizes and styles of tips for different skin issues this tip is probably going to be the most common to use to treat a mole a wart or a skin tag if you're going to be treating freckles cherry angiomas or trying to remove a small tattoo you're probably going to use one of the needle like tips to do that these are much smaller tips than this and are able to  move across the skin much more easily and much more thoroughly get the exact spot you're looking to treat so before i demonstrate treating my age spot again on camera i do want to point out that i didn't choose any particular pin over another they all do basically the same thing they just more expensive they have more choices more options more strength settings this particular one it's a perfectly good pen that's wrong with it about 40 bucks three treatment strengths and the optional needles that you would need to  treat any particular type of issue the first thing that's very important to do is to obviously sterilize the tip and also the spot that you're going to treat so you just want to wipe that down and give that just a few minutes for the alcohol to evaporate and go away so it should be completely dry before you apply the plasma pin to the spot so i'm going to turn this one on and then i'm going to select the level two you see by the red lights on two three is the strongest i don't find that necessary so  two is good for me but for some of you three might be better and then in order to get the pin to actually work you have to hold this out button which turns on the current in the tip of the pin all right so it's been long enough for me to do this so i'm going to just you'll see little sparks it doesn't actually burn it just feels kind of like a needle prick so i'm gonna just get it one more round i'm just lightly holding the needle over it there's tiny little arcs that come out and now you can see the spot is  dark again so it's actually vaporized that skin that was

M194	https://youtu.be/W6aYv1uBW9U?si=YjJDqoEgdFaCg1pt	[Music] yeah he [Music] hey y'all welcome back to another Vlog hi you want to say hi hi everybody hi guys um so obviously I've been gone for a while and we're definitely going to touch on that before uh we start the Vlog and everything but before we even get into that I definitely want to say hi I hope everyone is doing well and I want to start with thanking you all for praying for Java by now I think most of you if not all of you have heard the news about him he did make it by the grace of God he is home um but he is in
 
 isolation right now so he can't like come out and play with us because he is still recovering uh at this point he has no symptoms which is literally a move of God like he ended up with an upper respiratory infection after the parva virus um as a result of the parva virus I should say um but he has no upper respiratory symptoms at this moment he hasn't since Friday morning um so he is well on his way up and out and I thank God for delivering him and um just taking all the sickness from his body and just allowing him to live to see
 
 another day like I thank God every day for that I am in awe of everything God did in this situation so I am very thankful and thank y'all for praying so much for my little boy it always amazes me how like I don't want to cry but it always amazes me how Community can just come to your a like every time I need something y'all are literally there for me like when I was going through what I went through in July y'all were right there for me um with this Java situation y'all are right there for me like having
 
 a community of Prayer Warriors is unparallel to have a community of people that have your back through prayer it literally means the world to me you have no clue like all of us talking to God in unison and sending up our prayers to him and asking him to heal Java's body I'm eternally grateful for y'all to y'all um it it like it literally I'm still shocked by it every time I ask y'all are right there for me so from the bottom of my heart thank you and I love you guys so much like seriously I love you guys
 
 Juno loves you too um but by now you all know that he did have Paro so unfortunately I only had him for about 4 days before he had to be hospitalized U so he came home November 11th excuse me he came home November 11th everything seemed normal um uh so he had a vet appointment the Tuesday after that which was the 14th U and at that vet appointment the vet was a little shocked and she had said that he didn't look like he had ever seen a vet because the condition he was in like to me he appeared normally
 
 obviously but I'm not a dog expert I'm not a dog doctor I'm not an animal doctor so um like the things that she noticed I obviously didn't notice hence why I took him to the vet to get checked out um he had a reducible still has a reducible umbilical hernia which which I know isn't all that uncommon in dogs but it seems like something that I should have known about from the breeder from the jump he also had an extra Claw on his hand if you know anything about dogs and breeders they usually typically
 
 declaw a dog before giving it to you it's in like an extra vestigial structure right here on the wrist like an extra finger if you will that has nail attached to it um so most breeders remove those um so I had no clue about those things and I found out about them like at the vet visit so immediately after that I informed the breeder like hey he has an umbilical hernia and an extra claw like I believe that these are things that I should have known about um before acquiring Java unfortunately he immediately dismissed me and told me to
 
 leave them alone um very shocked at that and he told me that if it were a big deal that he would have told me about it now I'm not going to leave my dog with an umbilical hernia um so I said that I wasn't going to leave it alone and I actually requested $200 back from this breeder um$ 150 because that is the add-on to the neuter surgery to get the umbilical hernia fixed they do it at the time of neuter and then 50 to declaw him properly they also will do that at the time of neuter um so that's an extra
 
 $200 that I would have spent on something that I I shouldn't um so uh immediately I got to run around he wasn't really willing to give the 200 back and then the next day Java stopped eating and he started to get really sick um during this time I I would say that the breeder was helpful uh he hopped on a FaceTime call with me like after Jama started Jama Java started to vomit he assured me that it wasn't parvo of course he did um dog was vomiting profusely um all of Thursday morning so I took him to the vet immediately the
 
 same that we went to on Tuesday uh at this time he did not have diarrhea they did not run a parvo test because they had no reason to he was not symptomatic for parvo all he was doing was vomiting he wasn't like noticeably lethargic he was just vomiting um which is obviously weird and I thought it was a red flag so I obviously took him in cuz vomiting in a 10 week old puppy is not normal um so at this time they just gave him an anti nausea and that was pretty much all they did for him they kept him for some hours
 
 they said that he was not vomiting because he had that anti nausea injection so I was able to go pick him up but something still in my spirit just didn't feel right y'all um so I kept an eye on him and that night he started to have diarrhea profusely continued to vomit even on the anonia and so I knew that something was very very very wrong like I said I hopped on a FaceTime call with the breeder um he let me know that it wasn't parvo was just going out of his way to assure me that it wasn't parvo almost was a when I asked if it
 
 was parvo um so I I slept on it I gave him fluids I I just I I just tried to make sure he was okay cuz they were trying to like give me advice on what to do it obviously I'm taking the advice from them uh the next morning he was not any better so I decided to rush him to the ER um and on intake they did confirm that it was par virus unfortunately um and when I told the breeder he denied that it was parvo he said that it was a false test unfortunately took no accountability it like the whole situation I'm in even
 
 still now it's just it's mind-blowing um so Java had to be hospitalized for 5 days obviously you can imagine the stress I was under those whole five days going back and forth with a breeder not taking accountability ups and downs of Java's Health like one day he seemed okay the next day his fever was 106 he had extremely low white blood cell count for two days in a row it honestly y'all it just didn't look good um even they were telling me like you know it's not it's not looking good um and that the only thing that they
 
 could do for him is just continually pump fluids into him um by this point uh he had to be hospitalized like for an extra two days so the first time I paid around 3,000 around sorry 2,200 for a deposit for two days but the total cost is like 3,000 for the two days um so I obviously paid it up front because at that point I'm willing to pay anything to keep the dog alive um cuz I knew that he had a chance now it may have been slim cuz if you don't know Paro virus fatality rate is around 80% um but since he was being treated
 
 those odds can go lower and the fatality rate can start to decrease with treatment so I thought you know I'm going to give him my Fighting Chance I'm not just going to take him home and watch him die and I have the means to do so so I'm going to I'm going to pay the 2250 that it costs for a deposit for two days y'all um so after that I got in my car I started ranting because I was just so angry y'all I was so angry I was so angry like how can you you tell someone it's parvo and they immediately dismiss
 
 you and tell you that it's a false test like that to me it blew me out of the water like it blew my mind um and then no accountability at all and I like I don't know y'all I was just angry I was angry I was angry I was angry and back and forth with him over those five days was just too much to bear honestly because on one hand I had a sick dog who may not have made it who was looking like he wouldn't make it and then on the other hand I have an irresponsible unaccountable breeder and it's just like
 
 two battles at once so after his initial 2-day hospitalization he was not getting better y'all so they had let me know that they were opting to keep him there and that it would be another $3,000 so at this point I you know I had to coach myself I'm like you have to take a step back and really look at what you're dealing with here now I do know that God Is A Healer and that he can do anything but at this point I wanted to just analyze the situation for what it was because um the Breeders were not willing
 
 to reimburse me I was speaking about reimbursement they were giving me the run around so much um I had even you know typed up a long message stating what I paid for and what I'm asking for I was not asking for the price of the dog I was not asking for all the toys that I had to throw away because they were contaminated I was not asking for emotional distress money I was simply asking for a refund of the deposit that I gave to have Java in the hospital um it was clear that they were giving me a run around that they did not want to
 
 give me my money which was shocking to me um but at this point they let me know that he needed to be hospitalized for an additional two days so I was I just had to coach myself into taking a step back family members too like hey you need to look at the situation for what it actually is if they're saying that he might not make it you need to take a step back and reeval reevaluate the situation financially and do what's most financially responsible um instead of just keep pouring thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars into
 
 unfortunately a puppy whose odds didn't look good so at this point I opted to bring him home to care for him as much as I could obviously I wasn't willing to give up on him but I wasn't willing to just keep pouring money into a situation that did not look good y'all um so at this point I reached out to the Breeders again like hey are you willing to pay for this if not he will have to come home also I want to mention like one of the reasons why I was taking that financial responsibility gauge is
 
 because or scope I guess you could say is because um something happened to us that was extremely unfortunate and like that shouldn't have fallen on me should have fallen on the reader I believe that there should have been a accountability immediately responsibility immediately and reimbursement immediately um but if this were on me it would be different like if Juno got sick of course I would pay my last dollar to save his life right but to be given a sick puppy and then be expected to pay $6,000 on top of
 
 the 2.5 you already paid for the dog and all the V business up until then it's just like wow I'm kind of being screwed over like honestly I'm I'm just being screwed over and since nobody's able to take accountability or responsibility for this it it falls on me nobody wants a sick dog you sign up and you buy a healthy dog nobody wants it now things are unforeseen and understand that things happen and that goes to say that like if he had taken accountability we wouldn't be in this situation I wouldn't
 
 be as upset I'm only angry because there is no accountability there is no responsibility only the only thing that there is is blame and it's shifting to me when I should not be blamed for the situation especially as a business owner like you need to run a business properly and treat your customers properly but beond all that I have to take a step back and reevaluate the situation financially and say hey is this the best decision for me because I was given a dog 5 days ago and I I've just been pouring so much money into it um a dog
 
 that just came into my house like I and I know people can understand that like imagine getting a sick puppy you don't even get to barely bond with it but you're just pouring pouring pouring pouring pouring money thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars when I have a other things to take care of obviously financially um so I just wanted to be responsible so I opted to bring him home that night and you know his odds weren't looking great but I just I I couldn't keep pouring thousands and thousands into the
 
 situation so I reach out to the breeder again to see if they were willing to pay for it astonishingly they said that they were um still no talk about reimbursement for his first vet visit and I don't understand how you would be willing to pay for the second vet visit but not the first vet visit that got him to the second visit like if I hadn't paid for that first hospital State he wouldn't be alive so it was a little mind-boggling to me that you were willing to pay for the second visit um so I got to the doctor's office at this
 
 point they called me on the phone said they were willing to um pay for it and they talked to the doctor and they were trying to talk to her and tell her that he didn't have parvo that it could be all these other things trying to basically insult her intelligence and her medical professional opinion not even opinion is fact because they ran tests on him and confirmed it positive for Paro uh the greed and the know-it-all spirits of these people was overwhelming even the doctor was shocked she was shook at the things that they
 
 were saying to her it was overwhelmingly disgusting and like I said they were insulting her intelligence over and over and over again telling her that oh it could be this it's probably not parvo did you do this did you do that as if she doesn't know what she's doing but beyond that uh she she just kind of let them know like Hey we're not here to debate if it's par or not we're we're like we're trying to see if you're going to pay for it cuz Alexis is in a hard situation she was giving a sick puppy
 
 that night they said they would pay for it that night they did not pay for it the next morning I believe a random amount was posted to Java's account in the amount of $1,300 like I said the deposit was around $2,200 where they got 13 from 22 I don't know I do believe that they were trying to just keep Java alive for liability reasons um but they did post that $1,300 which I'm still grateful for but the vet actually let me know that they if they did not give the money and this how I know I was dealing
 
 with God in this situation the vet she sat me down and she said hey if they don't pay it we're going to take care of it all my mouth dropped to the ground and I immediately started to just like cry because there's like God is just like so faithful in that situation it's like he saw me running out of options um with Java and he literally sent an angel on my behalf on Java's behalf and she said hey we'll pay for it if they don't come up with the money and I was like are you sure are you sure are you sure she said
 
 absolutely we'll take care of it we're going to keep him alive he's too cute to die and that's what I knew without a shadow of a doubt that Java was going to live because God just moved through this woman and made a way from me so there's no way he's going to die like there's no way that he's going to die it is unheard of for a vet to cover vet bills I've never heard of that that's how I know I was dealing with God and like I said beyond that point I knew without a shadow of a doubt that Java was going to
 
 make it so I handed the rest over to God I was done going back and forth with the Breeders I was done with it all you guys I was done couldn't do anymore and since God came down and said hey I got your back here's your option you don't have to fight with those people anymore I stopped I stopped all communication with them and that was like the best thing ever because I was relieved you know um and I gave it all to God and then the next morning they called me and said that his fever had broken that his white
 
 bu cellc count was back to normal and that he could come home so yeah after 5 days hospitalized and not looking so good they called me after I gave it to God and they told me he can come and God healed his body bottom back from sickness and death y'all like God has his name presence all over this situation from start to finish Java is meant to be here he has purpose in my life he literally has purpose you guys um he's a miracle he's a walking Miracle anytime I need a reminder of how good and faithful God is I can look at Java
 
 it's literally incredible and I'm so grateful to God that he's living um I don't know it warms my heart to see God work a miracle like that on my behalf like the only thing I can ask for now is the healthy dog um so like I said I've stopped communicating with the breeder they even were were being so nasty and rude to me after me asking for my money like 50,000 times you guys they're like I don't know why you keep asking we said we will help with some I'm like some isn't good enough some isn't going to
 
 cut it I didn't somewh give from parvo um so some vet bills wouldn't cover it um but beyond that y'all I don't know I was treated so nasty so mean and so disrespectful um the behaviors and attitudes were absolutely rancid and I like I couldn't believe the situation that I was in like I said taking accountability would have made up for the situation 100 fold I wouldn't even have been that angry that he had parvo if they had taken accountability it's just the fact that no accountability was taken
 
 um so that's what angered me the most and like I said there there's just so many like days that I was going back and forth with them so many things that were said to me that were absolutely unacceptable I was told that he didn't have par that the test was false I was told to just stop I was told that this that I wasn't sent a sick puppy so I need to stop saying that on social media like it was astounding and since then I've been blocked on everything um so so I'm just here to tell our testimony I'm not here to even
 
 spread negativity like I said I'm just here to tell our testimony and how good God has been to us and that's that's pretty much it um but I am going to leave a review and I'm going to handle it you guys don't worry but beyond that I've taken my hands out of it I'm not going to fight evil with evil I'm going to let God handle it because like I said God has his name written all over this from start to finish so it will be completely remissed of me to not think that God's not going to handle that breeder on the back end I know he's
 
 going to handle it because he bought he delivered Java from Death he bought him out from sickness and death so if he did that he's surely going to handle those breeders so like I said I've taken my hands out of it and I've given it to God um and I'm not going to fight evil with evil I'm not going to fight fire with fire I'm not going to stoop as low as they have um I'm going to keep it cute and I'm going to do what I need to do and I'm going to let God do what he needs to do um and that's pretty much it
 
 but y'all I have a healthy puppy I've not been reimbursed my vet bills they also told me something about needing to sign some documentation I think they were trying to like hush me like shut me up um and prevent me from telling the story on social media because I had made a post in ask for prayers for Java like one day he was in the hospital and in the comments everybody was like oh my gosh the breeder needs to take accountability this is on the breeder because like obviously if you've been given a puppy and 5 days later they're
 
 in the hospital for par virus given the incubation period of the virus which is 5 to 7 Days the virus would have had to come um out of your care out of my care and in the care of the Breeders unfortunately um so they had like they were like you're you're taking stuff to social media I'm like I'm not taking anything to social media all I asked for was prior to my dog you know um but it's not up to me what people say in the comments like it's not up to me but obviously we can all conclude that the you know
 
 what's What's Happening Here uh and then the way they act has also just further concluded what is happening here and then the fact that I've been blocked has further concluded what has happened here um but like I said there's there's a lot of caveats there's a lot of facts and just like little things that happen that I am leaving out of this for time's sake even um but even the sake of like I don't need to fight anymore I got my dog back he's healthy um but you guys like if you've been following like if youve
 
 been following Juno Java on their stories and Tik Tock and things you know the nasty things that were said to me um from this breeder but like I said I can't fight evil with evil it's just not in me U and I want to stay blessed so that's not something I'm willing to do but at the end of the day I got my puppy back and he's healthy so that's all I can ask for and yeah I've been blessed blessed to be able to take care of him blessed in a situation where I didn't know if I was willing to pour a thousand
 
 more dollars in him and God said I got it and the vet said they will handle it I've been blessed at every turn and I got my puppy back so I'm eternally grateful for that and we can all start to move forward with our healthy puppy he is like I said in isolation and he's coming out on Tuesday today is currently Sunday and I'm very happy for him and like I said he's no longer symptomatic he is shining he is barking he is playing he's eating he's drinking he's sleeping he's doing doing everything he's just doing everything correctly and
 
 that's all I could ask for at this point um especially him coming so close to death so I know God has his name written all over this but I'm going to put this situation to rest for now and I'm going to move on with my healthy dog so yeah welcome back to another Vlog and I hope everyone had an amazing week I was absent last week so I miss you guys tremendously uh I haven't really been doing anything y'all I've been buckled down I haven't driven my car since Tuesday since the Tuesday Java came home
 
 um haven't been doing anything I've been taking care of the sick dog I haven't really been able to leave very much I haven't gone anywhere cuz I haven't needed to but I haven't been able to leave very much because he was on Round the Clock medicine today is actually his last day of all his medicines except for his antibiotic like I said he ended up with an upper respiratory infection so we are trying to continue to treat that until the antibiotics are gone but he's he's he's completely normal like he's completely normal but
 
 I'm just taking every extra precaution uh to prevent Juno from being sick cuz I don't want to have too sick dogs on my hands um but yeah today is the first day I'm actually leaving the house like I said I had to throw a lot of stuff away on behalf of the dogs so they need new toys new beds new blankets new everything cuz I'm not willing to keep parva virus in here if you all don't know the only thing that kills it is bleach and um if you don't kill it with bleach it can live on surfaces for months uh so I'm going to toss
 
 everything that is cloth every blanket every bed I'm going to bleach some of the toys that can be bleached other than that I'm just going to buy new ones and and I'm going continue to stay blessed y'all like I know I was put in an unfortunate situation and I have to just keep spending money here and there and just taking care of what needs to be taken care of but I'm willing to do it um for the sake of the dogs so yeah we're going to go to HomeGoods to get them some new toys I need to run a Target to get a few things I need to go
 
 to the grocery store to get a few things I'm also going to cook some soup when I get back and then I need to um I think that's it we might do like a little wind down with me skincare routine tonight since I have yet to do that plus this Vlog I don't even know how long it's going to be so I'm trying to like lengthen it a little bit so we can do that tonight we can cook I might do my nails and yeah that's pretty much it and again thank you guys for praying keeping me uplifted during this hard time I am back
 
 I am so tired you can probably tell I'm still stressed um but I've given the situation to God and the one thing I wanted out of the situation was a healthy dog and I have that now so I eternally grateful so yeah let's go ahead and get the ball rolling with to day there's literally nothing else to catch y'all up on I've been taking care of the sick puppy all week um oh I ordered some things for Black Friday or on Black Friday since I wasn't able to go to the mall oh also for Thanksgiving guys I did not get to
 
 go home I know some people know that I was looking forward to it so much um I can see my family and just traveling there but Java cannot make it home so I had to stay here and just take care of him um so I stay here and I cook me a little bit of food and I I ate that and Juno watch me eat it and I watched the movie and that was pretty much it it wasn't all that sad but I wish I could have gone home but I still will um what else I ordered a couple things from Zara glossier I got another aritzia Super
 
 puff oh my ritar order just got delivered I got another ARA super puff cuz I wanted a short one and then what else did I get I got some things from glossy I already said oh I got some jeans from Apple be as it comes in I'll unbox it for you all but that's the only thing I actually have to catch y'all up on like as it relates to like my life like the other stuff in life but yeah I'm about to show you my outfit and I guess we can start running errands all right y'all this is my outfit for the day this set is from Princess Polly I'm
 
 going to post a haul soon with a code for you all to get some discount off of uh anything you want from Princess poly so definitely check my Tik Tok for that but I'm wearing a piece a little bit early I have not posted the haul yet and um coach pills happy and then my plastic slippers I'm also going to throw on my ARA super because it is very cold outside so I cannot go without a coat I was going to try to keep it cute but honestly I mean honestly I'm I'm going try to keep it warm um so yeah and then
 
 when I get back I'm going to show you guys Java because right now he is sleeping and I'm not trying to wake him up I'm just trying to get out of the house so I can get back here within like a 4H hour time span because um that's as long as I'm willing to leave them created at this time for so I'm trying to just hurry up and get out of here so I can just do something for myself and just focus on myself today as you all know I've been caring for him around the clock and I haven't been leaving leing
 
 the house or anything also did my makeup on live I was able to say hi to everybody after a long time of not being able to say hi to everybody uh or just not feeling up to it rather earrings are TJ Maxx and then I'm wearing my normal jewelry my Kendra Scott necklace and then the a necklace is from Nordstrom and a lot of people still ask me so the glasses are from morie Parker and I slick my hair back into a bun or up into a bun my hair has been in a bun for like weeks I think at this point I've not
 
 washed it in a long time U so I need to figure out something to do with my hair but it looks okay for right now um but yeah so let's just go ahead and put my coat on then let's get out of here it's raining a little bit but y'all I am geek to just be out of my house and like to not have a sick dog anymore I know that's like the topic of discussion for the last I don't even know how long um I'm just happy to be able to move on like and just live our normal lives um and just start to train Java and stuff
 
 just cuz he deserves none of this he has been in isolation he's been through the ringer he's been fighting parvo he's he's just he doesn't deserve any of it he's innocent in all of it um so I'm glad to just be able to move on but I'm also glad to just be able to spend some time by myself because child I haven't been out of my house in so long even if it is to run errands for the dogs um I'm happy to do that but I want to make some soup so bad tonight y'all I want to make some chicken and rice soup cuz I've been
 
 seeing it like on Tik Tok a lot and I used to eat chicken and rice soup all the time when I was little girl I was craving some super so bad last night I was considering making it yesterday but I was like I'll just wait till today so after we we finish the errands I do need to stop by wagies or Wagman's and grab a couple of ingredients cuz this has to be like a dairyfree chicken and rice cuz I know a lot of people add like cream of chicken but I can't have cream of chicken U so I need to think of an alternative real
 
 quick cuz I don't want it to be like super soupy I want it to have that thicker consistency like chicken and rice soup does but I'm so excited we get to pick out some new toys for the puppies all right just made it to HomeGoods I forgot this HomeGoods actually also has a Marshalls and the last time I was at this HomeGoods X Marshalls girl I found me some good stuff so I'm going to go over to the Marshall side and treat my little my my little self but let's go in here and see what um all we can find I'm pretty sure
 
 they have some stuff for the dogs it won't be hard to find them [Music] anything [Music] found this throw blanket look at that um the beds are already here so let's go see what they have I would give them a bed to share but I don't know if they're there yet let's see they have a lot of beds oh wait hold on this one down here is like really cute and it looks like it matches the couch this one's cute not this one this one cute kind of big though like this would have to be for both dogs but we're going to get it anyways this one's
 
 smaller but I don't like the gray i a t up underneath that one um I kind of need another sleeper for the boys yo this one is too cute look at this the way I just threw everything on the ground this is so cute oh my gosh I kind of want this it's just so big if this was smaller it would be too cute how much is this oh that's $4 we going to put in the back we didn't see it this one is so cute it matches that couch pillow by Rachel Zoe but it's just ginormous is there's no way I'm bringing that into the house or should I cuz like
 
 where can to go like y'all this is huge this for a freaking golden retriever I'm bling too much about get that but it's just too cute I wish they had that smaller like these are for the great names not no Ministry sser these are too cute I am sick right now I wish they had that one and a smaller size let me look through here to make sure I'm going to end up going with two of these instead of anything else just cuz like that's ugly I don't really like the the beds that they have um these are cool like
 
 this can go in the the CR for Java and then this one can go my bedroom FL for Juno so we'll get two of those and also got these these treets because Java's streets also have to go to garbage can I've been feeding him those in isolation and I just don't want to contaminate anything further so those streets will have to go in the garbage can um but let's go look at the toys real quick all right I'm very strategic in what I normally buy because um this only $4.99 W I hate when they tear stuff up too
 
 much so this is cute for him um what else do they have now I'm on the Marshall side of things I love Marshall for little things like this like those lofas are too good um I don't think I'm going to get anything over there but I'm going cut through here see what else they got my camera is on his last leg so I might have to use my phone but um see what else I think I want need of this it no it was like a little sprinkle a little drizzle number all right I'm done in HomeGoods I actually got quite a bit of
 
 stuff for them um it really wasn't that crazy it came to 115 and I got a lot of stuff so that's like some much better than like petmart and Petco you get a toy there it'd be like $1999 for one toy if you got as many toys as I did I probably would have spent like $300 in petmart Petco but most of their toys were three4 $5 U the beds were like 156 $17 uh the blankets were like $7 so I always advocate for stopping at HomeGoods if you want to get some stuff for your pets cuz the pric is y'all too good um so I was going to go to Target
 
 next but I'm like Target what I needed from Target only thing I needed was paper towel and some scent boosters and I'm like I can save that because now it's raining so I kind of just want to go to Trader Joe's buff City soap because they have this new um body mist and they have it in narcissist plus I need some more scent boosters and laundry detergent um so I can go over there cuz that's I think yeah that's over there by Trader Joe's so I can do that and then I can just hit Wegman's or maybe I don't have
 
 to go to WG maybe I can get all the soup stuff at Trader Joe's and I can go on home and start cooking cuz the rain got me like oo oh I want to go home U I was thinking about Ulta at the same time but I'm like again I want to go home um so let me decide I think I'm going head to Trader Jo's and buff City soap right now and then make my way to um home if if after that I want to go to Target we'll we'll make one more stop but let's go down to treer Jo's real quick get what we need or buff City so I
 
 don't know which one first they're pretty much next next to each other almost um so let's go down there get what we need and then we'll head on oh that's my mom that's my mom hi hi Lexi the buff City soap I got a good little spot um there's also an ala like right behind me so I might run in there cuz I heard that e.l. has some um new lip liners to go with the lip oils I don't know so um I'm trying to hurry up though cuz I'll be feeling guilty when I leave Java at home Jun know I don't really care like he's a master at
 
 staying alone but um I'm trying to get home to drive so I'm running here maybe Ulta oh my God norer Ulta right there but then after that I'm going to go to St Jo's and go home that never get all like the award stairs that I get as I'm Vlogging walking past people I love it so much [Music] I'm so happy right now they have candles and narcissist now there of course also there's 40% off all the full size body care I do kind of need another body butter so I might grab one of those other than that um I'm not going to get
 
 anything else but I'm having to make my um aloe and clover SC boosters in the back right now it's really [Music] cool all right back secured uh I got the candle the sit boosters and the body mist I'm eager to try that out I don't suspect it'll last long cuz typically body Mists don't that's why I don't like them um but to layer that with a body butter I feel like a win-win a win-win um so now I'm about to run a TR Jo's get a couple things and then head home trying to figure out if I want to oh my
 
 gosh I kind of want some sushi rolls real quickly sorry kind want some sushi rolls but I kind of also just want to go home right now so I'm not going to stop at hotel I don't need anything all right y'all I made it back inside just need to show you or want to show you Java's setup here so what I ended up doing was getting the the gate um and just s it up like this in the doorway so Juno can't get in or like touch noses with Java he's eating right now he was very hungry so as soon as I got here I fed him he eats three times a
 
 day he eats at around 8:00 a.m. around 3 p.m. and again around 700 he also drank some water he uh also got a new Fresh a new Fresh patch today um so hi forget what I'm saying let's look at you y'all this dog is doing so well he is doing so well Jun over in the bags J know get out the bags eat eat jav oh okay you want to come out can't come out y'all he's sassy he is Sassy he want to play with you know they've been doing this for days y'all they want to play so bad um his isolation is up Tuesday but I'm probably
 
 going to remove him from here tomorrow I'm going to call the vet and see what they say uh because like I said he hasn't shown respiratory symptom and symptoms and days so I feel like he's fine to come out and again we're not worried about the par for Juno he's fully vaccinated it is is extremely rare for a fully vaccinated adult dog to get parvo like extremely rare the V let me know that they've never seen it before um so Juno's protected against the parvo but again his upper respiratory infection symptoms are gone so I'm not
 
 worried about Juno like at all um so I'm going to probably end his isolation tomorrow if not Tuesday but it was a struggle getting all this stuff upstairs I did use a cart Java got a new Fresh patch he actually just used it so I just uh put the new one on the balcony that's also been another struggle as far as like resources go because as far as like sanitation goes any poop is going to like largely have the P virus in it there's something on the camera there uh any poop is going to largely have the par virus shedded in it
 
 so any poop I want outside I do not want it inside because uh to kill par virus it's already really hard and it lives on surfaces for so long so um I've been taking them to the patio to use the bathroom as a whole just also to give them some fresh air like to be sold a sick puppy is the most inconvenient thing ever because I'm wasting resources trying to stay clean and sanitary unfortunately um but we got to do what we got to do so we just got another fresh cash deliver so I just put that out there replace old one and I also got
 
 my Zara delivery so let's just start with bu soap of course they had the narcissist candle I'm about to light this up it's a two Wick smells just like the body butter like what it smells so good um aloe and clover when I tell y'all this is the best scent booster from buff City The Narcissist uh is this a body mess what is this it's a body mess and then they gave me a free sample of fresh cotton uh laundry detergent all that was only $40 I feel like it's pretty good um I don't expect this to last very long
 
 but oh my word I'm going to use this around the house instead of on me I'm going to in the air let get me wow that smells good that's potent maybe it will last what's in here oh the first ingredient is alcohol so it probably won't last but it says do not use on armpits um but yeah I'm going to light that candle so let's do um HomeGoods next so uh you all know this feel I just made about the fresh patch I don't know why I didn't think this earlier but I've went and bought some more pea pads so I can stop
 
 throwing away fresh patches duh oh wait hold on the dog is about to potty all right I was able to stop him we went to the fresh patch but uh I don't even know why I gave the fresh patch SP the reason why I bought more potty pads is so I can stop running through fresh patches because they're $35 a piece like this makes the most sense to put in place of the fresh patch but we did just get another one because I still want to Fresh patch train I'm going to just try to prevent him from pooping on it and I
 
 know what you're thinking how you going to do that very very very easy the poop dance and the PE dance for anybody that's a dog mom or dad you understand uh especially with small puppies you know exactly when they're going to poop and pee always comes before poop in these like small puppies um so if he has just peed and then he's doing a little dance and the little circle dance again I know he's about to poop uh so I'll put him on the pee pad instead of the fresh patch it's a lot okay it's a lot um but
 
 I I want him to be fresh patch train because it mimics grass and I want him to uh be fully potty trained again this whole sickness thing threw our training off I'm doing the best I can threw our training off by a ton cuz he still can't go outside um and he still won't be able to go outside for much longer since he got parvo and yeah it puts our vaccination schedule back a whole month he can't be vaccinated again which was his last round uh he needed one more shot um for another month so that puts
 
 everything back but I don't know I'm just doing what I can do but I definitely want to keep doing fresh patches cuz they're just too convenient PE PE pads you got to throw them away after every single use it's just it creates so much waste um but the fresh patch I really do like but I'm trying to keep poop off of it cuz it's not sanitary uh with the prob virus shedding and the poop but let's start with the homegood stuff so PE pads um I got two of these blankets for each boy I don't know how big they are I just
 
 picked them up cuz they were only $7.99 so that's a good deal he's in there eating the rest of his food I got quite a bit of toys so I got this dinosaur Juno's asking for them all but I'm going to organize before I give anybody a toy I got this dog that Juno had before but he ruined it so just another reup of that got this cute pig because it was cute and only $5.99 but the toys are so inexpensive I got this two pack of it looks like a bird and a ball a seagull it looks like in a ball I got three avocado slices with one
 
 has a Christmas sweater on and a Christmas hat uh I got this I guess it's a dog I don't know what it is um I got some more treats for Javi J can have some too and then I got some lofas for me um now not all of the toys are in the garbage more than half are everything that was out in the living room was trash except I saved a few for Java um so I wouldn't have to throw those away and then give him new toys then throw them away it would just be a huge waste of money so I saved some for Java cuz I knew he was coming home um so
 
 I put some aside for him and then those the ones that he playing with right now are going to get thrown away and um I have been buying Juno toys for so long I had a back stock of toys fortunately up in the closet if y'all remember from that one Vlog where he had his hand on it I keep a back stock of his toys so I was able to give him some of those which are completely clean Java never touched those because I never took them out since Java's been home um so I gave Juno some of those so this is just replacing
 
 what was in the living room I don't need to replace every single thing I've ever bought um so yeah I'm going to I'm going to organize before I give Juno stuff cuz I'm going to start cleaning and bleaching again tonight especially if he's coming out tomorrow so I just want to keep everything in one place to just make it more organized until I can get to everything let me show you all what I got from Zara since it just came in the mail I just ended up with two jackets they were on sale and I've been wanting
 
 this leather bomber for so long oh my goodness it's gorgeous it's gorgeous it's gorgeous let me give yall the code cuz I know you're going to ask me we go pause the screen do what you need to do to get this code all right I am geeked for this I'm so glad I waited till it went on sale and then I got this bomber which is like a I don't know I don't know what material this is but it's giving it's so cute it's like one of those structured type of materials so cute the blue it's so cute ooh ooh you got to ignore the collor
 
 that I have on but I think that is so freaking cute nice material looks so good with some jeans and then let's try this one on too again just ignore what I'm already wearing oh yeah I like this one this one's is double lined hi Java I like this one a lot yes I'm so geek for this one too oh yes been waiting on this I got an extra small on both by the way um but let me show you Trader Joe's now hold on let me put this away I forgot about these I had already given them to Juno but this one I don't
 
 know whose is whose honestly I got one for the crate which is mainly Java's place and then I got this round donut one I guess this one's junos all right let's do Trader Joe's now my sister called me okay hold on everybody hold on you crying too much um I got these crushed garlic like frozen crushed garlic I'm going to put those in my soup really good for soup just to pop them in there I got some celery some carrots some lettuce for my Caesar salad um bell peppers more frozen green beans cuz they are just too
 
 good two of these um mini French baguettes y'all these taste better than Olive Garden breast sticks I know Olive Garden is through the ground for me personally like they're done they shouldn't even exist cuz the food's so nasty but them bread sticks them bread sticks they they ought they almost about to redeem themselves off the breast scks alone but these with some garlic butter on top taste just like them too good too good too good trust me um more hash brown and more beef Bria cuz every time I go to tra I have to get
 
 at least one even if I didn't eat the last one cuz I will I [Applause] will and then I got some lies and some uh eucalyptus this is for the shower but be careful I heard that eucalyptus oil is toxic to dogs uh so the dogs are like not in the bathroom when I shower when I first get it but after like two showers you literally it it's done like it doesn't last long um plus they're never in there when I shower anyways but Java's plac is the bathroom so I'm not going to put that in there tonight uh and then I got some lies um this is a
 
 new thing for me it says sweet and salty Umami Crunchies rice crackers let's do a taste test but I need to wash my hands first so hold on um I got chives love chives so much got some rice for the soup love jasmine rice um and then I got some lemons cuz I'm obsessed with lemon water like so good to me and then in this one I they didn't have the lemonade that I like so I got some limeade I love limeade so I'm eager to see what that tastes like I got two things of chicken broth for tonight's soup the way I'm
 
 literally about to break a sweat I got another pasta sauce so good I got my Caesar dressing vegan Caesar please try this if you haven't oh my word it's so good to me child I got some um some Northern beans cuz I want beans in my soup y'all know I'm a bean fanatic like I just can't help myself I just can't help myself like if I make chili it got to be 90% beans uh so I want some beans in my chicken and rice you don't have to put beans in yours but I'm putting some beans in on and then I got some uh vegan heavy
 
 whipping cream because like I said I cannot eat cream of chicken so uh I'm going to use this cream to make it creamy and I got this hand cream for the car I meant to leave this in the car cuz y'all I'll be leaving the house in the morning and I'll be like my whole body be moisturized but my hands already be dry since it's so cold outside so okay whatever I got that for the car I'll put it back in the car when I go but I'm about to organize this tend to him because what is it oh he don't need me till 10 o' I keep forgetting um clean
 
 up a little bit and I'll be right back to uh start cooking this this chicken and rice soup now in with Java I went ahead and change my clothes really quickly also cuz I'm going to cook and I don't want him all over those clothes so I am here to play with him for a little bit give him a little bit of company and show you all the uh tricks that he can now do you want to show them what you can do Jolly come over here come here come here good boy good come okay you all he's very sharp all right y'all so with dogs
 
 this little I would go ahead and start training with simple obedience commands get down okay sit yes good boy and when you reward I would say something like yes good boy uh or yes Java good boy something like that or yes Java or yes in your dog's name whatever um Jun know's outside here it goes come here sit yes good boy PA yes good boy Jun actually taught him Paul I didn't really teach him Paul um he just saw Juno doing it and then he started to do it so I Associated what he was doing with the command that I wanted him to do
 
 and then he also knows down and then he knows spin so sit okay go down yes good boy he was very easy y'all and I think is because he SE on doing it now this doesn't mean that he's trained this simply means that he knows how to follow Direction and that's where you want to start because the dog that listens is an obedient one and if you can start with little stuff like this that'll make them listen you can work your way up to like a heel off leash recall skills a whole plethora of things he loves to be in my
 
 lap U come here come good boy come on okay sit yes paw yes go down yes good boy so what I'm doing now is just reinforcing what he already knows and then beyond this we'll start to like walk around the living room after he come out and we'll start doing leash training inside there's not much I can do in a bathroom like I can't teach them really heal in a bathroom cuz there's nowhere to really walk in here um I can teach him like spin I can't really teach him too much I can teach him come he knows that uh here he gets

V194	https://youtu.be/BgS3SHMjPsU?si=7PMZR54eEbYqKgS4	you know you get youry hair done and suddenly like the world is great again [Music] yeah welcome to another Vlog if you're new here hi I'm Aaliyah we're back home we're back in the a I actually was going to Vlog me traveling I just got back from London this morning girl a whole another story in of itself missed my flight it was the last last flight on Delta Virgin Atlantic to Atlanta last flight in general to Atlanta no no flights to Atlanta for the day I had to get back today I had a plumber and come
 
 in this morning so anyways y'all basically I had to end up flying in New York last night staying the night in New York leaving at 4:00 5:00 this morning back to Atlanta and now here we are couldn't couldn't even shower when I got home cuz my Plumbing there was an issue with my Plumbing so I had to have a plumber come today check all that out girl it's been a long day thugging it as y'all can tell from the appearance we ain't got nothing really going on today um so I was like I'm not I can't okay I'm tired I'm I'm tired so
 
 anyways I have some breakfast here I went and got coffee this morning before the plumber came but I didn't have time to eat my food so I'm about to eat this is just some granola and yogurt I have been on a yogurt granola kick it just is good and it's easy and it's allegedly good for you not if you eat it the way I do with all of this granola and these like sweetened blueberries but it tastes really really good hey mama if I I'm going to show you how many packages are at my door you're going to gag you're going to die there's so many
 
 P I don't even want to talk about it so on today's agenda I've already picked up Theo yes I'm talking about you Theo's here rosanna's here and then plumber already came um and now y'all I have to go get my nails done and I know you're probably like Aaliyah the first thing on your mind is getting your nails done when you get back home yes I have gremlin I cannot believe that's what my nails look like are you if you watching my last Vlog I cut all my nails off to try to like at least so you couldn't tell that
 
 like three were broken dis I cannot believe my hands look like this it is disgusting to me I literally feel so cuz here's the thing you don't have to have your nails done to look or not be like dirty the thing is is me without my nails done is dirty cuz my nails look at what my natural nail they're like so thin they look dirty like my natural nails they're like dry ashy like oh my girl I don't know my natural nails are just so brittle and thin naturally kind of like my hair like all in the same family
 
 basically so yeah I have to get them taken care of I'm so sorry like I cannot do it um I love and I'm very jealous of those of you have who have very nice Natural Nails you can take your your gel X or your acrylic or whatever off and you still fingers still looking uhuh uh when I take mine off stubby ogre hands I've had no nails for like 2 weeks no more like a week week and a half either way too freaking long so yes I'm going to go get my nails done first thing first Miss Taylor Taylor I missed
 
 her so much she's going to get me it together and my toes guys it's just disgusting it's it's really rough so that is what's on our agenda today I plan to go on a run so basically after I get my nails done depending on the time I'm hoping my appointment's at 2:00 I'm hoping we can be done around like 4:30 we're probably going to be talking a lot so it'll probably be more like 5: but basically what I want to do is run to Sushi from the park because I think I mapped out the distance it's like 2 miles which is
 
 only a little bit over like 3 km or so a little over that um but I think I'm going to run to Sushi eat and then run back running after eating sushi is nuts I might walk it back but yeah I want to run it I just think that that would be my motivating factor cuz today I was like damn I'm not going to have time to run like I'm not going to be able to run today and I'm really trying to be on it but I was like you know what I can run to go get sushi like figure it out that'll be a reward so I really want

 like a human again I felt like a freaking nasty yucky Gremlin before and now I feel stunning beautiful sex see all things above I mean I would love to have my hair done too but can't do that today so y'all seen I got a little ombre classic cute so it is 4:30 we're going to head to the house now and get ready to go on this run like I told y'all running for sushi I'm not playing I'm really trying to do my 75 Kil kilometers kilometers I keep saying kilometers it's kilometers girl you know what I'm saying
 
 okay so see yall at the house we're going to get dressed and then go run all right y'all I am wearing this fanny pack my black one is somewhere in my suitcases which I have not unpacked yet we're going to unpack those when we get back um so tan it is tan and fluffy um I'm bringing my wallet and stuff cuz like I said we're going to get some sushi after so I'm going to bring my little um osmo pocket 3 and I'm going to try to like Vlog each like kilometer as I go we'll see child cuz I be girl when
 
 I be running tired but this will be good for like here I am and it'll also be good when I get sushi to be able to Vlog and show you guys the food cuz um you guys always ask like what I get when I go get sushi so it'll be perfect for that so with that being said let's get a move on I'm trying to take both my phones there's so much I'm trying to fit in this little fanny pack um oh and then my headphones I told you guys I got these beats um they look like this of course I got them in this nude color such a neutral girl um y'all see
 
 how since I got my nails in I just can't stop I feel like myself again oh my God okay so yeah um and I get a lot of questions whenever I'm running number one question do I take water with me no I don't take water with me when I go run some people do I don't know I've just never done that I don't even like to run with this fanny pack but I'm trying to Vlog so and I'm going to go get food so I need my wallet um second question is how do I how does this go on oh I got it for the wrong ear how do I keep going
 
 like do I stop I do stop so when I show you guys my Pace um so for example last time I ran for like a mile I think it took me like 11 and 1 half 12 minutes to do one mile um and people like oh like is that including stops yes so I don't turn my like tracker off when I stop running because I want an accurate representation of truly how long is it taking me to run this mile so whatever my pace is is my Pace it includes if I have to stop if I slow down if I speed up it includes all of that so I'm not
 
 sprinting the whole time either y there's Parts where I'm like this okay so like just run out your own pace if you have to take a break take a break you you have to build your Stam up like I'm slow I horrible so anywh who going to put these in and we're going to get going I made like a run playlist if you're interested I'll link it down below this is what I like to listen to when I run I like to listen to music that got me feeling like yeah like like I'm really about that life it like keeps me going so okay let's go 1 km
 
 [Applause] down to down and I dropped you guys 3 km I had to stop for this one after 4 and 1/2 km we have arrived and that is almost 3 miles I deserve it to be honest I didn't even think about that sushi right now this might have been a bad idea [Music] I just did a little bit of a run what are you [Music] doing I guess I'm running back it's going to get dark soon so I need to be quick and I'm a little cold because I'm wet from sweat so let go we made it back I didn't really think that threw the
 
 best way running to Sushi made sense running back I also like I used to run during the pandemic the whole reason I stopped running was because I started getting really bad knee pain and y'all I haven't even been back running like that much my knee oh my God y'all I had to stop on the way back R 3 miles which was or right under 3 mies which was 4.36 km so I ran that there and then on the way back I only okay I didn't do that bad though I ran 3.12 kilm back and girl I had to stop my knee y'all I had to walk the
 
 rest of the way my knee hurts so bad so in total today I ran 7 a little under 7 and 1 12 kilm and basically like 5 miles which is really good my average pace form per kilometer was 6 minutes and 44 seconds um which I think my my first mile was like 10 minutes and 10 and 1/2 minutes um but my knee is just hurting I don't think I'm going to be able to run tomorrow for sure um so but I'm trying to do 75 km and I am currently it's only March 2nd and I am let me see how many kilm in am I 13 and 1/2 km total I'm

 side of bacon to put on top and then I also got a side of toast so I cannot work until I eat like I'm I'm starving I'm starving so I'm going to lay down till the food get here it's 9:00 I said I want to be done by 10:00 actually I should probably keep editing so I can be be done by 10: y' would be so proud of me I finished editing um it took me a little longer than cuz y know I wanted to be done by 10: I think I said I finished everything by like 11:30 12 okay well I a't do that good but I finished uploading it putting all the
 
 links in the bio all of that like it's ready to go thumbnail mini video like the whole shebang ready to go up so it's 12:30 I decided that cuz I couldn't figure out basically let me tell you what I'm about to do this I still have to do a story frame for Spanx cuz I did a sponsorship for Spanx in that video I still have to do an Instagram story for them but I want to be like cute when I do it so I'm like okay I'll do that when I come back because at first I couldn't decide if I was going to get cute and
 
 then go run out and do the things I needed to do and then come home and film or run out and do the things I needed to do then get cute you get what I'm saying like I didn't know what order I wanted to do everything in so I decided I'm just going to go out and get everything I need to do so I need to go grocery shopping but I also need to go to Marshalls I have a sponsorship with Marshalls on I can't remember if it's on Instagram or to but either way I have a short form content video for Marshalls
 
 we love that isn't that crazy so I need to run this Marshalls to pick up a few things um for the sponsorship so that's the main reason I'm leaving the house and then I'm going to go grocery shopping pick up a few things some stuff for dinner tonight some stuff for breakfast cuz I'm home for the week so I need to be able to eat and stuff I don't want to keep eating out it's just not what I'm trying to do um and then the other things that I have to do is I need to finish unpacking today and then um
 
 post my Vlog and then I have a few short form things that I want to film but for me to film those I need to get myself cute and I just can't figure out the timing for that just yet so we're just going to start by going out and doing the things that I know for sure I need to do so um I'm just wearing all neutral boring and basic U like I said I didn't have time to get cute so I'm wearing sweats I have on this sweatshirt I think this is from Zara if I'm not mistaken or cause I think it's from cause and then
 
 my sweats are Alexander Wang I just have on my A6 sneakers and then this little Polo hat which I really should not be wearing because it's sweated out it's going to have my forehead all broke out um and then I'm just wearing these little um these little Hoops these are from cause and then my little Huggies these are from ma the label so and then I'm don't mind all the breakouts the pimples y'all my skin going crazy and then for perfume I'm wearing something from L I can't remember the name Kyra
 
 gave it to me I want to say it's like something Blossom white orchid girl I don't know something like that so we're going to head out um I want to get a drink or something maybe a coffee cuz I have not had a coffee and I feel like that'll get me cranked up yeah so let's go got a coffee I went to park I had to park all the way behind the damn building it's so packed over here I forgot it was Sunday and it's like kind of nice outside but kind of nice I mean it's a little warm it's actually very gloomy but um the temperature is like 68
 
 which is like perfect like like Breezy walk outside weather so I got a coffee I got um yall know I really like Perk coffee I really do I can't lie um this is their Kito latte that I didn't think I was going to like cuz it has coconut in it but I love it it's so good so big hungry ass I got a damn donut I literally was like do y'all have fresh fruit she was like no I said well give me a donut then it's really not that good so maybe I won't eat all of it cuz for dinner tonight I want to make um Burgers so I really shouldn't be eating
 
 all this bread I bought that for no reason I'm not going to eat that I'm not okay so we're going to head to Marshall's it's not far so should be a quick little [Music] drive right so we going to get in here I'm shopping for spurring fashion so let go so we are inside I think I'm going to start in dresses and then pants oh they have my little sweat heads these are good for running cuz they're like mesh child this is not what we here for hold on so I found a lot of stuff the thing is though is a lot of it is sets and I'm
 
 like damn I a want to do a whole bunch of sets but like I'm a set girl [Music] why y'all the way I just blew a bag and Marshall should be ashamed so I got everything that I needed for my sponsorship and then some girl y'all I got this cute little like Chanel dupe purse so cute I'm hoping it fits right cuz I didn't like try it on it's like a little crossbody um it's so cute oh my God oh my God it is so cute y'all so now I need two things I need a Sharpie so I think I'm going to run over here to Office Max which is so annoying they
 
 didn't have any in um Marshalls uh they had like markers but not the type that I need I need like a black like a Sharpie marker because um I'm going to do a PR unboxing and whenever I do those I like to take a sharpie and like Scribble out my address well let me rephrase I haven't done this before but I was like I need to do that so that way when I'm like opening the boxes I don't have to worry about holding it a certain way or moving it a certain way because it's scribbled out you can't see my address
 
 you get what I'm saying so I'm right here Office Depot man what there's no parking okay hold on y I'm going be right back parking is so crazy what's going on your mobile device is still in the vehicle girl all right got the stuff and now we can go to Trader Joe's and then I can go home and figure out what we're going to do as far as like getting content done for the day so be really honest with yall I'm about to do something so ignorant right now because there's literally no parking and I just feel
 
 like there's no way you can call a tow truck quick enough to tell me so I'm literally going to park my right in front of the right all right yall so I'm back at the house I just walked Theo really quick um so I'm going to show y'all what I got from Marshalls for myself I mean everything is for me but I'm not going to show youall what I got for the sponsorship portion but I am going to show y'all um some of the stuff that I ended up just buying for me then uh I need to figure out I don't want to
 
 run until like 5:30 which is in 2 and 1/2 hours I feel like I can get myself together and film in an hour so I feel like I should be able to at least get myself together and film The Marshall stuff by today do you get what I'm saying anyways a whole bunch of hats y'all see when I was picking these up so I got a black one oh I was going to say they're the same ones I have on they're not this is a Polo hat but I like the Adidas ones too so I got a black one this cute like pinky lilac color a nude
 
 one and a blue one these aren't running hats like these aren't good for sweating but that's my business and nobody else's so I got these I got some more CLA Clips cuz I don't know where all mine went I be losing them and then I got more like little fanny packs yall know I wear these when I go walk Theo and when I run or just when I'm being active in general so I got some more colors they had this blue one and they had this like Gray colored one cuz at Lulu these are like $50 and even the one that I got on Amazon I think was like3
 
 so these were child $12.99 can't beat that and they're like um they're like sweat proof waterproof is a good it's a good little pouch y'all tell me this is not so cute I got this for $19.99 imagine this is like a cute little nude outfit I wish it was a little longer I knew the strap was a little short I could tell but it's still so cute you could even like just put it on the shoulder no like are you and it looks it looks like a little Chanel it's not it's Tweed and it's like nude and cream my favorite little colors
 
 this is is so stinking cute for $20 are you dumb yeah Marshall you did your big one so anywh who that's like the little things I wanted to show yall I got some other really cute stuff in here like I got a little BGA do oh Marshalls was hitting today I'm not going to hold yall that's everything that I got and I'm going to go ahead and put the groceries away you guys can just see that stuff whenever we cook tonight so if I can start running by 5:30 that would be ideal so then I can run before the sun
 
 goes down at 6:30 so I'm going to leave and get myself like do my hair hair do my makeup a little bit so that I can film this at least the Marshall stuff I would love to be able to film The Little P excuse me the little PR unboxing stuff that I want to do but I might just hold off and wait on that for a little bit we'll see o excuse me we will see so I'm going to go do that and I will talk to y'all when that's done I'll take y'all with me running let me know if you guys like me vlogging on that little
 
 camera like when I'm running and like talking to y'all and showing yall what's going on one or giving you guys like updates on like how many miles or whatever like let me know if you guys are into that if you don't care about that I can just cut that from the Vlogs um but I didn't know if you guys like like that or not so going to go get some work done TT L guess who just finished their work not even just I finished my stuff like a long time ago well not a long time ago maybe like 45 minutes ago
 
 so I finished I took off the makeup and stuff that I had on there's probably a little bit still left on cuz I just did some myeller water changed so that we can go for a run I don't know how far I'm going to run I'm hoping for at least 3 km 3 km child that be tripping me up anyways you get what I'm saying I'm hoping for at least three so basically like a mile and a half maybe 2 miles um I'm just wearing this little pink blush set this is Lululemon I really need to get some running clothes cuz this is not for
 
 running this is Yoga clothes so girl I be so w the the sweat don't it's not sweat wicking like this is not good for running so if you're like trying to like really get into running long distance this ain't the stuff you should be wearing this is more for like low impact this is for Pilates and yoga like and chilling you know what I mean but that's all I got so um and then one of my new hats clearly love the hats so um oh I need to go get my watch I have a watch on put my headphones in I'm going bring
 
 y'all with me oh and I just want to say like The more I've used these and ran with these the more I like them like I said the only downfall is that you cannot control the um noise cancellation so just keep that in mind ladies um for your surroundings uh right now it's daylight it's 5:00 like I'm about to be out in the park it's busy so I'm not really you know nervous but if you are running somewhere that's a little more secluded for safety purposes just you know keep that in mind but I really like
 
 these uh for workouts um because my I sweat really bad in my head like really bad um oh my God please stop playing music I sweat really really bad in my head um and so every other headphone like falls out of my ears once they get a little sweaty they be out they be falling out like uh airpods and stuff absolutely not and then my overe ear headphones are cool but they get sweaty and they're heavy like it's not really meant for cardio so these are perfect so I'm going to wear my en cloud let [Laughter]
 
 [Music] go okay so at 3 km my knee killing me um I think I'm G to try to do I'm GNA try to run the rest of the way back but this uphill I'm walking cannot be bothered back from the Run yeah I only did 3 and 1 12 kilm girl my knees started going crazy but I feel like I've ran every single day though so like I feel like that's decent um real hot outside too it's like very warm outside so mm- so I'm going to shower and then we're going to cook some dinner cuz I'm starved and I'm so excited we're going to be making um Swiss mushroom
 
 swiss turkey burgers yeah with sweet potato fries so good I got this recipe out of the little Trader Joe's recipe cookbook that I got on Amazon it's like a real simple easy recipe everything's from Trader Joe's cheap quick and delicious and I'm hungry so I'm ready for it all right my darlings we are nice and clean and it is time to make dinner everything you're going to need and then we're going to Montage the cooking process need some chabat rolls from Trader Joe's everything is from Trader Joe's if you
 
 don't have a Trader Joe's near you get a hamburger bun it really or I'm pretty sure you can find chabata bread somewhere else like it is not that serious this is literally just a turkey burger I'm pretty sure you can make it anyway you want also I'm wearing this little pink sweat pants and pink T-shirt these are from my outfit online so yeah Trader Joe's Trader Joe's toata Rolls Everything is from Trader Joe's so I'm not going to say that anymore turkey burgers s potato fries of choice onions some mushrooms and some swiss
 
 cheese only thing for this recipe that literally comes from Trader Joe's that like you do need I'm sure you can find a different version somewhere else but this calls for it from Trader Joe's it's a Trader Joe's um multi-purpose Umami seasoning blend this is the only seasoning that's going to go on the turkey the turkey burger and trust me it's fire okay so basically all we're going to do is cut up some onions and some mushrooms we're going to caramelize the onions um get the mushrooms sweated out and soft cook the burger put some
 
 cheese on it we'll season it with the seasoning both sides put the cheese on it toast up the Buns put the the french fries in the oven bow easy peasy lemon squeezy so I'm going to let y'all watch and we get cooking [Music] than [Music] they fighting for my life this is all that I got of my sweet potatoes french fries more like sweet potato mush best believe I'm still going to eat them now but now it's time to try our Burger last time I made this I didn't make it with onions I just did the mushrooms so I'm
 
 really [Music] excited so good y'all the mushrooms the onions the seasoning right y'all so I finished my dinner I'm exhausted I keep thinking like I'm going to gain my energy back and not be completely depleted and tired by 8:00 but every night lo and behold it is now 8:00 p.m. and I feel like I'm going to pass out and die so I'm going to go upstairs and look at my to-do list and just kind of get in the bed and go to sleep especially after eating feel like I have the itis majorly so good night it's
 
 Monday happy Monday morning I have been up since 4:00 a.m. y'all I laid in the bed for 2 hours from 4:00 to 6:00 p.m. watching Tik toks not productive not what I should be doing I can't find my iPad y'all I think someone stole my iPad and by someone I mean my cat hitter let me not put that on her you know we love to say somebody sto something and then we find it 2 seconds later but I cannot find my iPad and I know I did not take it with me when I went abroad or did I I don't anyways girl I can't find my iPad
 
 it's really throwing me off my my my thing I'm about to make some tea and then I have to get my beautiful morning started it's Monday morning it is currently 620 going to have some good old green tea this morning put some lemon in there there to just kind of cut the tea a little bit and it's good like for you whatever she want where my knives my teacup I was trying to just cut the corners of the lemon so I could like squeeze it but um this is like a really thick skinned lemon so there's like no actual fruit in
 
 these skin parts put some honey that should be plenty oh my God such a beverage girl in the morning I don't know about y'all but I have all the teas the coffees the energy drinks the water like everything just going so cheers good morning and happy Monday already done majority of my morning routine except for like my journaling and stuff because where the is my iPad um but let me show you what we got to do so it's pickup trash pickup day and um I have had some recycling that has needed to be taken for a very
 
 long time I mean months maybe even a year at this point I actually think it has been a year but here's the issue of why I haven't it's just been living on my third floor y'all see that y'all see that I don't even know so if you're wondering how I got it here from the third floor I threw it down here dead ass serious when I say I threw it I threw it from up there right here that's why it's right here um before I walk seeo I want to put this outside on a curb the thing is is they be acting real funny about taking the boxes
 
 it's a trash can don't Club and it's oversized and blah blah blah well what the hell am I supposed to do with it so today I'm finally um going to not be lazy and take it out there I think it's like four really large boxes and I feel like as long as I can get them folded up and in the bin there shouldn't be a problem that's just how I feel about it granted I ain't the trash man so I really don't have the final taste though but like what is a girl to do what difference does it make if I cut it up
 
 into pieces versus Fold It Up you get what I'm saying if you're wondering what what these boxes are from if I told you the Judgment that would proed the information would be excruciatingly glaring um so I think I might refrain it's from my closet mirror yeah that one how long ago did I show y'all my closet you know I'm going be really honest with y'all after I just did this somebody really needs to whoop my ass for the fact that I allowed this to be upstairs for as long as I did because I really overthought that let's have an
 
 honest conversation really quick before I take the step outside the I think that this is a great example just to show you how overwhelmed I get as a person this is such a simple task I mean this was I actually want to cry this was so simple and I have really put it off for an entire year because I convinced myself that this task was going to be grueling gruesome and not I was not capable it was going to be difficult task it was going to be a very difficult task it it's got to wait I even thought
 
 about hiring somebody to come take it away I think I really just need to sit down and like here's a task do that task complete that task check it off move on next task because why was this so the task has been completed and it was easy I don't even know why I was acting like that so now it is time to walk this stinker butt come here come on ready go for a walk Theo yeah oh time to take Theo for his walk isn't that right time to take Theo on his walk okay so we'll go do that oh my God I don't care this is how be walking my
 
 dog so when it comes to going to the gym I don't like to do my full skin care routine beforehand because I'm literally going to sweat it off and wash it my face afterwards so I'm just going to take some like warm water just kind of like refresh the face and I like clean out my eyes and stuff obviously I wish I had like a spray like the codly like spray I ran out of it I actually want to get a whole bunch of codly products so if you have any recommendations leave it down below cuz I want to get into their stuff I'm just
 
 putting on some moisturizer too for gym attire I'm going to put on this little blue L my eyes look like a 5-year-old like with my hair like this I'm going to put on this little blue Lulu Lemon set Gian said we're doing am wrap this morning which is as many rounds as possible so it's kind of like a hit workout so I probably should wear something that's more for like a higher intensity workout but this one I'm going wear cuz it's cute and then before I put my jacket on for deodorant this has been the deodorant
 
 I've been using I don't know if you guys remember when I unboxed this and I was like shame was sure came out with deodorant anyways I've been using this like crazy this is my second one um I like the moisturizing one they have a bunch of different ones they have different scents and they do different things like I said I like the moisturizing one I like the way this one smells also I feel like my armpits do be a little dry which is strange but it's true so I really like this um it works well in the gym it works well on dayto
 
 day so that's the deodorant that I wear my jacket on um I just have on like a black sports bra underneath I think this is from gym shark if I'm not mistaken we go okay so this is what the set looks like super cute just blue and we just going to go full-blown tacky bleue it out and I'm going wear a blue hat too cuz y'all know we went to Marshall's yesterday and I bought a bunch of stuff so I'm just going to wear this blue hat it is a different kind of blue so at least it's a little like it's still monochromatic
 
 but at least there's some variation I don't care it's cute I don't care I always like to put my hair through the hole I think it's cute and it gives you that like flirty Pony so I just gather my hair all up and but I don't put it in a ponytail yet and then I put it in this hand pull it through the hole of the hat and then put the hat on so then I can adjust the hat to where it needs to sit on my head and the way that my hair needs to lay underneath do you get what I'm saying cuz I feel like if you put
 
 your ponytail nice and tight you do your ponytail and then you try to put your hat on girl you're going to be trying to adjust like crazy and I'm I got it too big on my head so I'm going tighten this I wear my hats way too tight like I be having lines on my forehead I can't help it I like it's hot ponytail we back on it should be fine my tapes are screaming in the back cute yeah normally I would put earrings on but I lost my little Hoops um my little gold ones I think I left them in the hotel in New York when I was coming
 
 back um from London I don't know girl but I can't find them I don't know where they're at I might go put some studs on or something um but I do need to buy some more like small Hoops cuz that's like my everyday earring that I like to wear um for perfume I got so many compliments I got so many compliments on this perfume Kyra got me this SL Pink Magnolia I literally could not remember the name of this for the life of me when I was telling y'all about it yesterday but um when I went to get coffee like
 
 everyone was like oh my God you smell so good you smell so good so we're going to wear this these oh okay okay God dog butter fingers these excuse me these are the shoes that I wear to the gym these are APL sneakers I bought these years ago because of Alysa Ashley when she first started like well not when she first started when she was you know Alyssa is a gym girly so um when she was doing recommendations on like shoes and just different things like that that's why I ended up buying these so I wear these only when I'm like

D224	https://youtu.be/BGD29BfITAk?si=KvAP8jCijzQIJJzH	today's topic revolves around the number one missing Trace mineral in arthritis for arthritis a lot of people are taking vitamin D and they may not see the difference other people take a lot of magnesium for the joints and they also might not feel much difference unless they have this additional Trace mineral involved and that is boron now let me explain what Boron is it's a trace bter that we don't have a lot of studies on but there's a lot of data relating to arthritis I want to share with you Boron  seems to be the key Trace mineral to allow calcium to work to allow magnesium to work if you're deficient in boron you're going to have excess amounts of calcium magnesium in the urine you're going to tend to get more calcification in the soft tissues you're not going to have the strong bones so Boron really helps keep the mineral inside the bone and allows vitamin D to be activated and help this whole process work Boron also prevents tooth decay like in tooth cavities if you don't have enough Boron you're going to have more  inflammation in the joints because Boron helps reduce something called C reactive protein you may even find that you're getting receding gums kidney stones calcium in the arteries and calcium in the joint because you're deficient in boron the tissue that contains or stores the most Boron is something called the parathyroid gland let me explain very simply what the parathyroid gland does it SE four small glands around your thyroid and what the parathyroid gland does is produces a hormone that helps  control calcium so let's say for example you don't have enough vitamin D or you don't have enough calcium well the parathyroid hormone will increase to extract the calcium from your bone pull it out so you have have enough calcium so you can look at the parathyroid hormone as kind of like another vitamin D and what's interesting about the parathyroid hormone is you need this Boron to allow this whole thing to work even if your levels of vitamin D are normal in your blood you might have vitamin D resistance and this  is where the parathyroid hormone starts going higher and higher and higher even know you're taking vitamin D well it's because you have vitamin D resistance but it can also be you're short in boron so I think a lot of people are deficient in boron because they really haven't put it on the radar as being something they need also if you're low in boron you're going to have low amounts of testosterone you're going to have low amounts of estrogen now when doing a deep dive into nutrition I always look  at research on animals right because sometimes with humans the research is kind of like hidden andar bued but for Animals it's it's usually out there and I found something interesting with horses if a horse is deficient in Boron their heads start shaking because they have a problem with the trigeminal nerve that causes pain inflammation and they're trying to do something to get rid of it well magnesium in boron gets rid of it pretty quickly there's even data that Boron can help decrease the risk of prostate cancer as far as the  amounts of boron to take I would recommend starting out with like 3 milligram three times a day and see if your problem is resolved after a period of 1 to 3 months now some people take a lot more uh Boron just so you know like some people take like 30 milligrams a day you have to realize that the toxicity level of boron is less than Salt and the heavy tilling of our soils have depleted a lot of these trace minerals including Boron so I just wanted to put Boron on your radar just so you know it's out there and when it  does there's a little more data to know about arthritis if you haven't seen this video right here go ahead and check it out 
M224	https://youtu.be/EVEKGQTnwoM?si=0UNZaqt6HL-7lQax	[Music] hi psychic twin its I'm Terry and I'm Linda this is about the law of attraction what the law of attraction it's it's like a law like gravity's the law basically it just says that you get in your life whatever you focus on whether those thoughts are negative or positive in other words whatever you give your energy to it will come back to you in some form or other there's no if Center but you're constantly flowing thoughts that are either positive or negative or combination of both and if  you become aware of those thoughts and whether you're flowing the resentment or joy or anticipation or passion enthusiasm or negativity and anger you will get back exactly what you're flowing so it's really always working like the law of gravity is always working whether you believe in it or not and that's it's actually a part of the law of gravity the way it works so any thought is going to attract to you what more of what you're thinking and any feeling that you're feeling is going to attract to you what you're  feeling so it's sort of like a magnet in a sense it is it is a magnet lunk attracts like if you're feeling excited enthusiastic passionate happy appreciative for what you have even if you don't have what you want yet then you're sending out positive energy to the universe and the universe will bring it back to you eventually and you'll get what you want eventually if you continue to develop this positive habit of thinking correctly and I know it's kind of a complicated thing if you've always kind  of been negative like oh I'll never do that I'm not good enough to get this I'm trying I'm trash I'm useless I mean whatever it's going to sabotage your best intentions of getting what you want because the law doesn't care who you are or what thoughts you're flowing it'll just naturally get you back exactly what you are flowing and what you feel you deserve so the universe through the law of attraction will respond to both of these vibrations in other words if you're thinking positive thoughts you  will attract more positive things that you want in life and if you're putting out any negative thoughts or languaging negatively you're gonna get stuff you don't want so it really helps to pay attention to everything you're thinking feeling and it's really a mindfulness kind of attitude you have to really become very aware of everything that you're thinking and doing and feeling it's not the easiest but we actually have proven that it works because we've been practicing the law of attraction consciously for over twenty years and  we've been able to gradually improve our lives in almost every way we ask the universe for what we want and then unconsciously we tend to block that thing from coming in by sabotaging it with our words thoughts and our biggest doubts like I'll never do that that'll never happen to me oh I'm glad that happened to you but that could never happen to me it's like I'm gonna be a millionaire yeah that I'll never have this right kind of I think so you're immediately canceling out your attention yeah because these are the beliefs that you  may have inherited from your family members from your teachers from even your church leaders by watching TV or watching bad YouTube videos you tend to get a lot of negative input and then that becomes a part of your reality and the thoughts that you unconsciously flow and so what we're going to do is to talk a little bit about how you can shift that that tendency it becomes a habit to be more positive as you go through the day well that's what a belief is it's really a habitual thought and it's a  thought that you repeat over and over again until it becomes a belief most of us don't even question what we believe we just think oh well that's the way it is or that's the truth but once you start analyze I'm really looking at the things you believe you start to discover that there are a lot of beliefs that aren't even true for you and you're like why do I even believe this yes it's not true for me once you begin to kind of taste analyze it take stock and assess your beliefs about almost any subject you can  probably discover gee that's not really what I believe it's just what my family believed and I kind of adopted that way of thought unconsciously so it's a very powerful teaching the law of attraction it's more powerful than the law of gravity in a sense just because it can change your life and it can create a new reality for you your thoughts create your reality you can't really get what you want if you focus on what you don't want the emotions like jealousy and anger and resentment will block you from  attracting good things that you want in your life and so what we want you to do is put your focus on the things that you want and the emotions that you want to feel usually when we want something it's because we want a sense of freedom or joy from that thing like oh when I get married I'll be so happy well it's sort of like reversed you have to feel that joy get a sense of the joy first before you can attract that perfect maid and marriage partner it's like pretending that you're in that feeling place of  receiving that wonderful romantic partner or enough money to pay all your bills just when you need it you will have it it's up to you really to create that reality if you're not positively affirming that you can create this you will receive the opposite and then you'll complain and say well I just have bad luck I have bad karma and some of it may have to do with karma but a lot of it has to do with your attitude your attitude and gratitude of what you have right now whether it's what you really desire to  have ultimately or that'll magnetize more of the good stuff don't focus on what you're missing you know don't focus on lack or oh I don't have enough subscribers yet or I don't have enough money yet or I want a house but I don't have it so don't focus on the fact that you don't have it try to get in the emotional feeling place of the joy how good it feels to have that wonderful home that you've always dreamt of and it might help to even write in to journal about what you want to achieve and why and how you want to feel how it  makes you feel to have that thing well I think it's good to write down your goals in a journal and maybe tape them to your mirror so you look at them every day we really are as human beings we're vibrational beings were we're made up of energy and we really are like magnets like attracts like you become what you think about and focus on and feel the emotions are extremely important here every thought has a frequency every emotion has a frequency so if you're not getting something you've always wanted  it could be that there's an emotion or maybe a subconscious thought that you need to deal with and we'll teach you how to do that you basically do attract your dominant thoughts so whatever you practice whatever thought that you sing over and over again all your life that becomes your dominant thought and that's what you're going to attract today you were raised with no money at all and you you grow up thinking I'll always be poor all always before and then when you grow up you won't be able to make more money  no matter what you do if you make money you'll lose it because your subconscious has the dominant thought I'm going to always be poor that's right so choose your thoughts carefully and again write them down and really start being mindful of what your thoughts are and what your dominant thoughts are so basically thoughts that bring you good feelings mean that you're on the right track thoughts that bring you bad feelings mean you're on the wrong track so there's something you might want to investigate there why am I always coming  up with you know a negative result in my life regarding any subject and then we might notice that you have a habit of thinking negatively that would be unconsciously sabotaging anything you're desiring so when you have happy feelings and emotions of course you're going to be attracting happy experiences in your life so get that happy feeling of expectation like an expectancy that you're going to have good things happen in that life is going your way you may want to say that as an affirmation life  is working for me I have a great life and wonderful friends around me I'm attracting higher vibration friends people that are happier more successful life works well for me my life is going well I'm in the divine flow what you focus on with your thought and feeling is what you get in your life it's that simple but it's not that simple to shift a whole lifetime of habits that might be creating a negative result so as we mentioned it's really important to feel good to get in the feeling place of having what you want right now that is  probably the most powerful thing I mean you can recite that I want to feel good all day but you're not really doing it practicing feeling good there's a lot of ways you can do that you know you're going to keep receiving the same negative results over and over because you're not really getting in a feeling place emotionally and that takes practice sometimes it just helps to go to a fun movie a funny movie sometimes it helps to you know journal or go out and take a walk and shift your focus talk to somebody that's a positive  person reach out to someone that you think could help you shift your state of mind yeah I mean I remember when I first learned about the law of attraction and it was many many years ago and I remember thinking are you kidding me it's okay to feel good I can't I can intentionally feel good and it's okay because I was so much in a hat just always working and sweating everything and stride rumbling and striving and I just couldn't believe that intentionally putting myself in feeling places in environments that felt  good that I enjoy doing that I wanted to do fun things and that that would pay off by attracting more good things I couldn't figure it out it didn't make sense to me because it with having joy and feeling happy with so far from our reality there wasn't something that we were ever taught I think this should be the first thing that they teach in schools actually because there's more important that number is it's more important than anything I totally agree that should be included in all curriculums and so it should and and  when you're feeling happy and you're doing something that you enjoy you can really change your emotion and your thoughts almost immediately so it's it can be very dramatic if you just practice it for a few days you might notice that people are a compliment anymore or you'll be receiving opportunities for work that you weren't receiving before yeah you'll notice it I mean we see a lot of people write to us and they say I was in I was going to kill myself and I saw your video and you put me in such a good mood and I was  laughing and I a completely changed from my attitude and my my feeling completely changed my emotions completely changed so you know watching happy videos encouraging inspiring videos can really bring you out of a depression but it can change your life it really has yeah we're not talking about Pollyanna like you can only think positive thoughts all the time and be this happy person to everyone else you know and you might be a comedian who you know actually focuses on negative jokes and that gets a good  response that's fine if you go home then and you continue those negative thoughts you know then then you have a problem because you are not actually placing yourself in a mindset where you become magnetic to the good stuff you're staying stuck in the resentment that made you write those jokes but then you're not shifting out and that's what we're trying to teach you now so you really are the creator of your own life and destiny nobody else can create your life for you and even if you were raised  in an environment where people controlled your life all the time and you weren't allowed to do anything that you wanted you can still change that and you can have and create the life that you want so you really are that powerful start by saying I'm happy I'm grateful for what I have you know and write things down that you're grateful for every day a few things write it in your journal and then right before you go to bed say you know what am i grateful for what did I accomplish today the more aligned you are with positive thoughts  and feelings the quicker you'll pull things into your life that you want whether it's a job or a relationship or a new car you know this is it has a practical side to it it isn't just magical thinking here we're talking about a kind of a mindset a mindfulness it puts you in the vibration of really making better and wiser decisions for your life and then you will just naturally attract better and more things that you want I think I make better choices yeah for your life in relationship career whatever maybe what  major you want to go into there's so many ways this can improve your life the law of attraction is a law again it's not a matter of that it applies to some people and not to others the subconscious is always operating 24/7 and so it's almost like your positive thoughts during the day are like fueling your racecar through life that you're going to be noticing that you're moving to higher and higher levels of understanding and then manifesting exactly what you are hoping for we've had so experiences where we didn't think  something was possible but because we focused on it and we were chanting for many years we talked about a previous chanting that helped us to shift out of our negativity and negative belief system into an extremely positive optimistic attitude and some people say well what do you do well we took we talk about this a lot in our book psychic intelligence and other books we've written books like it get elegance we'll teach you a little bit more about this so you can learn it too so the Buddhist said all that we are is a result of what  we have thought well ask yourself what is the best feeling thought that I can think right now that'll shift my vibration because you can do that just stop in your tracks and say what's the best feeling thought that I can think right now yeah and it could be something as simple as I am looking forward to the Sun coming out later and I can go for a walk it could be something simple but it will shift your vibration it'll shift your mindset this is the year I deserve to have a harvest my manifest abundance  this is the year that I'm gonna change my negative money karma we're gonna teach you more about that in the next video which will focus on how to attract wealth and prosperity so focus on the things you're grateful for right now and visualize it we're going to talk about visualization the subconscious mind is very visual and it really helps if you have things around you to inspire you and motivate you so we recommend doing a vision board and this has been popular for a couple of decades we've done a  bunch of vision boards and what it is it's a collection of pictures and images and firing sayings or quotes that you just pasted on a board it could be now it could be think of the illustration board a poster board or you know cork board some people use and they put it on their wall and they look at it every day and it can serve as a real source of motivation for you to remember what you want to create in your life maybe it's a beautiful home and you cut beautiful pictures of a home by the water that  looks just very peaceful and inviting and cozy you want your vision board to be very very visual because that usually operates very powerfully on the subconscious and impresses your subconscious with those images so then it's almost like magically working on your inner self to go after these things and believe you can create them this is an interesting experience because we know for a fact that vision boards - were we used to do great big ones and we would have wonderful colorful pictures and sayings and quotes all over the  board we had this amazing experience where we wanted to be on The Oprah Winfrey Show and Oprah Winfrey back in the 90s she was the queen of Allah media and she had this talk show that we used to watch all the time and we were like we want to be on The Oprah Show and we put a photograph of Oprah Winfrey on our vision board years later after her show and if she started network called the own network and we were on Nightline beyond belief which is it was a separate national it was a documentary was a  supernatural series and we starred on Nightline beyond believe is 2011 well you won't believe this but Oprah put us on her network doing the supernatural series that we had started in on Nightline and it was like amazing like we've it was a magical Alicia yeah and I think we were even on another network but remember the own channel before if he can't you know get back in the 90s yeah we were actually on another channel of her so a couple times so oxygen-oxygen ever said Jeff when he was a part of oxygen network - so it really  was manifest he on different and yeah quite amazing so our job isn't to worry about how we're going to attract these things that we want to us just do what we tell you to do and then the universe will figure out how it comes to be yeah I know that sounds whoo-whoo and spiritual but the universe has a lot of power and Sirte you to attract what it is that you want and your job isn't really to figure out how it comes in it will come in and very often you'll you'll be thinking it'll come from this because I'm doing so much  with that with this YouTube video and then it'll be that's like seeds you're planting and then it'll happen the benefit will happen somewhere else in your life you'll get an opportunity to do something not even related to YouTube for example and so that's happened to us a lot where you're finding a lot of seeds and you think it's gonna happen from this but it's gonna happen over there where you weren't even looking or expected that's something that we learned through 30 years of chanting is that you chant for something over here  that have happened and something else happens over here that's even better yeah so don't be too rigid about controlling how it happens or what it happens or in what form it comes in don't be attached to what it looks like because it almost never happens the way you think it should happen or will happen be open to the magic because what we're saying absolutely so how can you attract more of what you want have a clear intention write it down believe you deserve it so try to find the sense of inner joy  and peace and then all other things appear that you want the same with relationships right yes absolutely it's just a matter of treating people the way you'd like to be treated and treating yourself the way you'd like people to treat you that's it and I think that's something people miss they think it's enough to take care of everyone and treat them you know with kindness and compassion but then they treat themselves like crab and they're telling themselves a negative things about themselves all day  that is an example of what not to do when you're trying to shift your focus and your resolve when you're trying to get a better result so if you want people to respect you you know really be good to yourself and respect yourself first and focus on the things that you like and respect in that other person it could be somebody that you really hate or can't stand try to find one thing that you like about that person and your pool not only pull that out of them more you know you might even find that you're  friends with that person it's happened to us many many times a lot of it has to do with forgiveness but we won't talk about that right now write your script so think of your life as a remote control and you get to punch the buttons that you want to get the show that you want and it's it really is kind of magical how it works you know we can program it program you like every programming a reset of your life and it's it's a fun adventure it is this way it really is it becomes a fun adventure as long as you don't get in your own way  yeah and everything is energy so once you realize that you can really flip the script on everything in your life so to recap the law of attraction is basically the idea that every thought you have creates your reality and it creates energy focus on what you do want instead of focusing on what you don't want it's that simple to start anyway your thoughts generate all the actions in your life and we want you to learn to shift the focus to create and creation it's so powerful you are the beginning  of everything that will happen to you in your life worry and fear and resentment tend to create a self-fulfilling prophecy if you think the worst will happen and you go into a job interview thinking you're not qualified and they're not gonna like you you will get no request to you know to come back in for another interview you won't get that job because you were unconsciously flowing I don't deserve this I'm not right for the job I'm not fully equipped for this I can't handle it and so the self-fulfilling  prophecy happens because you were not flowing your thoughts in the most positive way and don't beat up on yourself if you do because we want you to be good yourself be kind to yourself and give yourself a break because we are all having green thoughts and habits that we really basically just absorbed from other people since we were conceived so pay attention to how you feel during the day or feeling joyful and optimistic and enthusiastic about the day or what you have to do during that day or are your thoughts kind of  resentful and wishing you didn't have to go and complaining that you do have to go to a job you don't really like so that's what's called a life condition and your life condition reflects what your thoughts are and if you're feeling crappy then just know that you can shift out of that and change it and reset your focus - feeling good deciding to feel good no matter what is going on around you okay so share some of your stories and experiences with us have you studied the law of attraction have you practiced the  law of attraction and all we'd love to hear your stories and experiences in the comments

 helping remove cancer for dozens of years uh to over thousands of patients and so you studied the material brain but also the spiritual side of the brain as well the mind let's say yeah and you're an expert in both and the last interview we did we talked about many different things around these topics but you have a new book called This is why you dream what your sleeping brain reveals about your Waking Life and this is interesting because we were talking before that there's not really anyone who's a scientist of Dreams out in the
 
 world yet except for you're starting this path you're you're starting to talk about the Neuroscience of dreaming which I think is fascinating because you told me about a third of the time we don't remember what we're doing in our lives third of the time we're asleep and a lot of us don't remember our dreams we don't understand our dreams they don't make sense to us we have nightmares we have erotic dreams we have inspiring dreams we have dreams where we feel like we're falling or dreams where we feel like
 
 we're about to die and then we wake up in a shock we have all these weird moments sometimes we remember and we we we we overemphasize what the dream was but it really didn't happen and then other times we have no clue what happened in our dreams and so why after dozens of years of doing brain surgeries being a PhD in neuroscience and understanding the Mind did you want to dive into understanding dreams I mean you put it right where it needs to be this is a big topic there's a reason people haven't been tackling it cuz it's
 
 like trying to grab a cloud or like trying to hold on to something that's just like we all know what it is we know what dreams are we all have had dreams I don't have to explain to you what a nightmare is you know what it is I know what it is we don't talk about it we can't really wrap our minds around it but it's something we all experience is something we all undergo so your question about why did I want to write a book on dreams what I would tell you is I was asked to write this book so the way I've my journey that's ended up
 
 here uh a lot of it is you know I have sons I have three as we were talking about they're 18 19 and 22 I've taken care of thousands of cancer patients um I've done surgery in South America that these experiences are also part of my resume now I happen to have a PhD in neuroscience and I'm a neurosurgeon but there are other neuroscientists there are other neurosurgeons I believe and in this conversation when you see me hear me say I believe or I wonder or could it be it's out of respect for you and your
 
 listeners because you you don't want anybody come in on this topic and saying aha I got it all figured out one two three no it's an exploration I'm looking at fragments and pieces across broad scientific things I'm bringing my own stories into my own experiences and I'm saying look look at these little they're almost like fireflies these little glimpses of knowledge that we now have or that 3,000 years ago they were talking about lucid dreaming they being Aristotle like what is the consistant pattern uh not not my dream not your
 
 dream but what if we look at 10,000 dreams do we start to see some patterns we do and we'll get into that nightmares and a dreams are essentially Universal falling dreams and teeth falling out have happened for hundreds of years across cultures like when you went from carriages to cars to electric vehicles to television those dreaming patterns are consistent so the first thing I thought wait wait a second they're being driven by the brain then when Technicolor came in dream reports people cataloging what
 
 dreams are going on right that's where I'm studying is like how what dreams happen most commonly what dreams don't happen at all so two things popped into my mind I was looking at this and saying when color TV showed up the dream reports of thousands of people being asked woken up in their sleep what are you dreaming about uh the dream started to be more in color so clearly Waking Life fed dreaming life and then the other thing I noticed was rarely did they report math in dreams yeah I don't think I have a math dream thank God that
 
 doesn't sound fun but but there most people we look at 10,000 dreams everybody's at a nightmare nearly every when in science I say everybody I don't mean 100% it's like you know above 90ish it gets to be essentially Universal nightmares and erotic dreams very few lots of emotional dreams lots of visual dreams a lot of movement dreams and we'll get into that but very few math dreams right like very few people said and even the scientists that say I came up with the idea of dreaming it's a visual thing like the snake eating
 
 itself for two comets moving apart and what I realize now that those you know what we dream and now the last 20 30 years we could have brain scans that's a that's a simple word but we're going to dissect that in this conversation like the metabolis how much glucose your brain is using where is that glucose being used what's the electricity so when I say brain scan there's a lot of different ways of scanning brain information the brain scans at night in a machine with people sleeping with people dreaming they were
 
 notably dampened not off let's change all of this there's no part of your brain that's off otherwise it'd be a stroke you know that part would die but everything in the brain is a modulation it's always like 5149 nothing is ever on or off it's not a switch there's blood flow always going everywhere okay if a branch is blocked then you have a stroke what happens is the executive Network in the prefrontal cortex just the the part of the brain behind the forehead the the part that does reason and logic and math it's it's
 
 49 it's 48 during the right now it's probably 51 52 but it's dampened at night and so dampening the executive Network in our dreams allows for them to be illogical allows them for to be wild in my opinion and also explains why we're not doing math because that's needed for math interesting so then I just it took my breath away I was like wait a second so some patterns of dreaming from thousands of Dreams can be explained by some patterns of the dreaming brain and that was uh the idea in my head and uh
 
 my publisher in London penguin UK um we were talking about doing a different book that's going to be the the next one hopefully but um you know she said we we we need we and I think she meant like the publishing world and readers and people in general like they're they're real they're they're real you know they put out books that are like french fries I love french fries but they also want to put out some stuff like look this an important book we need a book about dreams explained about the science of it the
 
 story of it a love letter to dreams because there is no dream scientist you it's not a field I'm a neuroscientist with live experiences trying to put put together brain scans dream reports uh neurons in a Petri dish to to put together a story of what I think is happening in dreams and dreaming wow that's how this started this and it's just what's that happened has been an ignition in my mind for about 18 months so there's been a there have been reports on lots of different dreams right there's been like people
 
 documenting their dreams and there's is there studies around that great question first of all again not my dream or your dream but there are great dream Banks uhhuh uh people for decades have uh woken people up in sleep labs they put an electrode on to make sure they're sleeping and they say hey wake up what are you dreaming about and they're wrri it down yeah yeah so that that world's been happening okay that's where I'm getting like the uh you know certain percentage report dreams of falling certain
 
 percentage dreams of uh you know uh being chased a certain percentage of M really that's yeah everybody nightmares everybody sexual erotic dreams okay so you I that pattern is not mine right it's what other people methodically have been cataloging by people either sending in writing journaling uh or sleep Labs being you know woken up and that that's where I'm getting those patterns do you think our dreams have meaning in our Waking Life well that is the that's the massive question right so that's the
 
 that's the um um what I would say is is let's go backwards a little my answer is yes but but to be able to share with you how to go by go about extracting that meaning yes one it's going to be individual I I can't tell you what your dreams are about and you can't tell me what my dreams are about so it's a process of self-examination yes uh dreams have meaning not all dreams right not all a waking thoughts are fresh or or you know or important or worth holding on to but what let's get to that is can do dreams have meaning
 
 but with your permission you know let's let's AR let's equip people with what is happening in the dreaming brain yes and then what different dreams mean so then they have a Playbook at the end um yeah and what I would say is the dreaming brain is this was the essential question is okay so you got all the dream patterns right so we got what we dream you looking at what people have catalog uh to make sense of why we dream that's your essential question that we get to and then there's this like this
 
 this thing like like the the dreaming brain and the waking brain right like and so and I believe these big ideas are applicable to everybody like getting groceries frustrated why am I stressed out why am I overreacting like all the all the things for living a better Waking Life you can't separate them from that that that third of your life you spend sleeping and potentially dreaming right so I go way way back to try to understand this and to make sense of it for myself and and I think you'll find
 
 there's there's science and there's stories but there's synthesis so first thing is all life is is governed by the rotation of the planet let's just start with square one like let's just get to the basic here like like whether it's like those hot springs deep in the ocean and there's some bacteria there or a venus fly trap that opens and closes or the moon and the tides um or sleep right like this is this is governed because that was the foundation on which life arose right and when when you look at that what I would
 
 say is the material the living material on planet Earth follows that whether it's the tide or the Plankton or you know all migration but also the material in our brain really like there's nothing in our skull that if you pieced it out there's no special ingredient like from Krypton or something everything in nature is also everything inside our skull in these brains right that's connected differently it's functioning differently but that was like the first thing that really tripped me out I was like we too
 
 follow the laws fundamental laws of Earth's rotation and these circadian rhythms you're hearing about and cycles and and seasons and that was the first time I said okay so the brain is the brain is the the waking brain and the sleeping brain are doing a 24-hour cycle for as long as the run you have on this planet that's the first thing that cycle it it actually you know there was like I love this topic by the way I like this like go there are like people who go into for like 6 months it's still in
 
 a cycle oh like it's not based just on dark black ey Shades or not like we we the tissue in our bodies the cells it we're following this Earth's rotation okay so if we say that there's the waking brain and the sleeping brain and every 24 hours it does its things two3 waking one3 sleeping and that and that happens for the most part you know for how long you live now a surgeon in training I'm might skip a few nights um so maybe I've had 500 or a th000 nights but overwhelmingly I follow this cycle
 
 too and in that cycle we have to ask ourselves well what's going on in the dreaming brain and right away I'll tell you it's so important there's something called Sleep pressure you could you can do you could defy a lot of things but you go a day without sleeping there's something Building inside you saying sleep sleep sleep you'll fall as sleep in a dangerous spot you'll fall asleep standing up sometimes you'll fall asleep even though you haven't eaten like there's something fundamental called Sleep pressure that makes us follow that
 
 that Rhythm right your body will force you to sleep eventually well I would say your brain your brain just shuts off it's it's it builds a pressure you can startle people and they'll wake up but at some point there's this pressure that's bringing you down to sleep really that that you see that we I think torture techniques were based off of that we saw that we nobody could stay up a third night in the hospital they tried to get us to a long time ago the battle day really yeah but two night second
 
 night you could do third night and po so there's a sleep pressure that the brain generates not the body the brain because in just to give you just examples like we're talking about like regular examples we're not trying to get we'll bring the science in but the the complexity is in the um in the concept I can we can put Hearts from one to another livers from one to another lungs from one to another uh they all follow the that person's brain's order so really what we're talking about is the brain is saying I need to sleep brain is
 
 saying I need to sleep brain is saying okay there's some threat going on or You' got some some demands you're running an ultramarathon you're a surgeon on call I can go a day but I need to sleep so that's the first the first thing in this discussion is why do we need to sleep oh now I'm going to be bold here this a conversation I I think we sleep because we must dream now let me just set that up for you wow what happens when you go without sleep you have surges and RAM and dreaming sleep right away first thing you do when
 
 you've gone a day without sleep if you put that person in a brain scan but there's Exquisite ways of checking it is that they they first thing they do is they dream wildly right like so that's that's an interesting thing to me the longer we go in our night of rest quot restful sleep the more you're dreaming on the tail end M right so maybe mental Clarity if we take that phrase comes from having that longer night sleep well what happens in that fifth sixth and seventh hour you're dreaming more so when I start to see
 
 these patterns I wonder One the brain not the body needs to sleep and then what is the brain doing in sleep just check this out man it's it's doing something that if you put electrodes on the surface of our scalps and we all fall asleep at night during the day the waves the the measurements are uh you know sort of wavy there's different ones depending on how you're engaging at night there are some sharp 90minut [Music] patterns that stuff is designed that's built in really yeah so that's not new
 
 we don't have that when we're awake no during the like if something startles us the the electricity will be different if we if we meditate the electricity will be different during during waking but at night you're on you're on something programmed then that's not new Louis that's the stuff that I we I've known for 20 years and sleep people have known for 40 years what I'm trying to do is give you an explanation a synthesis that's not random that's not a glitch 7 billion brains on 24-hour cycle sleep pressure you got to
 
 lie down you got to sleep the brain is saying you got to sleep and when it sleeping is doing this 90 crisp Cycles REM sleep you've seen the the charts they're like they look like Lego they look like the top of a a Tetris thing or a Lego thing that is something fundamental that's happening in my opinion and so that's why I think we must sleep but I think what's the most important part of sleep is the dreaming my kidney and my liver don't need to sleep you could take part of the liver from a mom and put it in the child
 
 it's no longer connected the the transplanted liver to the to the web of nerves liver's fine lungs are fine moving between humans wow right so you what I'm trying to point out there is that it's the it's the brain that's running the show it's on the Earthly pattern it wants to sleep and in that sleep what is it doing KN it's dreaming the brain in my opinion with respect and humility the brain needs to dream the the sleep is so that the brain can dream and stay fine-tuned and stay fully adapted and
 
 stay fully enriched in all the corners of his mind without just the boring boring part of our day right if the brain only did what we did driving the one ofone or doing this which is fantastic but it would become rigid right it would become like like an arm that's never stretched past a certain distance right you get a contracture well the brain tissue my opinion that dreaming is the brain's way other people have other ideas like it's threat training or it's a nighttime the therapist I get that and I think in some
 
 capacity but at the most fundamental level it's like high-intensity training for your mind at night it just goes wild to make sure all those capacities and resources imaginations if you will are accessible to you if you needed them during the day if the environment or uh you know Evolution needed it so that's like the big explanation about what's happening when we sleep We're Dreaming dreaming is important it's metabolically active it's electrically active it puts us at risk and even if you are in D danger your
 
 brain will force you to lie down so it can sleep to dream and that's how fundamental I think dreams are now what if people that's that's powerful glad you shared that and what if people are listening or watching say well I can't remember any of my dreams and I don't think I dream at all yeah cuz I can't remember them that's so what's wrong with me and should I be worried if I don't have dreams well I would say the genius is built in so that that's happening whether you want it or not and the essential question
 
 of I've had people ask me that like well if I don't remember my dreams is it useful I mean what is it well if you're not remembering them so let me take that one apart a little bit here's my thinking on it we'll bring in imagination and even Sports visualization to try to understand that and we'll bring in something called autobiographical memory so let's start with memory first okay it's it's not what you're seeing on TV or like you know remembering names or addresses I like I like my phone I don't want to
 
 remember phone number again you know like there's that kind of memory then this procedural memory like riding a bike tying your shoelaces uh then there's episodic memory remembering episodes of your life right so we have lots of different shades and types of memory and the one that connects me to the fact that I was here with you maybe about two years ago was something called autobiographical memory when I I have gone through so many different things in so many different countries and places but I feel as if I have been the uh I've
 
 inhabited and lived through all of those experiences think about that right what's the thing that stitches all my life together that's a type of memory it's called autobiographical memory and and so I think by design by and importance um it it's to some rare cases it's to a away avoid waking and dream confusion so it has this wild run at night but when you wake up and we'll talk about that transition like this the transition between a a dreaming brain and waking brain it's not a hard line it's a little it can be fuzzy in the
 
 morning and that's why some people report sleep paralysis and goblins and weird stuff but um the autobiographical memory has to come back into command because that's what stitches are waking life together that's what's get food get to work get on the subway so the autobiographical memory takes over every morning when we wake up and for it I think for us to stay to not be confused about what reality is cuz we had such a wild ride it it there there's a the memory is designed to have dreaming Fade
 
 to the background and so I think I think it's it's happening electrically it's happening and what we're catching are a few glimpses of it bleeding into our waking brain and say o man last night what was going on in my head right those those are the glimpses and the flares of the dreaming brain bleeding into the Waking Life and those are the ones that that um that we want to pay attention to you know so that's the that's the way I'm I'm thinking about dreaming and trying to explain it too okay there so
 
 many questions I want to ask here but there there's different types of Dreams there's nightmares there's erotic dreams there's weird crazy dreams there's sleep paralysis and I think I know what that is cuz I think I've had that a few different times so I'd love to start there because this is something I can relate to where I've woken up but not been able to move or speak yeah and I feel like I'm screaming but nothing's coming out yeah what is that terrifying I know right but you're asking me to like you're asking me to
 
 tackle Giants of giants of mystery tell me everything what it is yeah in one afternoon you know but but what I again W with humility if you hold on to the concept if you just if you just say look that was look this we don't have to do a study but I get what he's saying we're on planet Earth we clearly have to sleep right our brain I I believe him our brain is the thing that needs to sleep and now what he's saying is um that hey check this out while you're sleeping you're you're dreaming whether
 
 you remember none of it a little of it or some of it you're dreaming okay if we if we if we hold on to that and then always come back to like if one person later On's like huh I am a cycle of waking brain dreaming brain just if you just walk away one thing like you're waking brain dreaming brain 24 hours waking times whatever life is waking brain and just to ask yourself is this contribution to my thinking to my emotion uh from The Waking brain or the dreaming brain or or somewhere where it where Blends so when you uh sleep
 
 paralysis um a third of people have experienced it I haven't but when I wrote started writing about sleep paralysis the what you describe about uh this is this is great just give me a minute to take this one cuz this one I got a lot of science when you what the dreaming brain also does is not just hyp hper emotional and Hyper Visual and dampen logic right that we we open with Hyper emotional hyper visual dampen logic okay so that's there what it also does is it locks down your body so you're temporarily paralyzed right
 
 there's some exceptions or reflexes or sleepwalking but in general you're temporarily paralyzed so the dreaming brain can let loose be emotional be wild and in the morning that paralysis has to come off interesting right that's an that we can all agree on right that's that's the dreaming brain and the waking brain when there is a mismatch um of you waking your dreaming brain the mind is coming to but the chemicals that have locked down your body right the chemical paralysis is still there people will
 
 wake up locked locked in their body that's kind of what you're describing yeah and then on top of that they start describing goblins and monsters and different things lurking Intruders I've never experienced I never experienced that either but that's described so much so that if you go to Italy you go to Africa you go to other places they all have a similar story of being locked in the body and having a threatening presence in the room and sometimes a feeling of Suffocation wow that grouping is something humans
 
 experience and something cultures have come up with their own stories about so if people want to look it up like succubus the incubus and succubus come from that and it's a famous painting with a goblin on top of a woman who's asleep but right what I want people to go is ah I see that sleep paralysis that LS brought up was because the dreaming brain and the waking brain they don't just snap to the next phase that sometimes they bleed into each other and that's called Sleep exit that little window is called Sleep exit sleep entry
 
 is a fascinating one too but sleep exit I've almost I've had it a couple times at night like in the beginning of sleeping also where I've like fallen asleep but like 30 minutes later I've like woken up it's almost I'm not asleep yet that's my favorite time I am from minute and so my fiance says I mean this is just from her uh theories but she says you know that's you entering a lucid dreaming like allowing that to happen allowing the sleep paralysis to happen because you're half awake half asleep and if you stay there and you
 
 don't freak out and scream like try to scream you could actually enter she says that's what happens for her and she enters the most incredible lucid dreams that are vivid in memories for her she's not wrong and so it's more of just like surrendering to I can't move so she's not wrong but again so you know people are like what are they talk like if you just if you if if you keep this conversation on the framework of dreaming brain and sleeping brain dreaming brain and waking brain then you know where the explanations land so what
 
 you're talking about is the waking brain entering the the sleeping brain the Sleep worlds yeah the very good the and that again doesn't happen like in a millisecond like you don't blink your eyes and go into that mode it bleeds and I remember this how to I explain I was in I was diving the wait I don't do it anymore but I was diving in the caverns of like the yukatan and where the fresh water meets the ocean water crazy there's like four feet or it's like Blurry and I was like yeah it's not going to go from uh freshwater
 
 river to oce and like what like a hair there's a period of overlap interesting and so if you hold on to that uh your waking brain is starting to enter your dreaming your sleeping brain that window there's a word for it it's called hypnogogic and hypnopompic forget about that I like because I want to have a conversation sleep entry sleep entry is also a 15 20 minute period where you can kind of be in these Lial spaces where you're you're like remembering a lot but man I'm having some wild thoughts lucid
 
 dreaming is when you've been asleep and then the uh awareness your in a dream returns that's a whole different topic so she's right it's a blended State uh your significant other but sleep entry has been channeled by Salvador Dolly and others and in movie Inception as a place to extract fresh ideas your fresh ideas might be great my fresh ideas might be bad I'm not saying that's the way to be become a creative genius but people have used that window and now there's some devices that that when they see you feel
 
 you falling asleep they'll wake you up so sleep entry is the blurry movement from uh the waking brain to the dreaming brain and that is an interesting uh space for creativity sleep exit is the dreaming brain to the waking brain and sometimes the body stays locked in and locked down and the mind comes back and that freaks people out that's called sleep paralysis wow that's that's my synthesis and I that's interesting now this might be off topic here but I'm curious to have an optimal day is it better to wake up organically
 
 without an alarm or to wake up with something that is alarming you okay when you wake up so great question first of all because now we have the concept so if you believe your dreaming thoughts are ones you want to hold on to if they're nightmares maybe you want to forget but nightmares won't let you forget that's a different topic they're they arrive in children for a different reason but what I do now because I have the luxury of a bed and curtains so it's out of respect for all the people in this world that
 
 don't have that but I believe when I have had a good idea actually forget that my last 100 bad ideas have come from somewhere in sleep entry and sleep exit and when I'm driving around I or whatever I'm you know I'm in LAX or he thr whatever it is uh when I go oh that's interesting thought that a it's not aha moment when when you have a thought that you don't know where it came from I believe it's from that nightly process that's going V interesting that work you're putting in at night on your own the design for the
 
 brain to dream to stay creative to stay enriched uh to activate emotions and sights that are Way Beyond what you would even tune moves forward during the day right we'd become so boring if our brains didn't dream at night right the capacity would be constrained so when I have a interesting idea I try to think about did that come from my dreaming brain or have I been working with that so I've been giving these talks on creativity and people so there's an incubation period and extraction period I believe habits during the day well
 
 this like like colored te television more color dreams put some red colored goggles on people and they had more red colored dreams I believe like I do things like I like to flip through magazines or I listen to different music and I I take different routes home I believe I'm feeding uh my dream life and then at dream at sleep entry or sleep exit I try to hold on to what was I thinking about what was I thinking about how did I feel about that what was that going on and to do that you you can't have the alarm which is a
 
 luxury and the first thing you can't check is your phone cuz the minut you check your phone right that autobiograph autobiographical memory is onto the day what you want is that autobiographical memory thing that stitches every day together not to come on so fast and to some people I mean you can read about it but the concept is there to slow down the uh the Sleep exit or to pay attention to the Sleep entry and jot down or hold on to those windows and I believe for me whether it's coming up with a new surgery coming coming up
 
 with an idea for science or working with the LA ballet now or writing like when I have had a good idea it's come from those spaces interesting so not from being rushed and waking up with an alarm and going right into that's important you got to you know shelter and food and get you got to stay staying employed showing up on time like I'm not it's a luxury but if you're really trying to take yourself to the next level my process for extracting ideas uh is is to work with my dreaming wow that's amazing so you mentioned
 
 nightmares why do you think kids have nightmares and also kids or teens start to have erotic dreams at the same time yeah um and I'm sure they wish they had more erotic dreams than nightmares but why do why do we need both erotic dreams and nightmares as we're growing up all right so again we return to the the foundation of our conversation that um these are back to what we dream okay like that's been described for a long time I'm not I'm not coming at this new right like and so when we look at the pattern of
 
 what people dream um you know there simple stuff like oh you you have a flight tomorrow you have a dream about missing your flight you don't need to interpret that you know what that is you got a presentation tomorrow you have a dream about showing up naked or something behind the podium like we know we get that uh but why would you have nightmares like that this chapter 2 for a reason cuz I wanted to come across and just say look this is a work of imagination it yes that there's nobody that can take these few glimpses of
 
 Science and life and come up with like a foolproof hey I got it all figured out story so here's what's interesting about nightmares um if there's anything that would make somebody say look hey this dreaming thing is not good for us why why do we have nightmares like that's like it feels like a glitch right it feels like the mind uhhuh uh uh like a mind's mistake if you will I don't think it is but so when you look at the patterns um to understand it there are two types of nightmares and there's the
 
 one with the big idea but let me get to the other one that's easier if if you have been traumatized assaulted P PTSD nightmares are flashback there a bad memory on Loop stamped with raw motion can't shake it that we have some firmer understanding of so if you're struggling and you have uh worsening headaches you say hey I got to think about seeing a doctor if you're an athlete you have worsening pain the key is if you have worsening new onset and Progressive nightmares talk to your doctor or therapist about it it could be a
 
 psychological thermometer that things aren't going well for you that's a big topic and I think other people are in that space I'll leave that one there yeah the one that interests me is having three sons and uh is each of them at one point I had to say to them it's all right it was only a nightmare it was only a dream so the first thing I thought was does that mean they didn't and I'm looking at I'm looking and now I'm looking at a neurodevelopment to understand this I want to a whole different space like how
 
 you know we're not born walking and talking right so you see kids they're putting things together the movements become fluid you're physically mature not born made and you're cult cated physically right I believe the mind is also being cultivated internally and one example would be you got to remind kids it's only a dream so that means at some point when they're young likely they're confusing or cannot separate uh dreaming thoughts and waking thoughts that and at that time when you ask them what they think about it's very
 
 in general I mean this one kid might tell you the wildest thing I'm not telling that person or that parent that that's not what they're experiencing but the pattern is um the dream reports of children and some families signed up for this I've just I studied it they followed their dream reports from like Age 2 to 20 wow longitudinally like what are you dream about now what are you dreaming about now what are you dreaming about now and their dreams are simple it's like a table or a blanket interestingly when they dream of
 
 animals they're not often pets they're like beasts and monsters and teddy bears so I can't un explain all of that but that's what they're describing it's not the pet that they have that's in their dream and as we're learning to walk and talk to h23 4 something's going on in the mind there are some structures just I need a moment for this one there there's a type of cognition that's developing first is visual spatial and and then these these developmental scientists they looked at it that the wildness of kids dreams
 
 correlates more to the complexity of how they navigate visual spatial things they have a test called block design it's not how well they can spell or remember the more three-dimensional they are the the that parallels complexity of dreaming in a child so all all the parents out there you know make them memorize you know in my opinion I had to like cultivate their sense of gymnastics music art whatever you can different foods different diversity experiences it's not being correlated to logic right
 
 so that also like makes me feel like that's that guides a little bit and then what happens is they develop this thing called at some point they realize it's just an example that that teacher or that Uncle or that person that they're smiling and saying hey uh I want to help you but the capacity develops it's called theory of Mind where you start to read the other person's intention Beyond just what they're saying interesting yeah that develops kids are kids are gullible that develops theory of mind yeah to people
 
 can look it up theory of mind so that's a just like there's a uh me I can throw the ball like that's develops at a certain age around five or six seven and it the idea of that person's intentions may not be completely clear or they might be misrepresenting their intentions or maybe I shouldn't trust them or maybe they would hurt me these important Concepts arrive in the brain at the same time as nightmares arrive wow so I think if I were to say why do we and then these nightmares all go away for kids and then as adults we get them
 
 if we have trauma they come as a wave interesting it's crazy right wow I might be completely wrong but I you know I would love to hear somebody come up with a better so you're not just gullible all the time what everyone says I think nightmares make the Mind nightmares make the mind yeah they make you sharp they give you a sense of self versus other they make you less gullible they create a sense of threat they they the the fleeing and the terror I think it guides the cultivation of this thing called
 
 theory of Mind where you realize just because the person's smiling that doesn't mean they have good intentions interesting and that is is cool right I mean that's they they're not not arriving for all of us at age eight 6 S8 and then fading for most of us as we get into adolescence without a reason like that's not that's not a glitch in the system wow my belief I wonder again with humility I'm I'm taking on big things here so if that's not what it is for you I I believe it I'm not saying I got it
 
 all figured out but I'm just here to show you like and then people and that we are in many ways still that dynamic as adult so whatever you're T at the grounded level your struggles with your love or your struggle with your part like you're a dynamic ecosystem of mind and body and I just want to take people back to like look at that like we're not and there's a certain part of the brain that gives you that capacity like there it's we'll get into that some other day but in that part the the newest part of the brain
 
 that pushed the forehead forward there's a part that when it's injured it doesn't work well we can't like make new opinions or we become gullible like there's some cellular basis to the theory of Mind wow but again I think n nightmares arriving for all of us at the same time as we're becoming like oh that person might hurt me or what do I want self versus other I mean self and italics um I think that's all happening in parallel for a reason wow I think that's all happening in parallel chapter two so if nightmares make the mind what
 
 do erotic dreams do okay so the these are my that's why it's just chapter 3 I know everybody's going to want to hear about this one but it's you know it's PG-13 but the but the I think the concepts are you know very mature um so again we again we returned to our primer that there's this we are waking brain and dreaming brain and they intersect we we stab we I think everybody knows that it's a matter of to what degree and how um that's the other Universal dream you know I've never had a dream of teeth
 
 falling out but it's been reported for centuries I've had it yeah yeah a few times so there dreams follow patterns right um people have dreams of falling but that's like 20% 60% like you know I had that too but but I've had dreams of fine but not you know but everybody's had essentially I mean there'll be some people say no I've never had a sexual dream okay I'm not here to majority majority I mean way in scientific terms everybody yeah yeah so I call those two Universal dreams nightmares and erotic
 
 dreams Universal Universal dreams um and I think when something is universal a part of our there's awesome feels out there like evolutionary psychology like the gifts the strengths and weaknesses today aren't just physical that we're inheriting thinking patterns dreaming patterns um and this is mind-blowing but this has been well known I'm just able to put it I think into a framework now is falling teeth dreams they don't follow they don't teeth falling out it doesn't follow a pattern in people but
 
 nightmares cluster in families think when I say exactly I the scene yeah and I've known that cuz I went to medical school and they said that I just didn't have a understanding of it but I believe and there is evidence that we inherit not just our physical traits but our cognitive traits oh yeah and if we inherit our uh risk aversion or or propability to risk if we inherit our uh our parents coping mechanisms or failure to cope um you know we may be inheriting dreaming patterns interesting and I think that
 
 that we have to be open to that that that's why nightmares all right for every kid man that's not happening by chance I may not have the explanation for it I think it cultivates the sense of self uh and sense and gives you mind reading ability with somebody else else uh that's called theory of mind that's my opinion then the next one comes is H sexual dreams and this one is is uh interesting because let me break this down for you it's different because when when my sons were born and we born with like the marble you you
 
 know it's and what you youve heard this use it or lose it you know like if you cover a child's eye because they have some health issues that part that goes to the right side of the brain and left side one each eye goes to both occipital loes it's not this one to this one is this Crossing M if you cover those parts with they repurpose right it's a it's an Adaptive system um use it or lose it you've got the neurons the 100 billion neurons they're like microscopic jellyfish use them or you're going to lose them that
 
 makes sense and that's what happens for vision hearing taste movement if you wrap somebody's arm the motor area will wither wow okay so that's that's built in but this is but how does a touch become a caress that's a capacity from the same from the same sensation um now it can become erogenous right right there there aren new nerves being laid down in our fingertips right but when when a lover a Lover's touch is different than a intention even right not even a touch just so that capacity develops uh in in the human brain uh
 
 around the time of 11 12 and 13 interesting and it's it's not after puberty it's not like puberty however people conceive puberty but you don't go through bodily puberty and then say I think I'm turned on it's different you get turn you you you your brain develops the ability to be turned on I believe through erotic dreams wow that erotic dreams are again the mind's cultivation for desire and then you start to see changes in the sensation part of the brain where now it's not just now erotic touch is
 
 possible you know without getting too deep into like child rearing and all that but sensuality arrives it's not CH prepubescent it's not it's not there it must come at a certain time and around that time people who have never had uh intercourse people who have uh been castrated chemically for cancer treatment people who have had chemotherapy people have their ovaries removed they still have herotic dreams really it's not the body saying I like it let's think more about it I think it's the other way around wow and that
 
 it arrives and in the biggest sense wouldn't that be an important thing for for people to procreate that desire arrives and the fact that it Ares before so here it's not use it or lose it you know it's here you go it's time to use it it comes before it's ready very good yeah so it's something it's I I would love a conversation at a different time with somebody else with that that doesn't follow normal neurod devel neurodevelopmental Pathways usually it's like yeah I can see and if I cover an eye I lose that ability you're sort of
 
 equipped and then you cultivate here it arrives and the again erotic dreams like in that J Co song wet dreams he says he I think I'm smashing but I'm but I'm sleeping wow so before he has his first relationship intimate relationship with this person uh he's he's rapping about like he he's performing the act in his dreams in his erotic dreams before they even happened in real life that's not the usual order of how the brain and nerves work so again my humble opinion is wow um erotic dreams um are the embodiment of Desire
 
 they they make sure that we want and that's advantageous for us as as creatures species and people do you think the brain and the mind have to dream something first before it can actualize it in real life that's a big question um do they have to dream something or think something first before they can actualize it I think there's two ways to think of that there's the things you there's the things you want and you pursue and the way I would look at that is um returning to another example is that
 
 the the dreaming brain and the waking brain is one is one way to understand it but the structures in the brain during Waking Life they're called the executive Network the one we talked about are damping down so if you have a goal pursue it this conversation is not to be like hey just dream around all the time like you got to get after stuff you got to get things done and that's the executive Network and that's what drives you to your goals you can think about your goals you can choose your desires
 
 and I that's that's been most of my life um but then the role of Dreams in that I think are twofold one because I have thought about this for myself it's again it's my story I with respect um I believe that if I have chosen a goal with my waking brain it's been you know contributions are coming from my dreaming brain I'm incubating thoughts it's feeding me it's feeding some aha moments I'm using sleep entry I'm using sleep exit and then the bigger one for me is are there things I want are there
 
 things I hope for that my waking brain just does not have access to and that's the big question in the beginning like what's the meaning of dreams and then you know if we look at what is happening in the dreaming brain returning to our is that it's hyper emotional it's hyper visual and this is some real profound stuff when I was learning about this and reading about it the I can't get into brain anatomy too much but I would just say the executive think of the if you flatten out your brain the executive Network would be
 
 like different continents and countries going going revving up a little bit and the imagination Network which is liberated in the dreaming brain it's different other countries coming up you know it's like bager water fall some come up some comes down like sure it's it's a toggle um and so your brain at its most emotional metabolically electrically is in dreaming you can't you can't rock that hard during the day really yeah by measurement so then it says to me so if there is a meaning if the if if I can gain further insight into
 
 myself I must look at the way my dreaming brain is exceptional I'm not going to look at my dreaming brain for a math solution but I might look at my what my dream brain is putting forth uh for an emotional solution an emotional Insight right like that's that's the thing that really I mean a lot of this is um but the meaning of dreams is that the act of self-examination with the recognition that I hope you leave today is that's a hyper emotional state what is the value of emotion yes it's profound when people
 
 have injury to these areas they can't even make any decisions like decision making requires emotion Instinct requires emotion my my dog Frankie she knows when I'm sitting in the booby trap like he we're going out for date night Frankie come here she's like there's some Brilliance to emotion right and we have become again don't get me wrong you got to wake up you got to go to work you got to get it done like that and that takes the waking brain and that takes the executive network but if you want

P232	https://youtu.be/57miEE6sVDA?si=ySjK6-N1FtK9_IXk	but then I kind of looked and concentrated and it was all of my other lives I need to make a decision whether or not I want to go back to the physical world or stay on the other side so my name is Amber Kavanaugh I live in Canada on Vancouver Island this brings us to yeah December 22nd of 2021 I was 40 at the top of my game Loving Life coming out of covid kind of and being able to celebrate Christmas we spent the whole day making gingerbread houses and just having family time and that night we were sitting on the couch watching a  Christmas movie and all of a sudden out of nowhere I did tend to get headaches like tension headaches weird sensation and then a super bad headache like it couldn't open my eyes type of headache and I'm like you know what you guys I don't really feel well and I I was going to be cooking Christmas dinner for like 30 people on the 20 forth and like I'm gonna go to bed and so I went to bed it was only maybe nine o'clock and around 10 or 10 30. I texted my husband from the bedroom because they were still  watching the movie I said you know I have such a bad headache I can't even see straight can you bring me a Tylenol and an Advil and he did I took them and I thought then I fell asleep I think I fell into unconsciousness the headache was my carotid dissecting on my left side and when you your carotid dissects it actually I guess is painful and causes a super bad headache and so I fell asleep and then my family did the normal stuff went to bed stuff like that and I didn't wake up until think about 4  30 or 4 40 in the morning and I woke up thinking I thought I was dreaming and my bed is really high up the stroke was on the left side so my right side was affected and so it just so happened I was able to kind of push myself up not realizing I was completely paralyzed on my right side and so I stood up and when I put weight on my legs my right side just gave out I crumbled to the ground and I was I still didn't know what was going on I didn't even think stroke so it had dissected and I had had a stroke  and it ended up being a completed stroke so I had an MCA ischemic stroke and it was my mca2 and if you catch a stroke early you can stop it and stop the deficits from happening or or reverse them but mine because I didn't wake up went all the way through my mca2 and it was complete so it all was dead and because I hadn't woken up it caused a secondary frontal lobe broke so essentially I'm missing two-thirds of the left side of my brain now so I fell to the ground and I didn't understand what was  happening and I still thought I was dreaming and I didn't realize like your brain doesn't tell you you're paralyzed I just didn't understand how why I couldn't move I couldn't do anything and so I'm like I just need to get to the couch I need to get to the living room to get my husband because I also couldn't talk I I couldn't scream I couldn't make a noise um and so I tried to Army pull myself across the floor and I couldn't that there was a wall right there and I don't know how long I was trying to crawl it  seemed a long time but it probably was only a couple of minutes and I banged like five times super hard on the wall and my husband had actually been sort of startled when I fell out of bed but when he didn't hear anything else he went back to sleep and so he came in and at the same time I woke up my mom because they live in our basement suite and so she was like what is that and then came up just after him and he came in the room and he tried to pick me up and he's like what are you doing on the floor and  he tried to lift me under my arms and it's very hard to lift dead weight and he he's like what is going on so he put me down turned on the light walked around looked at my face and he said I think you're having an effing stroke so I got to the hospital and I was still completely conscious and they bring me into triage and they were talking and chatting and laughing all the paramedics not looking at me not anything and there was a nurse facing a different way checking in patients to the ER and he  turned around and he looked at me and he said what are you guys doing she's clearly having a stroke what are you doing and he picked up the phone and called a stroke code and everything from there on went super super fast I was in the CT within a couple minutes as I was in CT my husband came they saw the karate dissection they saw the massive stroke I was in my body still but it was very I don't know I was kind of disconnected a little bit and so I could hear them saying things about what they can do what they can't do it might just  be permanent it's pretty and but they decided to give me TPA which is clot busting medication that works 50 of the time also has a very very high instant death rate and with that medication you usually see Improvement very quickly and they didn't nothing came back nothing I didn't start moving I had no reaction to pain stimulus I couldn't hold up my arm it was completely paralyzed and because it didn't work there's only one other option which is brain surgery and they didn't do it at the hospital in my  town so they needed to life like me but there was a storm coming and the helicopter didn't want to come and the nurse the charge nurse it was amazing got on the phone and started screaming saying because my kids had come at that point because the doctor and nurses said that they need to come and say goodbye because more than likely I would not make it to the next hospital and so I could hear her screaming I'm not gonna watch these kids watch their mom die on Christmas you are going to come it's  like a 15-minute helicopter ride so you need to come and finally they agreed and the helicopter comes and at this point I was barely conscious I do remember people saying goodbyes a few of them I remember my kids saying goodbye I remember a couple of my family members at this point people had been waking up and so my family was calling my other sisters and other family members and so they were coming to say goodbye again because I wasn't probably going to make it and they were very clear that I was  probably not going to make it because the damage was so extensive and so they all said goodbye they strap you into all of these things for the Life Flight because you can't move and stuff like that and it was a beautiful day all of a sudden the sun was beautiful it was early in the morning still maybe nine o'clock and I do remember being pushed towards the helicopter going in the helicopter and my husband was allowed to come in in the Life Flight uh they're normally nobody's allowed but again they  thought I was gonna die before I got there and so they didn't want me to die alone we got in the helicopter they take off and when we got up to a certain height the sun came in the window and hit my face as soon as the sun hit my face that was it I was on the other side my body was still clinging to life and I could see it I could see my husband I could see my body but I didn't have a lot of attachment to my body it was like I closed my eyes and opened them and I was in this beautiful garden the grass  in the water was not like nothing I've ever felt in my entire life I think I wasted more time feeling my feet in the grass than actually making this decision to come back I knew without a shadow of a doubt that I was there to make a decision and nobody was going to make it for me so I think my experience was a little different than a lot of people's because I didn't feel super pushed either way everything kind of glowed with like essentially the light of God there's just love that radiates from  everything and I wasn't alone either my guy who I had gotten to know very well since I accepted my gifts were there they were sitting on a bench that I kind of would sit with them for a bit and then get up and walk around very Strangely I guess for some people my husband was there and my kids were there I didn't talk to them but again my belief even before the stroke was that our higher selves are always on the other side they're always there connected to us but also connected to all the other lives we're living I saw a  couple of my animals that have passed and actually I saw one that hadn't passed that unbeknownst to me she would pass before I got out of the hospital my mother-in-law who passed away in 2011 and then to the side kind of there was a huge group of people dozens and dozens and dozens maybe even hundreds I was like well that's weird like I I don't think I know them but then I kind of looked and concentrated and it was all of my other lives there to support me again we're all kind of one so we can look separate but we're not actually  separate and so my guides were super helpful and they said I I need to make a decision whether or not I want to go back to the physical world or stay on the other side and I was very aware that this beautiful garden although part of the other side is kind of like an area where you can go when you're still human or attached to a human body and I knew that if I died I would go to a different place the garden for anything the other thing that's kind of interesting in a human way is I looked like the best version of  me my I was 40 at the time but I looked 25 I was wearing a beautiful white eyelet dress I had no wrinkles and I just I had no laws no weight like heaviness to me and I had no pain even though my physical body at this time was still in the helicopter I was clinging to life they were trying to keep me alive to get me to the next hospital to have brain surgery but my guides told me what was going to happen with either choice and once I got there I knew everything I understood everything every choice I had ever made in my life made  sense everything that I had ever regretted as a human or things that I had done to hurt people made sense there was no question there's just on all knowing that your life was planned to learn you're doing it right there's no judgment there was not one moment where I felt like any decision ever that I should regret so having that knowledge and having the ability to take away that human Amnesia that we're born with in order to survive here made the decision so much easier because I could kind of remove myself a little bit and they  showed me what my kids life and my husband's life would look like if I didn't go back and I still didn't feel sad because I knew innately that they would have chosen and planned that as well they showed me what I would do if I did go back I would write books and I would speak to very important people about the gift that we're giving or given to learn and they showed me that 18 months after the stroke I would be able to learn a lifetime's worth of patience to prepare me for what was coming but they also  told me that 18 months especially the first six or eight would be the hardest time I have ever lived and I have not had an easy life at all full stop I've had a really difficult life but again it's kind you're kind of removed from that like okay yeah it's gonna be horrible but like everything feels so wonderful here I can handle that I didn't really realize what it would feel like to be completely paralyzed and not be able to talk at the time my body was paralyzed and I was not verbal I wouldn't be able to eat or drink or go  to the bathroom but I still didn't feel like I had to do something one way or another they really let me just sort of look at all options and try to figure out what would be the most comfortable for me there was a bit of a guiding energy of God I didn't see God I know a lot of people think God's an old white man he's definitely not God is more of an energy and something else that was interesting was that there were no words everything was telepathic you just knew as soon as you were there that need to only hear things was gone it  felt like I was there 50 years I know I wasn't it was minutes it was in the helicopter until I landed got in the next hospital and then I had a grand mal seizure because of the my brain swelling and my guide said if you are going to die you're going to have this seizure and they're going to try to resuscitate you get you back you you'll go back and forth a little bit and then you were going to actually die at 12 22 on December 23rd and so that was my physical time frame again I was still alive I just wasn't attached at all to  my body I was on the other side and when I finally made the decision that I'm going to come back again nobody pressured me they just showed me my past present and future with either choice I decided to come back and in the instant I made the decision I was out of the garden and that was it and I'm like what but I didn't go back to my body I went to this I want to say a light filled waiting room but it wasn't a waiting room it was just this light filled all-encompassing area where then I could just watch me I could kind of see my  family still but my my soul was back connected with my body and I got to make the decision whether or not I wanted to be in my body with the seizure because they can be really painful and I didn't want to so I got to stand and watch I could see my husband and when the seizure happened I was in the hospital I I started sneezing and grand mal seizures look really scary and it took a long time for it to stop and so I watched that happen and as soon as the seizing stopped your body goes into like almost like a comatose state you fall  asleep really deeply and that's when I joined back to my body I was in the light filled rating room and then I wasn't and I was fully in my body and it that was it it was kind of Blackness and pain I think and so it then was a waiting game um they the doctor came in and said you know we brought her here for brain surgery but after seeing the MRI the brain surgery is not going to help her the damage is too extensive we could maybe go in and take the blood clot from the the small stroke but there's a huge  chance like 70 plus percent chance that doing that will cause a stroke on the other side of our brain and she'll die anyways and miraculously I didn't die in that first 24 hours so they moved me from the ICU so over the next couple of days and and the neurologists and the doctors all said you know like this is her this this is going to be her life she's going to need Continuous Care I had a catheter I couldn't eat I was being fed through my nose down a tube and it was horrible I couldn't walk I  couldn't go to the bathroom I couldn't you know turn over to get not not get bed sores and they they were very realistic that you know I'll probably be in the hospital for a long time try to get some rehab or move me to to a rehab facility to try to get something but more than likely this is going to be her forever and then hour after hour I started stalking them and on I think December 27th I walked for the first time walked to the bathroom going to the other side I would like to say that that  was the most exciting time in my life because I've never felt more peaceful or more wonderful or more grounded or more belonging I just want to let people know that we get to choose we get to choose what we learn and we come here to learn on the other side everything is love there is nothing else so you know I there in my view and what I've seen there's no hell there's no punishment there's no judgment so the only thing that happens there is love we come here to experience everything else so the reason we're here is to learn  your human self doesn't choose that's chosen before you come here and we get to choose exactly how we learn and how we experience Our Lives the learning and where we focus that learning is what makes us move forward so it's not punishment it's not you know God or your guides on the other side saying oh hi here you go have this you suck have fun trying to walk through that no it's your guides and God and everyone you love saying we know you are strong enough to walk through this life we're gonna walk beside you as you learn these  lessons if you ignore the lessons they'll keep throwing them at you so try to focus on what the lessons are that's why we're here we are here to learn [Music] 
A235	https://youtu.be/g_F_MFX0pUg?si=YhZmNgKD6v0v-eP0	I'm going to share with you my weight loss Journey what I have done not only in a time of crisis when I was really packing on weight but I also want to talk about some of the tools I use on a regular basis to stay the weight that that feels comfortable to me I help you all know weight loss is a personal Journey now we always want you to be metabolically healthy want your blood work to be great but the goal of our weight should not be to all of us to fit into a size four our goal of our weight should be we love living in our body and  metabolically we are healthy end a story so in this video I want to talk about how I lost 25 pounds and how over time I what tools I have personally leaned into so let's dive in and I and I hope you find this helpful so first um exercise what's really interesting is that the old theory of weight loss and I know those of you that have been following me for a while you you hopefully you know have heard me say this but if you're new to my my teachings um it's really important that we gather this or that  you understand this is that the old theory of weight loss was eat less exercise more now if we stop and we think about that for a moment how'd that work for us as a society I know we're a worldwide audience but like really like how did that work for us um we're more obese than ever before so it's not working for us in case you you could didn't know that so we've got to re-evaluate those two things okay so if we exercise and the problem it's not working for us just really clearly is that if you exercise more and  you eat less you create a new set point in your body that your body says okay I need to stay at this set point in order to be this weight so it's like calorie there's a calorie Delta from the output to the input and that Delta has to Ma has to be the same every single day okay well what happens when it's Christmas or a holiday that you celebrate or in in the US we Thanksgiving it's coming up soon so what happens when you gorge on that now all of a sudden your calories go up well we've all experienced that we  start to gain weight uh what happens when you injure yourself or you got really busy and you stopped being able to exercise well many of us have experienced that we start to gain weight so we need to dip into some of the things that I'm about to show you and if I was to take EX exercise and food and if you asked me which one was more important for weight loss hands down I would tell you food now and everything about food not just how we eat food the type of food we eat the macronutrients but the timing of food all of that  matters more than exercise now I will tell you I'm not giving you a free pass to not exercise I believe we should all be gaining muscle I believe we all should be walking like I believe exercise really helps with with our cognitive capabilities but if for this video if we're trying to lose weight we want to lean more into food so the first part of that is timing of food I have shared this story and it's so it's such a powerful story I want to share it again if you haven't heard it and if you have stick with me because I got some  good information at the end of this video um a man and and he's been he's he's allowed me to talk brag about him um his name is Todd he came to me and he was over 300 lb and he had tried every diet in the in in the book and he had a food addiction and uh he asked for my help knowing he had a food addiction he was drinking a lot of soda eating a lot of bad food I didn't start with changing his food I started with the timing of his food and I had him eat all of that toxic food that inflammatory insulin  resistant creating food in one eating window we got his eating window down to 15 or his uh eating window down yeah to eight hours and so eight nine hours so he was fasting about 15 16 hours he didn't change anything he ate and what ended up happening was month by month the the weight started falling off so that was over a year ago TD is down 150 lbs just by changing when he ate not what he ate so that's how powerful fasting comp beets now if you don't believe me um I can tell you some studies and I'm going to leave the links  here the notes so a 2023 review now the thing to know about reviews is reviews look at a lot of studies they're like meta analysis and this one looked at 27 fasting studies and in every single one and there were lots of ways it looked at fasting and every single one of these studies evaluated people lost significant amount amounts of weight just by taking their food and compressing it into one eating window leaving a longer period for fasting so and it the weight loss varied um again I will leave that study in there but  there's no question there's no question if you don't want to exercise just start fasting do time restricted eating those of you that have been listening to me forever put it in there how much weight have you lost it blows my mind when I see hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of pounds since I've been here on YouTube talking about fasting that people have lost week it is unreal and it is free and is simple and all you got to do is train your body to do it this is why this channel has grown so big  this is why this book has done so well because fasting Works end of story okay number two the keto diet okay the keto diet let's unpack this one and before you protein hounds are like well the keto diet is too low in in protein I'm going to make some modifications as I go through this so here's what we need to know about the keto diet the reason that the keto diet helps you lose weight without exercising is because what ends up happening is you are bringing your blood sugar down whenever we eat a carbohydrate that's  lacking fiber so like a bread piece of bread our blood sugar spikes really high and so now that blood sugar is got to come down and it's got to get down long enough and far enough to switch over into fat burning mode but when we're on the keto diet and we eat our blood sugar doesn't Spike as high so guess what all the numbers that I put in here the 13 hour 17 hour 24 hours that it takes in a fasten state to get these incredible results people who do the keto diet the the speculation is that they get over  there quicker because the blood sugar isn't as high it doesn't have to come down as much so they can get over into the fat burning Place much easier so the keto diet is incredible now those of you who don't believe me let me give you a study a 2021 study found that people on the keto diet had less gin okay gin is your hunger hormone so taking that refined carbohydrate out of your out of your body all of a sudden now your blood sugar doesn't Spike as much and your hunger kicks off okay that's really  helpful for losing weight but it also helped with feeling full so it didn't just kick off the hunger hor hormone but it also stimulated a feeling of fullness and that translated in obviously to more weight loss so pretty cool diet now for women please note if you're new to my channel I wrote a whole book on why we don't keto all all month long and if you're menopausal we don't keto all all week long so put it in here you can dive in and and and read all about it okay next one new favorite I'm going to keep  talking about this protein so of we have three macronutrients we have fat we have carbs and we have protein of the three macronutrients which one do you think kills hunger the most I'm let you think about that for a moment you might have said fat but that's not the answer the answer is protein protein is the most filling of all the macronutrients you don't believe me I'm Gonna Leave a study here for you so the other thing we know about protein is it increases thermogenesis okay well what's that  thermogenesis is your body heat it brings up your body heat which is AKA your metabolism so those of you that are like I think my metabolism is too slow really what you're saying is I'm not creating enough thermogenesis in my body and that's not necessarily a function of your unique body I can't tell you how many times I sat with patients that would say to me like I think my I think my have a thyroid problem my metabolism is slow yes that can be a thing for but not it's not the most common thing the  most common thing is you're not eating the right macro nutrients so you're not elevating that thermogenesis which means you're not raising your metabolism and that macronutrient is protein and hopefully you all know that I support the idea that one gram of protein for every every pound of body weight I know we don't we're a worldwide audience and so we'll have to do some translation into kilograms but one pound one gram for every pound of body weight will help you that's how much you should have  every single day now the research shows that not only is it the most filling macro macronutrient that a high protein diet is one of the best diets for weight loss okay so let's let's just take a like a a big picture view right now what have we all been doing to lose weight for the last several decades we've been counting calories we've been exercising all the time um we have been we've been going low fat which is only going to increase hunger and we have been villainizing the carbohydrate we're like  all on the bad carbo carb and we know the keto diet helps but the poor little proteins been like sitting over here like hey hey guys I'm the MVP of the weight loss game I'm over here pretty soon all the attention's going to come over here and you're going to see that I am your most powerful macronutrient to be able to help you lose weight so make sure you're eating enough protein a gram of protein for every pound of body weight that you want to be your ideal body weight okay next one and don't worry my story of weight loss is coming  here in a moment I'm going to tie this all together so the next one is fiber so this is really interesting I want you to like just walk through this with me for a second so fiber stabilizes blood sugar so this is when we are looking in the ketogenic diet or I wrote in both fast like a girl and the menopause reset I wrote about net carbs what's a net carb a net carb is a total carb minus the fiber and that's how you get the net carb well why would that be important that's important because fiber helps  prevent a high blood sugar Spike so when we are eating a potato potato is going to have a little more fiber than a potato chip so we want to have this fiber in our food so that it's it's like it's a little bit acts a little bit like fat where it puts a break on this really high blood sugar plus fiber feeds your microbiome which remember your microbiome helps with your with feeding the you know with stabilizing blood sugar and there's certain microbes by the way in your gut that send a signal to the liver that say  hey we just brought the blood sugar down go ahead and switch over to ketosis let's start burning fat and those microbes that are doing that job for you they want fiber so let's make sure we're eating enough fiber there's a really interesting study on fiber a 2001 study so a little bit old that found that overweight people ate 18% less food and lost significantly more weight when they had a high fiber diet now I want to stop here for a minute because I know we've got plant-based people and I know we  have animal-based people and at this moment I just said protein and I just said fiber and that might look conflicting so first my general stance on diet is you do you what's working for you just don't do the Western diet that's the only thing I'm telling you not to do so is there a possib ability that in your diet there exists high protein and there's some very high protein plants like did you know broccoli is really high in protein so you're getting the fiber and you're getting the protein so is there a world  where you could increase protein and increase fiber now if you're plant-based let's just make sure that you are putting in those higher protein vegetables and you're getting to that one gram of protein per pound of body weight if you are in the animal eating world then let's just make sure you didn't get so excited about protein that you forgot to eat fiber so let's make sure we're bringing both of those in it's just thinking for yourself when you look at those two things together deal okay check this out I have a free fasting  guide for you all it's free and it's going to teach you all the basics of fasting it's going to teach you how to kill hunger when you fast which is really cool and it's going to show you how to break your fast among many other things things all you got to do is click on this link right here and enjoy okay last one okay no actually I got a Bonus tip after this last one is Whole Foods if we just get processed foods out of the diet like literally I'm just going to be really bold as to say if we could  close every fast food restaurant on this planet we would reverse metabolic disease if we could take away the middle aisle of the grocery store and get rid of it and keep you all around the perimeter of the aisle where the fresh food exists we would overturn the metabolic mess we are all in so we've got to get back to Whole Food processed foods are killing us so processed foods of the sugars and the grains and the unhealthy fats hopefully you all know that and a whole food is the original food an apple is a great example it's  perfect an apple a day keeps the doctor away there has never been a more true statement that has continued on for years I've been saying that since the 70s when I was born so we uh we want to go back to the Whole Foods and when I told you that I would tell you my story I was raised in a family with a mom who knew nutrition really well she taught me at a young age how to uh read a nutrition label I'm so great for that she taught me all throughout my whole whole childhood that what you ate mattered  and then of course what did I do when I became a teenager I I rebelled against that I went completely the other way so in my teenage years and into my college Years I was a fast junkie yep yep I said it I don't know if I ever said that publicly like that but literally fast foods I was like mom wouldn't let me go to McDonald's when I was 10 so I'm going now that I can drive at 6 and I started eating a ton of fast food and I gained a bunch of weight and I did didn't know at that time I never made that correlation but the thing that  took the weight off the 25 lbs was just something as simple as coming back to Whole Food I just went back and I was like oh my gosh why don't I go back down my mom taught me to eat and when I did that at 19 20 years old Boom the weight dropped off so just just quality of Food Matters I did an amazing interview with Vonnie Hari the food babe you can go listen to that on my podcast the resetter podcast and I talked we talked about ingredients and she breaks all those ingredients down so go listen to that because Whole  Foods matter and here's the thing about Whole Foods they don't have an ingredient list an apple doesn't have an ingredient list so if you're not sure what a whole food is just just make sure you're they don't have ingredient lists and it came from nature it came from a tree came from the ground those are those are whole fits okay last couple tips and this is my new favorite I'm such a walking fan so I know the title of this of this uh video is without exercise but I'm going to encourage you to walk and um I call it Forward  movement so if you don't like walking if you're a runner and you're like oh walking's really for lazy people that was me when I first started to look into the science of walking I was like really like walking is exercise come on and now I've looked at all the studies and that's what I don't I barely run anymore I walk because it's so good for my joints it's so good for my brain but what we found in studies and Gathering studies for this is that a 2017 study found that moderate daily walking caused  people to lose about a half a pound a week okay I don't know when you're watching this but the holidays are coming what happens during the holidays during the holidays people gain two to three pounds sometimes even more and they don't ever take that off because we're all eating our favorite foods that like make us feel like childhood and they're so make us all warm and fuzzy inside and they tradition okay what if we just put in a moderate daily walk every single day throughout the holidays we could lose a half a pound a week  versus the P people who didn't walk so it even I'mma throw in here as well it even improved cognition this was a 2023 study and that's because walking calms the brain so I can even tell you now what I do I do a lot of my phone calls while I'm walking I I I do a lot of business uh I talk to my team I talk to friends when I'm walking sometimes I'll listen to podcasts when I'm walking so there's a lot to do when you're walking okay and then here's the last thing I want to say on walking is that 5,000  steps is a good way to start it's a start and 10,000 is optimal it's just a good little Target to look at at 10 a 10,000 steps there you go I can't say enough about how simple these are I can't can't say enough about how how inexpensive all of these are we we've over complicated weight loss we don't need to over complicate weight loss and here's what I love about this Channel and what those of you who have listened all the way through through and you've listened to my videos please give me this gift I want to see in the comments  how much weight you've lost fasting it's it's like the favorite thing I get to do every day is come to my channel and see how much weight you all have lost just from watching a free video on YouTube cuz these things work so please give me that Joy give me that dopamine Rush how much weight have you Lo lost building yourself a fasting lifestyle or using any of the of the tools that I just taught you in this video so as always don't give up on yourself you were born in a miracle I'm cheran okay are you fasting and you're  still not losing weight check out this video because you might be missing a key part of your fasting experience that's going to unlock weight loss so if you think about it all the humans that emerged out of that time have the gene that allows us to go without food and that Gene they believe is in all of us today

 fix some of the problems that you're experiencing you are in the right place and we are so glad that you're here on this call we have some of the top experts in the world and I'm not exaggerating on the subject of instant resistance and you're going to be learning a lot about that topic if you're a brand new beginner if that is a word that you're not familiar with or a term you're not familiar with don't worry you're going to become very very familiar with it um we're going to be doing some demonstrations and explaining
 
 a protocol that Flatout works better than anything I've ever tried before now I'm somebody who has struggled with snacking with overeating with um really my entire life with those things um and food in food addiction uh we don't talk enough about the number one most prevalent eating disorder in the world today which is food uh it's well binge eating disorder is what it's called I I call it kind of food addiction and those are are very similar right but that's something my whole life you know um I'm
 
 one of those guys where if I'm not on a diet I am gaining weight and gaining it quickly um until I started this protocol and it has just been awesome for me so I want to share it with you um we're setting up our translation now and so if it sounds like I'm stalling a little bit um I am but I think we're all good if you need translation go ahead and select the Spanish option in the live Zoom we have 167 people already in the zoom right now and hundreds maybe thousands more that are watching this through a
 
 restream so thanks we're not going to take up any more of your time we want to dive in and I'm going to share my screen as we get started here and kind of set the table for tonight's call so um to begin I'll just introduce myself briefly this is me my name's Trent and this is a picture of me and my dad and uh six and a half almost seven years ago my dad died from stage four colon cancer now when they found the cancer in my dad's body it was already everywhere it was in his colon it was in his liver his
 
 lungs all of his lymph noes and uh this is like my best friend and my hero um and when I found out that he got sick I just got desperate I went into a panic trying to study read learn anything that might perhaps save my dying father my dad was the greatest guy in the world but he had the world's worst diet and anytime he would get stressed uh he would turn to food and I have kind of been the same wave for a lot of my life my dad had insulin resistance he was pre-diabetic with high blood pressure high cholesterol he struggled
 
 with weight control and this is actually a pretty good photo of my dad he um he struggled quite a bit with his weight um my dad had sasis all over his body he was on more medications than I can count and um so I started to get desperate and just read everything I could read on the subject of metabolic Health on insulin resistance to try and help my dad and uh I made a commitment when my dad passed away that I would take everything I was learning and try to help other people so tonight this call is for anybody maybe
 
 your dad or your mom or your brother or loved one or friend or somebody you care about is struggling with their metabolic health and I hope that tonight's call will be a great moment um in their life or in your life if you're struggling that may lead you to much better health forever um um there are 200 people on this call and many of them are people I recognize we're going to prove to you that this is an incredible incredible approach uh using some Fiber and using some intermittent fasting to just totally
 
 upgrade metabolic Health now to begin I have a guest on tonight's call now this is a stranger somebody that I've not met before um except for just over the phone and I know she just got off work and so I'm going to bring her onto the phone her name is Ari and Ari um first off welcome to tonight's call thanks I know you've had a busy day and just got off work and are in the parking lot right outside of work and so thank you for being on tonight's call um each week we do a little interview like this at the
 
 beginning of the call with somebody that's newer on the protocol and you're only a few months onto the protocol but I understand that you've had a fantastic experience so far so uh to begin tell us a little bit about yourself who are you where you from and where were you at with your health before you started this protocol uh oh you're on mute let me ask you to unmute go ahead and can you hear me now yep perfect okay uh yeah thank you for having me um it's been a pretty incredible couple of months um my name is Ari I'm
 
 from California um San Jose Bara and uh I started uh I started this when I was um gosh I would I started this when I gave up hope honestly um I was pretty much just letting my life and my health just kind of take its own wheel and and do its own thing because nothing was working and my mom back in December um on December 19th I remember the day distinctly she was like you know I've heard about this thing just give it a shot you know it includes fasting which honestly I kind of was you know familiar
 
 with it didn't seem like you know something I was too interested in you know I was like yeah it sounds like one of those things that the fads that people in La do and then she's like yeah but you know you have like this unim mate and fiber and you have it before you eat and I was like ah it just sounds like a lot of work and it sounds like a scam and she's like no I promise just do it with me I want someone to do it with me give it a shot just just trust me I would never try and suggest something
 
 that I didn't want to try myself so I was like all right Mom I love you I I'll do it with you and she had been doing it for about almost a month at that point and she was already kind of feeling a little different you know and and of course the way she monitors herself is different from me you know and lo and behold I had not told my mom that I was pre-diabetic I had not told anybody that I was pre-diabetic my doctors were telling me like hey we need to start considering medicine for you and I was
 
 so ashamed I just gave up I was like no I'm going to pretend this doesn't exist this isn't real and maybe you know I'll get away from it somehow and you know I kind of put some Blind Faith in it when I started and then within a month and a half I went from pre-diabetic to just back in the green with my blood work and I couldn't believe it I was so convinced that my mom had got me onto some like you know diet fad that you know was like um oh what is what is it they're Slim Fast and things like that
 
 and I was like no way and then but then it wasn't even just my blood work I mean my glucose and everything was incredible but my clothes were fitting different and I was starting to lose weight and inches and on top of that um I have not officially weighed myself since about like maybe three three weeks ago because I'm kind of trying to make it till the end of this month until I finally weigh myself again but since December I have lost 40 pounds officially and I can't believe it like nothing has worked like this I've been
 
 on keto I've been on you know multiple kinds of different um diets and this that's the thing that's the thing I don't even like calling this a diet because it doesn't feel like it I can still participate in life with my family going out and having dinner with my friends I'm not restricting myself I'm enjoying just doing things normally with an added you know help from the tea and the fiber and the fasting it doesn't feel like my life is obstructed and that's the most amazing part of it I'm getting healthy while living my life and
 
 that's what I love about it of course now I'm on mute all right I'm so happy for you I really really appreciate you coming on and sharing your story I know it's been a busy day I'm gonna I'm gonna share my screen and just kind of show a couple of pictures that were sent to me uh from you I believe or from from perhaps somebody else maybe your mom um yeah but your mom also her A1C has dropped and she's doing great and I saw before and after picture of her which was incredible and so uh you guys are kind of doing it together
 
 but everyone uh this is a before picture of Ari and she is now down uh from this time she's down 40 plus pounds and uh Ari mentioned earlier today here's the after that she never is able to put herself in white pants because she doesn't like the way she looks in white pants but now is loving the way she looks in white pants and I thought that was so cool Ari and I'm happy for you but but the most important thing is that blood work I mean yeah the fact that your blood work is improving and that your doctors
 
 are saying that your pre-diabetes is gone is just such a huge accomplishment so hey we're happy for you the best is yet to come one thing about this protocol is as you continue using it consistently I found that the results are often very Progressive so thank you for sharing your story anything you'd like to say before you sign off to somebody that may be skeptical like you were or just anything at all you'd like to end with yeah no I mean uh just kind of a leaving on a Sentimental note is um you know I specifically to my mom you
 
 know I had told her from the Beet go that I was like Mom I don't believe in this you know I I'm just going to do it because I love you and then in the end maybe sometime last month when you know her me my girlfriend my brother all of us are having amazing results on this um I told her I said Mom and I was really emotional I was like I feel like I get to keep you longer because you're on this system I was always preparing myself for when my mom would eventually you know have some sort of Health complications because of her diabetes or
 
 her high blood pressure or something of that nature and seeing all the improvements that she's having and you know the weight she's dropping but just overall her health and how I can just tell she's going to be getting off her medication at some point I'm like I get my mom I get to keep my mom longer and that is a wonderful feeling and if there's anyone in your life that you know not just you you're thinking of you and maybe your kids or you're thinking of you and you're thinking of you know your parents that is such a wonderful
 
 thing and I think that's very touching for you yourself especially your personal testimony you know because you went in search of this because of your father right and I feel like there's so many people who would really relate to that sentiment so you know really give it a Ari thank you so much um you you are so awesome and we're excited for you and we're grateful to you for coming on and sharing your story thanks for being on our call guys if you haven't read the chat yet Ari go look at the chat there's 230 people here on the
 
 live Zoom hundreds maybe thousands more watching this through restreams and so uh you're getting a ton of love so go check out the chat everybody loves you and uh we're so happy for you Ari thanks for being our guest tonight thank you okay um so happy for Ari and we want to explain exactly how this protocol works and make it super super simple this is something that anybody can do and one of the best things about this protocol is it's not something you have to apply for or you know um it anybody can do it it's
 
 completely cost neutral uh one of the best things about fasting is it's completely free right you actually save money as you fast and so we'll we'll carefully explain the whole protocol uh as part of tonight call we're also going to have a live coaching Q&A session where you will be able to ask questions from experts who are so Savvy in metabolic health and we'll be able to help with with a number of different things for our guests tonight people that are on the live call but first I want to turn the time over to our real
 
 special guest for tonight um this is Lindsay vent now if you're not familiar with Lindsay Lindsay is one of the founding members for the metabolic Society for healthcare practitioners Lindsay is somebody that wakes up in the morning every day puts on her superhero cape and spends all of her days um helping people that are sick people that are diabetic pre-diabetic uh people with thyroid problems people with obesity problems you name the problem uh when it comes to metabolic Health Lindsay tackles those problems and fixes those
 
 problems for clients all over the country um she has been worked hand inand with some of the biggest names in the scientific space when it comes to insulin and insulin resistance and Lindsay is truly an expert we are honored to have her on the call tonight she's going to be talking all about insulin resistance so this is an opportunity to learn from one of the best I'm going to turn the time over to Lindsay Lindsay go ahead awesome thank you so much I'm G to share my screen so you guys can get the visuals that I have
 
 prepared so I'm excited to do this thanks Trent for the wonderful um introduction oops let me make technology work like it's supposed to so as those of you who have seen me before talk it's really important in my opinion for you to understand why what is insulin resistance and why are we saying that what we're asking you to do is going to be helpful and so starting out here this is how you reach me you can go to ven integrative medicine or insulin IQ I am happy to help um either place so first of all do you even need to worry if you
 
 have insulin resistance or not well we're going to show you here in a minute that is significant majority of people do actually have insulin resistance if you wonder these are the signs and symptoms to look for insulin's a growth hormone it makes things grow including fat but here's an example skin tags excessive growth of skin a kenosis nigricans is excessive skin pigmentation excessive belly fat that we see all the time these dad bods that are showing up excessive fatigue if you can't understand why you are so tired all the
 
 time this is a major sign of insulin resistance and then lastly this insatiable hunger you're hunger hungry an hour after you eat why is that well it's because of insulin resistance so what is insulin resistance how do I make this make sense for you this picture in the bottom is a picture of a cell every single cell in the body requires insulin and that's why we have so many symptoms associated with insulin resistance and so the way it works the cell has a receptor for insulin that you can see here and it has a doorway for glucose
 
 that you can see see over here insulin very much works like a key and a lock if you are trying to open the door that's locked you need the key in order to get in same thing works with insulin and glucose if your key does not work or if your lock does not work which is what insulin resistance is then this mechanism goes away and glucose cannot get in so what does the body do with it well a normal person eats something and their glucose will go up their insulin will go up and everything comes down
 
 nice and normal someone with insulin resistance their glucose has the same rise but their insulin has to way over respond in order to get glucose to come down and oftentimes that coming down is a significant response and we have hypoglycemia which leads to excessive hunger and Cravings as well and so that's where those signs and symptoms of insulin resistance come from and so we want to improve insulin sensitivity are the words I'm going to use as we move forward with our interventions so another way to look at
 
 this when we make lots of lots and lots of insulin like I just showed with that curve we have over storage of glucose we store glucose and places we're not supposed to store glucose places like our muscle places like our fat we're not supposed to do that those things liver is not designed to store glucose where else this becomes a problem is how we store the fat fat storage hypertrophy is about 95% of us there's a large portion of us that are hypertrophic fat stores these are people people that have a
 
 limited capacity to store fat they can only get so fat and then they stop getting fat because those fat cells can only get so much bigger and bigger and bigger hyperplasia is an increase in the number of fat cells this is actually a little bit healthier though you can become these 600 PB life people because you are storing more and more and more tiny little healthy fat cells versus again going back to being the um limited fat storage person who is extremely inflammatory so we we don't want to do
 
 this and it's all from too much insulin how prevalent is it why do you have to worry well this study in 2019 showed that there's only 12% of us that don't have it another study that was more recent that just came out shows there's only 7% of us that don't have it that means 93% of Americans have some form whether it be mild or severe of insulin resistance why does it matter I keep adding to this slide I stole this from my friend Ben bigman and I keep adding to it all of these things floating around this insulin resistance
 
 Circle I call them symptoms they're symptoms of an underlying root cause of an underlying disorder known as insulin resistance so if we can improve the root cause we can improve the symptoms which we are also often calling them diseases with one or two maybe interventions so I'm going to talk really quickly about um a few of the major diseases or symptoms that we that we look at here type 2 diabetes is certainly the most prevalent this is classified with an A1C greater than or equal to 6.5 your goal is to be less
 
 than 5.5 I really recommend if you're not sure grab a fasting insulin you want this number to be less than six if you are above six no matter what that reference range tells you if you are above six then you are likely insulin resistant um despite what your doctor May tell you this A1C number I always like to point out because an A1C of 6.5 down here that's diabetic actually if you look at the number it's average blood sugar of 154 that's quite high but non-diabetic is only an average blood sugar of 151 it's really kind of an
 
 arbitrary number and that's why this insulin number is so much more important in my opinion especially early on hypertension or high blood pressure this is another one this comes from Ben's book there's a couple of ways that high insulin leads to high blood pressure the number one reason is increas in volume your bloodstream is a closed system just like a hose that has you know an opening and a closing if you have a closed system and then you increase volume which we do with excess aldosterone from excess insulin then
 
 you're going to increase pressure we also have the issue with constriction or inability to dilate that comes from both nitric oxide as well as um vessel W vessel wall hypertrophy and narrowing so two reasons both caused by insulin can be improved by insulin um lead to high blood pressure coronary artery disease or issues with high cholesterol is another one that we look at very frequently most of you know that we've all been told back in the day that if you eat saturated fat or if you eat cholesterol that it's just like pouring
 
 grease down a cold pipe is going to clog your arteries well 100% not true that theory is completely gone what we do know is inflammation associated with what we call dyslipidemia or a really poor or triglyceride to HDL ratio is actually the true cause so you want to take your triglyceride and your HDL this happens in a normal lipid panel that you get at your annual exam take your triglyceride and divide it by your HDL and Canada multiply by 2.3 and then you can figure out what your ratio is so these are my numbers 84 divided by 83 is
 
 about one like Trent said I do this all day long every day really common numbers and actually considered normal for a triglyceride for example is 150 and an HDL for example is 50 for them that person their ratio is going to be 3.0 well to be a rock star you want to be 1.0 or less to be not insulin resistant you want to be less than 1.5 if you are above 1.5 you need to get going and improving your insulin resistance Alzheimer's disease or type 3 diabetes and this actually includes all kinds of dementia not just
 
 Alzheimer's um this is caused by insulin resistance of the brain the brain is a very very picky thing it really only likes two fuel sources fuel source number one would be glucose fuel source number two would be ketones we know that insulin resistance prevents glucose from getting into the cell including the brain cells so if you have insulin resistance of the brain you can't use glucose you can take this one off of your list of things that you can use for fuel well if you don't intermit and fast or if you don't follow a
 
 ketogenic style of eating you also don't make ketones so that one comes off of the fuel source so therefore we get brain dysfunction cognitive dysfunction so we want to improve this by improving the insulin resistance and finding some time to make some ketones with some intermittent fasting fatty liver this nld stands for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease this has become a major problem we know that it's the number one cause of hospitalization related to liver disease out this surpasses alcoholic fatty liver
 
 it surpasses Heep um has become really really common it's a very big problem um the worst part about it is most people don't know they have it it is not easy to measure on lab um the A and ALT that you'll see on your lab results do not become elevated until your fatty liver disease is quite severe fertility I deal with a lot of fertility patients so the number one cause of fertility in women is PCOS you you can see a lot of the symptoms here are similar to the symptoms of insulin resistance because they go hand inand
 
 what happens is is when we have high levels of insulin we are unable to use an enzyme called aromatase that leads to inability to convert testosterone to estrogen and that's what leads to the facial hair the weight gain the acne things like that in women with PCOS but it also leads to the inability to ovulate um so that's where these polycystic these we call it the String of Pearls when you look at it on ultrasound that's where that develops because if you can't ovulate those cyst will continue to develop and never be
 
 released next low testosterone and Ed um there is lots and lots of information on the um inverse relationship between insulin and testosterone the higher the insulin the lower the testosterone I've seen this hundreds of times in men looking at lab results so if we get insulin down testosterone goes up this helps obviously with sperm produ tion if testosterone is low we don't produce enough sperm the other factor is just like in blood pressure if we don't vasodilate we are unable to have normal erectile function and Ed
 
 ensues next I did a whole bunch of extra slides for this and I kind of rushed through the other because I really wanted to get into gp1 this is a you know hot button topic anymore all of these drugs OIC woi mararo Etc known as gp1s I want to talk about what these are and why they are good and why they are not so good depending on how you're getting them go1 is an incron hormone meaning that we make it in our incron system or our GI tract the benefits as you can see here are multifold they don't just impact our you know our
 
 stomach or our appetite centers though they do impact those they impact our kidneys and our liver and our fat tisue and all of these things and so you can see over here it's going to suppress appetite improve satiety improve polyus which is fat burning so you're going to burn more fat muscle efficiency means you're going to get more out of your workout you're going to lower inflammation increase in brown fat leads to increase in energy production paric particularly heat which means you're going to be wasting calories but able to
 
 also generate more heat which is good for the body and also decrease glucagon which can be confusing to some people but for patients who have high blood sugars that we cannot explain it's a very good possibility it's related to excess gluc gone so bringing this down is very helpful in reversing diabetes so where can we get some glp1 in a place that we like well we certainly like UNAM mate it's a wonderful place to get glp1 benefits our friend my friend at insulin IQ Ben bman actually just recently did a study
 
 specifically on the product from Unicity um and he had some really great findings that he presented in March but there was one that he didn't present that I want to share with you now but I'm going to let you hear from him Lindsay we don't have audio so let me uh have you pause it and if you click on your share and there should be an option there to share audio okay thank you yeah share audio go to more more go to your share and then go to more and then there 's a little thing that says share sound or
 
 share audio if you can't find it you can just maybe paraphrase what Ben says okay I don't think I'm GNA be able to I don't see it I don't have my share on here anymore I just have pause so okay well we're I will paraphrase he pretty much says here and if anybody wants a copy of this video I will send it to you that in his studies that he has not published or else I would have shared the actual published results um that they found in increase in glp1 from unamate by 70% so huge huge number so let's see here make that go
 
 away okay so what is this I'm just really quickly because I don't want everything that I say gonna be coming from Ben Vickman yerbamate is obviously what unimate is made out of and so it consists of all these wonderful things a little caffeine theobromine phenolic acids Etc the phenolic acid has this thing in it called chlorogenic acid and and that's the one that helps with the glp1 benefit we know it's insulin sensitizing and we know it stimulates glp1 production stepping away from Ben there are study after study after study
 
 that I went out there and found that do show Improvement in body weight waste um circumference obesity blood pressure glucose insulin cholesterol Etc so it's not just the unimate but remember the unamate is a concentrate of this so it's even better that helps with what we're looking at briefly I want to talk about the gp1 agonists and so these are synthetic glp1 this is not your body's natural production of gp1 which is what unamate is this is a synthetic glp1 that we're injecting into the body and the problem
 
 here is that we are actually achieving Supernatural levels of glp1 by doing this and what's the problem with that well all of those things I mentioned earlier were getting in Mass amounts we're getting gastroparesis you can see here you know I talked about delayed gastric emptying well a slight delay is not a problem but you get severe delay with Supernatural levels you can have significant problems nausea and vomiting constipation we know there's blackbox warning out here on these for thyroid cancer the big ones that I think are the
 
 most important and when I talk to my patients when you have significant rapid weight loss that is unhealthy because of its kind of a starvation mode kind of dieting that we're doing with these drugs you lose muscle and you lose bone and what I tell to people is do you really want to trade your love handles for osteoporosis and sarcopenia my answer would be no because you don't gain those things back unless you're a young buck who can continue to lift weights and do things like that I did put in here all of these different drugs
 
 over here the most popular is obviously OIC the one that you hear the most um OIC and wovi are the same thing um oh it's not even on here Zep bound is another one that's the same thing as monjaro those ones are the new ones that are the super super high doses these other ones are a little bit lower dose and some people actually need them we certainly don't want to shame anybody who's on these drugs and need these drugs but we really want to be aware of how do we boost this naturally maybe instead in order to eliminate negative
 
 side effects but yet do something that's that's good for the body so if you have questions if you want more information on this please reach out my email here for both places um I'm always happy to help and I hope I hope you guys got something out of this call tonight I I certainly did and I you know I know this stuff pretty well but I learned a lot especially about the glp1 stuff so thanks so much Lindsay and we're gonna bring Lindsay back for the Q&A here in a moment and by the way if anybody's watching this who does not
 
 have a physician that you're working with maybe you don't have blood work maybe you're scared to get blood work um maybe you don't know how to interpret your blood work um I would just refer you to Lindsay she is an absolute Pro and hero is to help people get their problem solved naturally without drugs whenever possible and she is a fantastic fantastic person to work with so okay I'm gonna share my screen and I want to explain the protocol um perhaps as I do that my goal is I'm I'm going to just
 
 pretend that every single person listening to this has no idea what this protocol is how it works and you are all here for the very very first time um and so I'm just going to kind of set the table and explain exactly what we are doing with this protocol after I do that we will I'm GNA do a demonstration and and uh kind of do a little experiment and then I want to give you some proof you know it's important for anybody that's watching this that may be skeptical or unsure that you get some proof
 
 because that that's belief building and convincing right and then we'll have a live Q&A so here we go everybody in the world is familiar with white rice right but what most people don't know is that wild rice actually looks like this over here so around every single grain of rice is something called the bran which is the fiber part of the plant but food makers actually remove the brand and for the most part we only eat the white part this is what wheat looks like and in nature wheat has lots and lots of
 
 fiber but food makers take out all the fiber so that they can make processed foods like white bread every sugar every carbohydrate in nature without an exception comes packaged in fiber whether you believe in God or or Mother Nature or Evolution um regardless we all have to agree that anytime in nature sugar appears it always comes together with fiber so for example this apple is most sugar and water but this sugar and water is packaged in fiber and the fiber is very important okay if you remove the fiber let's say
 
 you juice the Apple you're left with just the sugar water right and somebody that struggles with weight control or blood sugar control somebody you know Ari mentioned she was pre-diabetic and she's now no longer a pre-diabetic after just a couple months on the protocol if somebody strugg with blood sugar control with insulin resistance if somebody struggles with weight control or appetite control is a big one if you eat an apple no problem but if you take the same Apple matter of fact it would take
 
 three of them it would take three large apples to create one cup of apple juice if you drink the Apple now you've got a problem your blood sugar goes crazy you get brain fog you feel even more hungry and you can't figure out what is going on and the difference is the fiber okay so everybody go with me here let's say there was a a contest uh a pizza eating contest all right and you know there was a million dollars on the line and if you could eat more pizza than your neighbors and friends you get the million dollars
 
 right however going into the contest the rule is that you have an option option number one is before starting the pizza eating contest you either have to eat three large apples and then start the pizza contest or you can drink one cup one little cup of apple juice and then you can eat the pizza what would you choose what would everybody else choose well of course it would be much better if your goal is to eat as much as possible to just drink this apple juice because I mean if you eat the three apples you won't even
 
 finish the third Apple you'll be so full that's because apples are very satiating and the satiation all comes from the fiber okay even sugar itself in nature comes packaged in fiber now food makers over the last 50 years have been doing one thing I mean they've been doing a lot of things but one of the main things they've been doing is they have been removing fiber from the food supply why on Earth are they doing this H why would they want to remove fiber from all of our food well let's look first at some
 
 facts okay health benefits of fiber if you have diabetes or pre-diabetes fiber is your friend because it's what what helps with blood sugar control and weight management fiber can lower your risk of heart disease and some cancer what's the number one killer in the world it is heart disease what's the number two killer in the world cancer why are they taking fiber out of everything if that's what protects us from heart disease and cancer fiber is specifically what helps us control our blood sugar it is specifically what
 
 helps control blood sugar spikes and Insulin spikes more on that in second fiber is what protects our heart it prevents our body fiber prevents your body from taking in some fat and cholesterol sounds pretty good it's what lowers triglyceride and cholesterol levels fiber is what maintains Digestive Health it improves gut health dramatically and because of the missing fiber because it's being removed from everything we have an gut health epidemic an irritable bowel syndrome and a mental health epidemic and fiber is
 
 what keeps you feeling full and helps with weight management aha maybe this is one of the reasons why the food makers want to take fiber out of food because when fiber is missing we can eat and eat and eat and never feel full when you drink the apples you don't get full it is basically just sugar water and most of our food nowadays most processed food is sugar water it's just pure sugar pure glucose pure carbohydrate no fiber so when you do this over the course of 50 years to an entire population if you slowly remove
 
 fiber from the food supply you're going to end up with a nation full of these problems and sure enough right now one out of three in the United States is either pre-diabetic or type two diabetic heart disease the number one killer in the world one out of five has irritable bowel syndrome and when you have IBS you almost always get anxiety or depression and 2/3 of adults are overweight taking the fiber out wasn't such a good idea but there's a silver lining there is a silver lining and let's do a little demonstration of
 
 Silver Lining here in my hand I have a packet of pure soluble fiber this is a blend of different fibers from different plants and this is what has been removed from the modern diet and because this has been removed from the modern diet we're all getting sick we're all becoming fat and we're all getting diabetes not just in the United States even in Asia right now 50% of Chinese adults in China are insulin resistant pre-diabetic when you take fiber and you consume it in your diet let's say that you have lots of fresh veggies uh fresh
 
 fruits whole fruits whole veggies seeds herbs plants when you have that in your diet the Fiber goes into your stomach and it creates a gel so when you have a garden salad with all those fresh veggies and herbs and seeds you actually get a gel that creates a lining in your gut all right and I'm going to prove it here okay so when you take fiber and you mix it with water at first it's very liquid I mean it's about the same consistency as that of orange juice but I'm going to let this sit for just a few
 
 minutes while I continue explaining this and we're going to come back to this and I'm going to show you something that should make your jaw drop okay because this is being removed from our diet now there was a science company uh in the United States uh formerly you guys may be familiar with the the name rexa drugs you remember the old rexa drug stores so rexa came out with a blend of plant fiber back in the 90s that they said was going to change the world all right and sure enough uh let me share my screen here sure enough
 
 this has now been studied and the reile guys were right if you have the right types of fiber before your meal and this has been proven in uh clinical studies now if you have the right types of fiber before your meals your blood sugar does not Spike nor does your insulin this is something of critical importance to anybody that struggles with weight control blood sugar control or any related condition for women if you have PCOS for men erectile dysfunction Lindsay talked about fatty liver she talked about all the associated problems
 
 if you can control blood sugar it all gets easier and we can do that with fiber but what's more is we have doctors now Jason fun for example who are reversing obesity type 2 diabetes pre-diabetes and lots of related conditions every single day reversing it not treating it reversing it it is gone the people don't have type two diabetes anymore now he has written about how to prevent and reverse these things naturally and for the most part has been laughed at by the medical community because it doesn't fit their narrative I
 
 mean you know they want us to believe that these are chronic problems that we're all going to have for the rest of our lives I mean do you believe that for a second I hope not because in Jason Fun's clinic at the University of Toronto most of the patients with type 2 diabetes have a complete reversal of the disease and are off all medications in three to six months well how does he do it how is that possible I thought type two diabetes and pre-diabetes were irreversible he is doing it for free using intermittent
 
 fasting what Fung figured out is when we started eating and snacking all the time we started bathing our body in blood sugar spikes and insulin and when you have too much insulin your body doesn't function properly Lindsay just gave one of the best explanations of insulin resistance I've ever seen so if we know that with some intermittent fasting we can fix problems like obesity and and diabetes and if we also know that fiber makes all of this much much easier and speeds up the results what we're interested in
 
 doing with this protocol is combining the two let's combine fasting with fiber and that is what this protocol is all about we are combining some intermittent fasting with fiber all right now I want to explain how this works and then I'll get back to my demonstration so most of us that are following this protocol and if you have not started this protocol buckle up you are going to absolutely love this all right it's called feel great because one of the first things you notice is that you'll notice is that you feel fantastic
 
 I mean I feel younger I feel sharper I feel more productive I feel faster I feel lighter on my feet I mean I just feel wonderful okay and that's why it's called feel great so here's how it works if this is breakfast and this is lunch and this is dinner what most of us are doing is we are skipping a meal each day and for most people the easiest meal to skip is breakfast okay now when we skip breakfast we are extending our overnight fast right we had dinner then we went to sleep and we were fasting while we were
 
 sleeping and now it's time for breakfast and instead of eating uh you know Egg McMuffin or getting a Starbucks or whatever instead of burning that for fuel we want to burn our fat or fuel we want to eat our love handles for breakfast now contrary to popular opinion when we are fasting we are actually not starving we are not starving our body is still getting calories where are those calories coming from they're coming from our love hands this is coming from fat the body stores fat in the first place to use it as an
 
 energy source a fuel source when we're fasting so we're going to skip breakfast now when you skip breakfast you save five bucks on what you were going to buy for breakfast right and so what we've done with this protocol that is so clever and makes it cost neutral and affordable for anyone is we create $5 out of thin air with fasting we skip a meal and we take the money that we save on fasting and we use it to buy some things that will make this easy every diet I've ever tried in the past I failed eventually whether I failed it
 
 after a couple of weeks or a couple of months I would eventually fail and the reason why is because it all boiled down to me my willpower my willpower on some days is really good but if I don't get a good night's sleep if I'm under a bunch of work stress or personal stress my willpower starts to dwindle and I cheat and I've been stuck in this cycle for most of my life where do good do good do good for a little while and then just struggle and spiral out of control and then muster up The Willpower to do
 
 good do good do good for a little while and then spiral and this is the cycle that I was repeating what we're doing with this protocol is we're taking willpower out of the equation we want to make it easier for people that struggle so you know some people can just eat clean and exercise and that they love it right for people like me who struggle with snacking and overeating and dietary discipline and don't jump out of bed to go to the gym every morning like many people do if you struggle with those
 
 things like I do there are some ways to make it easier on those of us okay so the unimate the unimate that Lindsay referenced is used to make fasting easy yamate makes me completely forget about food matter of fact when I'm sipping the yamate I feel like I can pretty much fast forever okay now the unamate you can start your day with it in the morning in place of breakfast some people like it hot others like it cold but I sip it and I have more than one sometimes two to three a day and you sip it
 
 slowly and in addition to making you forget about food it has the chlorogenic acid benefits what are those Lindsay talked about the glp1 component that it increases glp1 by as much as 70% but chlorogenic acid is amazing stuff it plays a role in regulating glucose lipid metabolism improving insulin resistance and reducing the risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases okay it can reduce fasting blood glucose improve glucose tolerance enable weight loss prevent weight gain and improve blood
 
 pressure in hypertensive patients the wide range of potential benefits of chlorogenic acid include its anti-diabetic anti-carcinogenic and anti-inflammatory and anti-obesity impacts simply put this is a natural alternative to many of the drugs that people are taking and I'll I'll just kind of hammer that point home with one study um there is a study done I'm just going to grab a piece of it because I need to stay on track here we got to open up Q&A here in a moment this study was done um where they
 
 looked at chlorogenic acid and they were specifically looking at what it did for people who are insulin resistant or diabetic or pre-diabetic and uh the one of the cool things that they mentioned the study was that chlorogenic acid this is so cool chlorogenic acid is a Noel insulin sensitizer that potentiates insulin action similar to the therapeutic action of Metformin am I saying that by sipping unimate a person can naturally get a many of the benefits that metformin gives without any of the side effects
 
 I'm not saying that the scientists that wrote this paper are saying that right so so we do the the the We Sip the unimate while we're fasting okay the fiber you can have before your heaviest meal each day or if you're fiber junky like me I have it before every meal okay the fiber is something that I believe is going to change the world back to our example the thin orange juice like fiber has now become very thick if you've noticed it coats the plastic on this bottle and I'm going to dump it here into a bowl to just
 
 demonstrate what happens in our stomach or what's supposed to happen in our stomach when we have fiber this cheit represents the processed food diet the modern food diet that we are all eating way too much of okay this is fat and carbohydrate in fact it is processed carbohydrate in fat but when we first have fiber and then we eat the che it or any carbohydrate for that matter any food for that matter it gets coated it gets coated in the fiber it creates a gel around the carbohydrate okay this slows the digestion of the carbohydrate
 
 which helps slow the release of glucose lessening the glucose spike it also helps block some of the fat absorption it helps block some of the cholesterol it is incredible it feeds this a blend of different fibers that feeds all the bacteria living in your gut it is like nothing I've ever had before and when you combine the intermittent fasting with the fiber I'll just show you I mean and I'm gonna ask for some proof here I mean there are 254 people just on our Zoom call right now who knows how many
 
 people uh that have are are watching through the different R streams so I I want to show you some proof but I actually more importantly want to ask you for some proof so let do me a favor whether you have if if you're watching this and you've already started the protocol okay I I I really whether you've been on it for a week or a month or a year if you or somebody in your household has been using this protocol and has noticed a measurable result okay a measurable result positive result if you would just just do me a favor and
 
 put a sentence or two in the chat I want to read some of these okay now I don't want anybody to exaggerate the truth is enough if you've been using it share what you've experienced and I want to read some of these and then we got to get to the Q&A Trent is talking too much which is you know surprise surprise for those of you who know me uh but I'm trying to do better with that and I wanna I want to get on to this and uh and explain this and then get to the live Q&A okay so I went on this protocol
 
 and my love handles started to disappear right I started talking about this protocol uh oh hopefully my screen share is working I started talking about this protocol with my friends with people that are I know people that are strangers I I started to post about it on social media I got literally hundreds and hundreds of people saying they reversed their fatty liver disease people saying they reversed uh they've lost over 50 pounds despite having Hashimoto this is Crystal in this case Crystal's got a great story hundreds of
 
 stories of people getting off their metformin getting off their drugs getting off their insulin and I'm not exaggerating there were literally I mean I get these every single week from people I've never met in my life that say hey Trent you know I just got my results I went from an A1C 8.0 to a 5.3 my doctor said I don't have diabetes anymore I can lose the metformin I literally have gotten hundreds of these messages from strangers who I've never met and now I'm starting to get them from friends and

G235	https://youtu.be/JSoCd5xK76o?si=V-97gx83KLqblBr2	[Music] hi friends and welcome to this week's episode I have Dr Leah antonich with me again um as you know Leah is one of my fantastic partners and has a wealth of knowledge but not only and but especially in the field of nutrition so we're going to talk today a little bit about this belly fat and insulin resistance thing because I know it's so frustrating for so many of you would you say I think it's one of the most common questions that we get welcome absolutely thank you so much and thank you for  having me back uh yes it is one of our top complaints that women coming in saying I'm doing the same thing or I'm doing more and I'm still getting this belly fatter I'm feeling softer the number on this scale is going up yeah so we believe you it really is true um part of it's lifestyle and part of it is hormonal so we want to talk about both of those aspects because it is a really annoying thing that happens in midlife and not only is it annoying like why do we care about insulin resistance and fat  ging around the middle I mean what's the big deal about it really so we know that increased visceral fat and insulin resistance are absolutely connected to all cause mortality so as those things go up inflammation goes up they're hand inand it's kind of a cyclical Cascade and we know that um all diseases cancer heart disease all of it um increases and you can die prematurely of these things right of course we think about type two diabetes related to insulin resistance but you're absolutely right I mean heart  disease cancers even dementia and all kinds of things and just dying early so it is really important not just looking good in our swimsuit but having the healthy long life that we want to so let's delve into how we can address that not just to look good but also to live longer right so when when I was growing up until quite recently we were taught that you eat fewer calories you lose weight right the calorie model or the so-called Weight Watchers model just eat less lose weight that's not working for us anymore  like what what are we missing there with the calorie counting method well um a couple of things with calorie counting because not all calories are the same number one so we know that we are very very very good at metabolizing carbohydrates 100% um whereas something like like protein we don't metabolize all of it in fact we utilize a lot of energy to metabolize it so probably about 80% of a gram compared to 100% of a gram of carbohydrate um also uh fiber so fiber although it's a carbohydrate is going to  be processed differently and it's going to have many beneficial effects and not Spike insulin so if I go and have white rice compared to having a sweet potato uh same amount of calories the effects on my body and the hormonal effects on my body are going to be completely different even including my sleep that night yeah so it's really time to abandon counting calories I think and so that that model doesn't work it doesn't work certainly as we're getting older not that calorie restriction won't cause  us to lose weight but it's not the end of the story by any means so so much more to it so you mentioned about you know carbohydrates and protein so let's just talk about insulin where does it come from what's its function and body and we know there's juvenile diabetics and type two diabetics kind of what's the basic story about that sure so um insulin is one of our many hormones in our body it's secreted by our pancreas and it has we'll just simplify this and say it has two main jobs one is to um put glucose into our  cells or even store that glucose a little bit as glycogen not important but that's the way it's stored also once the glycogen storages are full it actually gets stored as fat for us to use later on yeah which would make great sense right and our biological ancestral days we would have periods of time when we didn't have food so in times of excess it would make a lot of sense to store it as fat and then during the day even during the hours that we're not eating we need that glycogen in our muscles so  that we can run fast if we haven't eaten for four hours so all of this makes sense when our metabolism is working well but what can go wonky with that picture and what's causing this new thing where we get the belly fat so a couple of things can happen you know specifically in midlife something women experience is uh hormone deficiency so estrogen is very important for the liver to function to grab that Sugar out and testosterone plays a role as well and so just by fluctuation of just those hormones we can become insulin resistant  because those receptors aren't being expressed in um the way that we process glucose is has changed when that happens and the sugar is sitting in our bloodstream the body thinks hm well I'm going to go ahead and save this for Dr Susan later when she's trkking three days to go find Buffalo or running from the saber-tooth tiger and so our body is super smart that way well in our modern society we never go three days without food and we don't run from wild animals most of us anyway and so we keep packing  on that fat and our hormones decrease and there's other things that are affecting us in our modern day life like cortisol cortisol has a huge role to play on insulin um and over time as we're chronically stressed it keeps playing that role and we get fatter and fatter and fatter so for example similar analogy cortisol is another hormone and it's very important for fight ORF flight well if we're chronically stressed the body is constantly making sugar available to us to go run and to flee or to fight whatever we need to fight and  so that also ends up making us pack on on weight and it decreases our metabolism and our immune system among other things yeah all it's amazing isn't it that our lifestyles really lending towards this um fat storing model um you touched on cortisol also affected by sleep deprivation which I talk about a lot because it's it was so and do Leia struggles with this too you know for per menopause and menopause it's it can be really difficult to sleep that's a huge factor and then just the prevalence of  of high carbohydrate easy to reach for foods and and our environments so it seems like it seems like one thing after another stacking up against us almost isn't it absolutely but we can be successful right so you're going to tell us some ways that we can help this what feels like a fire burning out of control sometimes absolutely so I mean some very simple obvious things are you know our activity we all get tired of hearing that we have to move our body but when we are exercising even if we're using  our muscles a little bit more than normal we actually open up these channels for the sugar to just Dive Right In they don't even need insulin so just moving is an excellent way for us to fight insulin resistance and bring our glucose levels back to normal um we basically alluded to the fact that we need to get good sleep we really have to sleep like it's our job not only do we repair our bodies during that time but we also are able to decrease our cortisol and so many other things that will come into play if we are  chronically stressed and our cortisol is chronically High then we are going to stay insulin resistant and it's actually going to get worse yeah and it it can get a bit overwhelming can it because this is it it is very complex I mean hormonal science is very complicated and we are learning more about it all the time uh but it we can simplify it I think and and you do such a good job with this just to break it down to like what are the most important things so what I'm hearing is over time we're producing more insulin than we need our  body's not sensitive to it so we're storing sugar as fat how do we turn that around like what what are some simple things that any person could Implement Without Really disrupting their life and you can eat how about that you can eat quite a bit so high protein high fiber how simple is that I mean just start there and um if it doesn't have fiber in it and it's a carbohydrate just don't eat it there's plenty that are and you will feel full and you will feel good but the protein recommendations we've talked about as  well and then you know we could say let's just talk about the rule of 30s so we want 30 grams of protein at a meal we want 30 grams of fiber in the day and we don't want more than 30 grams of carbohydrate at a time and that's pretty simple right so I think that's very simple so if you can break it down to something you can actually Implement so for me if I focus on eating enough protein during the day that by itself solves a lot of other potential issues because eating 30 grams of protein four times a day so for me I'm trying to get  120 grams we've talked before about one gram per ideal body weight one gram of protein per ideal body weight in pounds so maybe that's around 120 pounds different than your goal weight much be might be much higher than that but what your ideal body weight is on a BMI chart so if I'm eating 120 grams of protein I'm pretty full pretty full yeah and then the fiber element of course makes us full as well 30 grams of fiber I we've talked here about fiber before that is hard to get now you're speaking  to someone who's had a plant-based diet much of my life a serving of vegetables may be two to three grams of fiber so it it's really takes some intentionality or fiber supplement which I do me too I love my fiber supplement so yeah so what's a what's good about fiber and how does it interact with sugar and Insulin fiber does so many things for your body but specifically regarding that it slows down the absorption of sugar um it also feeds the good bacteria in your intestinal tract which increases your  metabolism it also makes your intestinal tract more efficient and so it in its own way increases its energy in metabolism it also decreases cancers and makes you feel full so so many good things and it's so easy to do I've talked about the product I like there's so many out there I take a scoop of this product by happens to be by Thorn you know I love them it's it's made with Sun fiber so you mix it with water and it's not gritty and it's about 8 gr of fiber which might not sound like a whole lot  but that's a big chunk of my daily requirements and then several servings of vegetables so it takes a bit of time to get there but talking back to easy things protein fiber and water that's how sort of three-part nutrition Point absolutely so water fill us up absolutely water not only fills us up but when we're dehydrated it actually triggers a hormone in our brain to tell us that we're hungry so sometimes we just need to drink it also increases your blood sugar when you're dehydrated as well so being hydrated is really  really good as you know you don't necessarily have to carry around one of those jugs that I see people carrying around all the time but you know eight glasses or whatever it is is a a pretty good goal yeah I've heard there so many different recommendations for water just stay hydrated I think a really simple way is to make sure your urine is a very clear color not dark yellow uh some people say uh one ounce per half of your body weight so 60 ounces a day for me for example many ways to think about it  I just try to drink water regularly throughout the day yeah I I like the the urine test personally I think if it's light yellow to clear I know I'm hydrated that's really simple I we can over complicate things and it's very easy to go down a rabbit hole with any of this stuff right uh where we count for me if I'm counting all day I'm obsessed with food and for me being able to remove food from something I'm thinking about all day is really important so simple absolutely and that's a stress in itself right because  it's taking more effort and that's why people give up like I can't do this I can't do this I can't do this so find the simplest things that you can that that work for you and we'll do those you know like you like said on your last video people get so granular and they're down to the like 0.01 gram of this that or the other that's not important you know the big things the sleeping the moving your body high fiber High protein you know if you do that in the water then you're way ahead of the game that's right so try  that first now if someone came and saw you or saw me and said look I'm doing all this I'm eating my 120 gr I'm doing all those things or even if you wanted to do it before then we can do some diving into measuring your insulin measuring your sugar so let's talk about that and you you you can ask your doctor to do it but you can also do it yourself right and then just talk about what our goal value values are for those particular Labs because the lab has some pretty extraordinary ranges yes the lab does  have some extraordinary ranges you know they they take you know let's just say a thousand people off the street and they could be literally on death's door they could be in Optimal Health well we use different ranges we use Optimal Health ranges because we want you to be a blossoming flower not a wilted plant that's right you've always we want you to have an A+ not Aus exactly so um well let's start with fasting glucose most of y'all that most of yall know about that so 100 or less than 95 would be really  fantastic that's uh something though that if I don't eat long enough I'm I'm going to be able to hit that number so that's why we also look at to other values including our fasting insulin which ideally we would really like to be less than five and I believe the reported reference ranges go anywhere from two to 25 yeah they're really wide yeah if you have a so if you get your labs done and it say it's falling in the normal column actually look at that number because you could have a fusting insulin of 24 and it would still be red  as normal and you would be very very metabolically ill in that case so we want to look at the actual number so really as low as possible yeah but even even less than eight is very good very good um but then we also can move to another lab which yall are familiar with probably called the hemoglobin A1c and that is taking a look at Red cells that have kind of sugar on them we'll over simp that but it's a thre Monon calculation average of what we think the glucose is by looking at how many molecules of glucose or how  glycosilated the red blood cells are and again that's a range issue um a lot of people are told oh if you're 5.7 or higher you're a pre-diabetic well no there's no such thing as pre-diabetes that just means that you aren't yet being given a medication it means that you're already insulin resistant and as a matter of fact at 5.5 or higher there's a linear relationship with each tenth of a point that you increase your risk of all cause mortality that means cancer dementia heart attack everything yeah so we don't want to wait till you  get sick again if we're seeing that Trend up and I talked about this last week even if it went from five to 5.1 to 5.2 that's still going to be well within the normal range but it is suggesting that something's changing that we could intervene with early and you're probably noticing on as the human being in that equation that you're getting fat around the middle so in a certain respect you know we want to listen to you and what your symptoms are now I have patients I'm sure you do too who their lives look  great they might have a fasting insulin that's seven and a fasting glucose of 85 and their hemoglobin a1c's normal they're still struggling with this and in fact they are insulin resistant where it's not picking it up on that fasting panel so there's some other ways if you feel like that's happening like oh my gosh they said I'm fine dig a Little Deeper because sometimes our sugar goes up later in the day we might have spikes going on that are not being picked up on that test our average sugar could even  be normal but average of 100 it could be ranging from 40 to 180 so digging into that a little bit more what are some suggestions for that well that's a person I would absolutely recommend a continuous glucose monitor yeah um and I I do we do see patients like that so we know that we're just not catching with those tests what's really going on and we know that they're insulin resistant right yeah sometimes that's so true and if you feel like this and I I have so many patients who do that are being told  you're fine your Labs look great it must just be in your head or you're secretly eating in the closet I've had patients tell me this terrible no you know when you're not fine you know when something's changed and you're always right we just haven't found it yet so dig a Little Deeper CGM is a great idea you don't need to be diabetic to have a continuous glucose monitor anyone can get one I mean Insurance might not cover it but it's an investment that you and I worn ourselves I think it's very useful  and surprising sometimes um how our sugar can change with fruits that one might not think and then other ways that we can intervene if it is spiking high so for example what's an example you can think of if you eat a certain thing your sugar goes up and what's an intervention that could change that so for in my personal experimentation I um absolutely love ice cream so much yeah so I actually ran the experiment so I ate the ice cream and with one kind my sugar actually got up to 180 I couldn't believe it actually it was an ice cream  it was straight up cookies with no fat but um then I did the same thing and I had um fiber and protein before it and it only went up to 140 and now it did stay it did take a long time for it to come down but the point is that it didn't Spike um and that just goes to show you how fiber and protein and the changes that they make in our intestinal system and changes that they make in the hormones on the brain can allow us to kind of hack things I'm not saying go around and eat a salad and then ice  cream that's not what I'm saying but have fiber and protein before you have your carbohydrate for example and then sometimes we are going to want to enjoy something that's off our uh personal rules for what we know we should eat and those are really great interventions and then uh you'd mentioned something really interesting too about how sugar is stored in our liver and muscles in the form of glycogen another way to to drop your sugar is use your muscles right exercise I've seen that myself it makes  a dramatic difference you go for a walk and it's dropped absolutely so um you can if you have a continuous glucose monitor on you can actually walk around for a couple of minutes or even just do some jumping jacks or some body squats and things like that and you will just just see it go down so one thing that you can do if you're kind of struggling with well gosh after I eat my sugars are really going up you can titrate the amount of carbohydrate and you can also move your body until it goes down to 140  or 120 preferably or something like that so these are all little things that you can do and measure well what do I need to do in my own body you know can I eat regular potatoes or can I not eat regular potatoes does it have to always be with the peel or without the peel and you can figure all of those things out this fruit does this to me and this fruit I was totally even K so important really important point I think you made is that there's not a nutrition plan that works for every person the same way  because it is really interesting with this type of technique where you can see what works for you and I found that in my own body so if you are interested in ordering a continuous glucose monitor you do need a doctor to prescribe it for you I would simply ask your doctor to do that um quite easy to do and certainly not covered by insurance but it might be an investment that will help you if you're struggling and wondering why is this happening like I don't know what else to do that can often unlock some  answers so what I'm hearing is protein fiber water sleep movement I mean could we do five things it sounds like a lot of things and I talked about 10 things last week it seems like a lot of things but these are these are doable not too diffult I think they're not too difficult and again if you're just if you're not overthinking it and you even start focusing on one thing for the month and then that becomes a habit then you don't have to think about it anymore and then you can build on these other things that's another reason I  think people get frustrated and stop is they try to change too many things they make it too complicated and the Brain literally rejects it because it feels like too much work it's not not memory for them it's not natural for them so don't overdo it think about easing into just one thing at a time some things that I've done and you might find some things similar in order to get the supplements that I need putting them in a memorable place I just thought of an example my fiber is I like my coffee  every morning right by my coffee pot is my little thing with my fiber so every morning I'm reminded oh I do my scoop of fiber with my probiotic and then I have my cup of coffee whatever works for you to make it easy so I've done that thousand times now so I do it every day and actually now I'm at a point where for some reason my fiber wasn't there or if I'm traveling I'm like oh thought something was missing exactly so these are such simple habits um if you're consistent you to do it over and over in  like any habit do it over and over it becomes ingrained similar with the protein habit just I love what you said about the 30 grams and just I'd love for you to repeat that because it's such a good thing to remember sure the rule of 30s um so 30 grams of protein in a meal not more than 30 grams of carbohydrate and you want 30 grams of fiber in the day yeah so looking i' I've gotten in the habit of doing this which is quite fantastic because of your advice thank you I'll look at whatever it is that I'm  about to eat and that will just occur to me okay does this have 30 grams of protein um does it have more than 30 grams of carbs maybe I can switch a ruid a little bit in order for it to meet that or maybe there are times that no it doesn't and I'm going to mindfully just eat something that I know isn't perfect but I'm not doing it without being aware that that's what I'm doing exactly and progress not Perfection that's right progress not Perfection so don't don't get all tied up some other some other  little helpful hacks too that um you know I do a lot of people do drinking a little apple cider vinegar before a meal and or after a meal which also can help with heartburn um you know there's a supplement that um we've talked a lot about berberine which can help stabilize blood sugar cinnamon U turmeric you know there's other things I'm not saying go go and and um start taking all of these things and don't make any changes I'm not saying that at all but these are tools that can help us especially when  we're trying to find that new normal to get those blood sugars down and get our insulin down more importantly so if you came into an office and we measured your inulin and and we see this all the time um and it's a bit high so for example over eight as we were suggesting and your sugar's a little high you're not diabetic but you're struggling with fat around the middle and you're starting to walk down that path to WS type two diabetes it's remarkable how quickly that can change and and tell us what you  see in your patients like so they they start these interventions they're following the rule of 30s and doing their movement they're sleeping better watching those stress it truly can change in you know several weeks and a couple of months I mean very quick results for sure I mean a lot of times I see people back at about the six week Mark and I definitely their body compass change by doing those five simple things the Sleep the protein the fiber the water and the changing the carbohydrate again just making it a complex  carbohydrate so uh it's really that fast it's that fast and you did get this way you know it took you two decades maybe to get in this state so give it more than two days to work but it does it does work anything where you lose weight rapidly is very likely not going to result in long-term success so we're really interested in getting you to your healthiest body composition and staying there forever so let's talk about that a little bit because a lot of uh very nutritionally restricted or calorie  restricted weight loss plants are going to result in weight loss and we see this a lot actually with um some of these weight loss drugs that we do love The glp1 Agonist in particular in the community where people are just not eating at all right and so what can happen that goes wonky in that situation that causes us to gain a bad well a a couple of things so a um you're slowing down your metabolism so your body is very very smart and it says oh my goodness you know there's no food around so I'm going to slowly is metabolism  down so there's that and then there is the fact that you are depriving yourself of precious nutrients that you need so I have seen people go into the hospital for all kinds of things I've seen them have neurologic difficulties because they're so deficient I've seen them um have to go in the hospital for uh problems with their kidneys I've had all kinds of things and you need nutrition you need to eat especially protein has we talked about so starving ourselves a protein absolutely protein has so many  nutrients in it eggs have nutrients all of that and then thirdly we found out that in more recent studies that actually the yo-yo dieting even just the five pounds up and down probably has more longterm um Health detriment than if you had just stayed whatever weight that it was because of the metabolic changes that are going on and the stresses in your body and the inflammation that that can cause so anything that's done rapidly not to mention the muscle loss as well so if you're losing weight rapidly so there is  a way to do things in it and nothing almost nothing is going to be you know a quick fix yeah slow and steady but it's remarkably fast when I say slow and steady so um we frequently see patients in a healthy manner losing up to 10 pounds of fat a month without losing muscle now that would be someone who has quite a bit of weight to lose but you can imagine you know I always think time's going to pass either way it's going to be a year from now soon enough so where am I going to be a year from now you know so just thinking of it as a  long-term plan and then just let those habits settle in and it just sort of takes care of itself I think rather than like you said being so I've done it obsessed on details right so make it simple and it'll stick I think that's great advice so we talked about muscles so muscles really interesting in this whole insin resistant picture isn't it because not only do we store glycogen and now muscles but having more muscle mass independently is beneficial for weight loss on so many levels right so let's  talk about the importance of muscle again I know you're tired of me talking about it but it's so important well it Bears repeating because H you know I had a patient the other day that just did not want to increase her protein intake and I just started explaining so many things so if I sit here and I have more muscle mass I'm going to burn more calories just sitting here doing nothing um not to mention if I have more muscle I'm also just GNA extract glucose from my bloodstream and I'm not going to turn  it into fat which is going to turn into inflammation which is going to turn into all kinds of metabolic diseases and disorders I also as a woman well even as a man but as a woman am i g to protect my bones I'm going to be strong I'm not going to fall if I do fall fall I'm going to have a cushion I'm not going to have a fracture um and I'm also if I have more muscle mass going to have more energy throughout the day when I walk up the stairs I'm not going to be winded when I take those groceries home I'm gonna just  you know walk with them freely and not be yeah out of breath so it it impacts our complete and total lives all aspects that really does and that reminds me of something personal story in my skinny fat days which happened in per menopause I was very did a lot of aerobic activity but didn't do any strength training and my body fat got up higher than it should be and my muscle mass was quite low I remember carrying the Christmas ornaments up to the attic which is an activity many of us do annually and just  thinking I can't even pick up this box I'm just feeling weak which for me and you might resonate with this it corresponded with the feeling of mental weakness like help me I can't I need like I can't do it by myself rather than I got this this I can do it so I think there's so many factors but the physical strength correlating with just sort of mental Wellness too is something that often is not talked about it's all of the things I mean there's just nothing there's no downside to have more muscle  mass you have to exercise to get it which is good in the meantime and then once you've got it it helps you to be healthier so it's a fantastic virtuous cycle yeah and having that muscle mass you're going to burn that cortisol I mean it's just it's the opposite of the bad Cascade it's the good Cascade so we all know how to get muscle we just have to do the work and it is a commitment to your future and you alluded to this but if we have insulin resistance the the treatment is quite well written we just have to follow it  and it's those things right just what I heard you say protein fiber water movment muscle mass sleep the things that we know are good for us and I think um we were talking about this earlier today sometimes and I've been one of these people too no judgment sometimes we have patients who just are like I don't want that watch the magic I need the watch the pill for this like what the magic button there isn't one really and if someone tells you that there is I mean it's just it's a it's a lifestyle  change and it's one that I can tell you it really does feel good it feels good to be strong it does I I get the same thing if I feel weak I get depressed and I mean you know I was like my gosh what am I going to be like in 20 years it feels very I felt very old like oh my this is going in a direct just nothing good a very negative emotional state I think and then we all know exercise helps us to feel better because of the endorphins we all know too we feel terrible when our Sugar's too high or too low absolutely it's a nice feeling  to have stable sugar throughout the day the brain fog that goes with that sugar low too so I mean I eat a low carb lunch and um that way I can continue to function you'll all know what food coma is and you know and your brain's not functioning and you're already feeling maybe not great and then you're like oh one more thing I'm broken I'm broken I'm broken it's just this I to do when I feel like that eat a candy bar for sure and that's why your your brain's literally telling you to do that too your brain's like I'm I'm low on sugar  we need to yeah go get the dut yeah yeah and these Cravings are very real so um it happens and I felt that way too so not negating that it's it's simple but not easy which lends into this is I think a really important part of any program that's addressing weight management or habit change is is the Mind State part and so that's a big part of our weight loss program and I know that's something you're really passionate about we can say all day do these things but it's very difficult to implement if our mind is derailing us so  what are some this is very important I mean in any type of program where we're trying to change anything it comes from our mind yeah so what's your motivation and your motivation cannot be oh it's my high school reunion I want to be back in my skinny jeans it that is a very very limited motivation in a time that's going to pass and then you're going to be high school reunions over or I didn't make my goal and you might even gain weight so how is it how about I want to feel like this I want to be able to be  on the floor with my grandchildren I want to be the whipper snapper that's driving all my friends around when I'm 85 well we'll all have autonomous vehicles at that point but you know what I mean you need a motivation that is longterm and that truly speaks to you so there's that so why are you doing this and then you need to think about the things and the roadblocks that you have faced and will continue to face and how to hedge against those um a daily morning practice spiritual practice in general but surrounding your goals  whatever they are is very very important about the first half hour that you're awake your brain is still in that's theta waves and is very receptive to things so literally telling yourself things out loud writing things down I have statements written in sharpy and on my mirrors all over my house and they change and but they do work and I do say them out loud I also practice something called thought stopping um as soon as that negative voice comes into my head head and I assure you that it does I  exchange that and I say I literally out loud say stop or in my mind I say no and I reverse that and I say the opposite because I have done X or because I know this to be true in my past uh one other thing for changing a behavior whether it's eating or decreasing um alcohol or decreasing screen time is to use an acronym called Halt and that's hungry angry lonely tired those are all triggers for us to eat or consume whether that's consume um television or consume alcohol or drugs or whatever it is and you can um look at those things  and be mindful and be like okay I am truly hungry I'm G to eat real food first and then if I still want X Y and Z then I'm going to mindfully take a portion of that cake or whatever it is but um being angry it could be any kind of extreme emotion usually anger lonely um also could be bored you're looking for something to do and then tired of course is tired so you can try to take a nap do a two-minute breathing exercise that empowers your um brain or you can actually you know go to bed early and  practice sleep hygiene all of the above which is such a beautiful idea and it Al it sounds like it's all just different forms of being aware of what what going on in our mind because I've certainly had this experience and I'm sure you have too listening of eating mindlessly eating while I'm doing something else and not paying attention to what I'm eating not even enjoying what I'm eating um so not noticing even did I wow did I just eat a bag of chips I didn't notice so just uh television and devices off  when you're eating right yeah really good ideas so just as a review I think he did a beautiful job talking about what ins slers is this hormone gets too high it tricks our body into storing more sugar and turning that into fat for the Arctic winter that's not coming anytime soon and we need to turn that around so our body thinks it's okay to burn fat right because I I think our body's so smart and me so incredibly intelligent it's really trying to help us but our body sort of forgot that we're not caveman  living in a state of potential starvation or not going to be chased by a tiger uh so was chronic stress is tricking us into thinking something's going on so yeah I want to I don't know nurture with compassion this body that's so intelligent and trying to help us by feeding her really healthy food and you know just going back to what we've talked about before this whole idea that we really are what we eat you know and treating your body as a temple and all these things that we know yeah treat her  kindly feat her some good delicious nutritious food not that crappy bunch of chemicals on the back of the box uh and she'll respond well to compassion just like every living being would absolutely yeah well I I'm just so glad to have you here and I I think your message is so positive because it can lead to despair I was there it's like why is this happening to me how can I be gaining fat around the middle when I'm literally running marathons and I know many of you resonate with that I can tell you in my case I wasn't eating  enough protein I was over exercising not sleeping enough living a very high stress life eating lots of sugar you know it happens and there's nothing wrong with you but we can address it so you can live a longer healthier life absolutely any final words that um you think are helpful because I know you have such a there we could talk for hours about this we really could well um just nurture yourself be kind to yourself be mentally and physically kind to yourself treat yourself like you would your very best  friend or a sister that you love or someone like that so yeah really good advice well I'm so glad that you were able to highlight some of these things and if you would like to see Leah in the office uh you know how to reach us at complet midlife Wellness center.com um Leah has different visits you would visit with a patient for hormone consultation nutritional consultation to be part of our weight loss program any of the above whatever we can do to help we can assess your CGM data if you have that all of these  things because it it some we just need a part partner and a friend on this journey doing it by yourself is hard yeah so uh we're we're here to help you to be successful and you can be I'm an example she is too how patients are living proof that this actually works and it's really not that hard and then you feel great yeah yeah well

V235	https://youtu.be/n28W4AmvMDE?si=BNqNOgLdjeGgrwyZ	welcome to the huberman Lab podcast where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday [Music] life I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and Opthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine my guest today is Dr Robert lustig Dr Robert lustig is an endocrinologist that is he's a specialist in the function of hormones in the body and a professor of Pediatric Endocrinology at the University of California San Francisco he has authored more than 100 peer-reviewed studies exploring how different types of
 
 nutrients that is food impact our cellular functioning our organ functioning and thereby our health during today's discussion we discussed the idea of whether or not a calorie is indeed a calorie and whether or not our body weight and body composition only reflects the number of calories we eat versus the calories that we burn we talk about how different food types that is how the different macronutrients protein fat and carbohydrates are processed in the body and the important role that fiber and the gut microbiome plays in
 
 that process and we pay particular attention to the topic of how different types of sugars and fructose in particular can indeed be addictive to the brain and can modify the way that hormones in the body in particular insulin impact our Liver Health Kidney Health and indeed the health of all of our cells and organs indeed Dr lustig is an expert in how sugar impacts the brain and body we talk about how certain types of sugars can indeed be addictive in the same way that certain drugs of abuse and
 
 behaviors can become addictive so in other words how sugar actually changes the way that the brain works and we discuss how the food industry that is the commoditization and sale of particular types of food has altered the way that we eat and indeed the foods that We crave today's discussion covers all of that and by the end of today's discussion you'll have a thorough understanding of how foods are processed when they enter your body and how those different food choices are impacting your immediate and long-term Health
 
 before we begin I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to Consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is eight sleep eight sleep makes Smart mattress covers with cooling Heating and sleep tracking capacity I've spoken many times before in this podcast about the fact that
 
 sleep is the foundation of Mental Health physical health and performance now a key component of getting a great night's sleep is that in order to fall and stay deeply asleep your body temperature actually has to drop by about 1 to 3 de and in order to wake up feeling refreshed and energized your body temperature actually has to increase by about 1 to 3° one of the best ways to make sure that those temperature changes occur at the appropriate times at the beginning and throughout and at the end of your night when you wake up is to
 
 control the temperature of your sleeping environment and that's what eight sleep allows you to do it allows you to program the temperature of your mattress and sleeping environment such that you fall and stay deeply asleep easily and wake up each morning feeling incredibly refreshed and energized I've been sleeping on an eight Sleep mattress cover for almost 3 years now and it has dramatically improved the quality of my sleep so much so that when I travel and I'm at a hotel or an Airbnb and I don't
 
 have access to my eight sleep I very much look forward to getting home because my sleep is always better when I sleep on my eights Sleep mattress cover if you'd like to try eights sleep you can go to 8sleep.com / huberman to get $150 off their pod 3 mattress cover eight sleep currently ships in the USA Canada UK select countries in the EU and Australia again that's 8sleep.com huberman today's episode is also brought To Us by levels levels is a program that lets you see how different foods affect
 
 your health by giving you real-time feedback on your diet using a continuous glucose monitor one of the most important factors in your immediate and long-term health is your blood sugar or blood glucose regulation with levels you can see how different foods and food combinations exercise and sleep patterns impact your blood glucose levels it's very easy to use you just put the monitor on the back of your arm and then you take your phone and you scan it over that monitor now and again and it downloads the data about your blood
 
 sugar levels in the preceding hours using levels has allowed me to learn a tremendous amount about what works best for me in terms of nutrition exercise work schedules and sleep so if you're interested in learning more about levels and trying a continuous glucose monitor you can go to levels. l/ huberman levels has launched a new CGM sensor that is smaller and has even better tracking than the previous version right now they're also offering an additional two free months of membership again that's
 
 levels. linkhub to try the new sensor and two free months of membership today's episode is also brought To Us by Aeropress Aeropress is similar to a French press for making coffee but is in fact a much better way to make coffee I first learned about Aeropress well over 10 years ago and I've been using one ever since Aeropress was developed by Allan Adler who was an engineer at Stanford and I knew of Allen because he had also built the so-called aobi frisbee which I believe at one time perhaps still now held the Guinness Book
 
 of World Records for furthest Throne object and I used to see Allan believe it or not at parks around paloalto testing out different aobi frisbees so he was sort of famous in our community for developing these different Feats of engineering that turned into commercial products now I love coffee I'm somebody that drinks coffee nearly every day usually about 90 to 120 minutes after I wake up in the morning although not always sometimes if I'm going to exercise I'll drink coffee first thing in the morning but I love love love
 
 coffee and what I've personally found is that by using the arero Press I can make the best possible tasting cup of coffee I don't know what exactly it is in the arero press that allows the same beans to be prepared into a cup of coffee that tastes that much better as compared to any other form of Brewing that coffee even the traditional French press the aerrow Press is extremely easy to use and it's extremely compact in fact I take it with me whenever I travel and I use it on the road in hotels even on
 
 planes I'll just ask for some hot water and I'll Brew my coffee or tea right there on the plane if you'd like to try Aeropress you can go to arero press.com huberman that's a r o p rs.com huberman to get 20% off any Aeropress coffee maker Aeropress sh anywhere in the USA Canada and over 60 other countries around the world again that's Aero press.com huberman to get 20% off and now for my discussion with Dr Robert lustig Dr Robert lustig welcome pleasure truly uh just being here being invited uh high honor really
 
 appreciate it and it's not doctor it's just Rob okay Rob I've been looking forward to this conversation for a long time I've seen your now famous can we also say Infamous but famous YouTube video about sugar we'll put a link to it in the show note captions it's been viewed many many millions of times yeah and I still can't figure out why that is you know I didn't think my mother would watch it and she didn't but 24 and a half million people did well I think people are very interested in what to
 
 eat what not to eat and we'll start off simply talking about what most everyone believes and understands which is that a calorie is a form of heat energy that's given off during the processing of some food bit or something if that's mysterious to people just understand that a calorie is a unit of energy and I was taught and still many many people worldwide believe that a calorie is a calorie meaning if I consume more calories in whatever form then I metabolize by thinking feeling moving exercising Etc then I will gain
 
 weight and if I consume fewer calories than I burn I will lose weight and we could talk a lot about where that weight loss comes from does it come from adapost body fat stores or from muscle or from protein or muscle of course is protein Etc but let's start off with is a calorie truly a calorie when it comes to the processing of different types of calories everyone thinks that obesity is about energy balance that is calories in calories out therefore two behaviors gluttony and sloth therefore if you're fat it's your
 
 fault therefore diet and exercise therefore any calorie can be part of a balanced diet therefore don't pick on our calories go pick on somebody else's calories this is actually actually what the food industry uses to assuage their culpability for the change in the food supply and the rise in obesity and chronic disease like diabetes now it is true that a calorie is that unit of energy that raises one gram of water one degre centigrate and so therefore a calorie burned is a calorie burned I don't argue that that's true that's you
 
 know the first law thermodynamics but that doesn't mean a calorie eaten is a calorie eaten that's not the same and that's where people get it wrong so let me give you some examples of how that calorie eaten is not a calorie eating you like almonds I do me too almonds are great okay you eat 160 calories in almonds how many of those do you absorb 130 you eat 160 you absorb 130 where' the other 30 go in the processing of that food energy no turn out the fiber in those almonds both soluble and insoluble fiber and by
 
 the way fiber is sort of the key to the kingdom in this story forms a gel on the inside of your intestin the insoluble fiber the cellulose forms a fishnet if you will lattice work on the inside of your dadum the soluble fiber which are globular plug the holes in that fish net together they form a secondary barrier you can actually see it on electron microscopy a whitish gel and that prevents absorption of those 30 calories so yes 130 get absorbed but many of them don't they end up going further down the intestine to
 
 the next part called the junam and that's where the microbiome is now everyone knows about the microbiome nowadays you know it's all the bacteria you know we always say when women are pregnant you're eating for two well we're always eating for 100 trillion now they have to eat well what do they eat they eat what you eat the question is how much did you get versus how much did they get well if you ate almonds they're getting those 30 calories so even though you count the calories at your lips that doesn't matter what really
 
 matters is counting the calories at your intestinal brush border okay and they're not the same so if you feed your gut that's a good thing because then your gut will take those calories and turn it into things like short chain fatty acids which end up being protective against chronic metabolic disease acetate propionate butyrate valorate those are actually good they're anti-inflammatory anti-alzheimer's because you fed your microbiome so even though you ate 160 you absorbed 130 so a calorie eaten is
 
 not a calorie eaten because if you ate it with fiber it wasn't for you it was for your bacteria but that's not the way you count them up so that's problem number one problem number two amino acids so we all eat protein let's say you eat too much protein yeah you know the Porter House steak all right now if you're a bodybuilder those amino acids might go to muscle and you might increase your muscle mass because you're a bodybuilder because you're putting uh excess uh force on those muscles and you're growing those
 
 muscles okay but let's say you're not a bodybuilder let's say you're a mmortal like me or let's say you're a kid going through puberty who's synthesizing a lot of muscle not because they're lifting weights because they're because testosterone's making it happen yeah absolutely but let's say you're not let's say you know you're just you know just schlump the the street like uh you know joeo okay and you eat that Porter House you've taken on all these amino acids there's no place to store it other
 
 than muscle so your liver takes the excess and deamidates that amino acid takes the amino group off to turn it from a amino acid into an organic acid and then that organic acid can then enter the kreb cycle the tricarboxylic acid cycle what goes on in the mitochondria in order to generate ATP the chemical energy that your body needs in order to power itself okay now that's a good thing it takes double the amount of energy to prepare that amino acid for burning as it does to uh prepare a carbohydrate for burning or fat because
 
 when I asked about when you asked about almonds why the the 160 versus 130 I thought it was the processing it turned out it was fiber you're saying for protein let's it let's make it realistic for a a really nice big porterhouse steak which I love by the way let's say let's say 800 calories yeah well it turns how how much of that is is uh so that's what goes in your mouth right my mouth right how much of it is actually um eaten in uh to stay with the your calorie eaten is not a calorie eaten in
 
 the processing of that what percentages actually goes into your total caloric intake right so about 10% of everything you eat goes to just maintaining body temperature it's called the thermic effect of food but when you're eating protein you actually generate more Heat and the reason is because it takes to ATP to phosphorate that organic acid as opposed to one ATP to uh phosphorate that carbohydrate for uh consumption so you actually have a net loss of energy because it was a an amino acid versus a
 
 monosaccharide a sugar now you you brought up fat fat doesn't need to be phosphorilated so it actually doesn't have any um thermic effective food at that point so depends on what it is as to whether or not you have loss okay so but in this um let's make it actually realistic a 1600 calorie uh Porter House with a nice slab of of uh of grass-fed butter on there I do this every once in a while not not often with some cream spinach and maybe some mushrooms along the side honestly I say when I'm eating
 
 a porter house I don't want to adulterate The Taste okay with anything else except maybe some some butter maybe a salad okay afterwards but but let's say 1600 calories of of it's got some fat in there for sure uh let's say um uh a thousand of those calories is protein mhm the other 600 are fat something like that something like that depending on how marbled it is okay so based on what you just said about the thermic effect of food and protein in particular of that thousand calories how much actually is can we count I'm not a
 
 calorie counter but does one include as calories truly ingested well if you ingested 1600 well that's what went in the mouth but but but what is is going to go against your your uh burn deficit right so I would have to actually do the math to figure that out but as a guess yeah back of the envelope back of the envelope calculation you're going to lose about 25% of that wow so we're talking 750 calories yeah you know so and to translate this a bit so what we're saying here is if you're somebody who is trying to lose weight or maintain
 
 weight or perhaps even gain weight you eat a 1 1600 calorie Porter House with a slab of butter on it 600 of those calories we're saying in this instance is fat of the remaining thousand calories that's that all in your mouth so you count it at your mouth right but 700 but then when you compare it against your energy burn for that day to maintain temperature brain activity physical activity really it's only 750 calories that's right that's a huge difference exactly and another reason why a calorie is not a calorie now let's
 
 take the third let's take fats so over here we have omega-3s heart healthy anti-inflammatory anti-alzheimer's save your life and over here we have trans fats the devil incarnate consumable poison because you can't break the trans double bond you don't have the desaturates to break that trans double bond so it basically accumulates lines your arteries lines your liver causes chronic metabolic disease causes insulin resistance Omega-3s don't even get broken down for energy because they're so important they
 
 stay intact because your brain needs them your heart needs them whereas trans fats can't be broken down because of that trans double bond one save your life other one kill you they're both nine calories per gram if you explode them in a bomb calorimeter because a calorie burned is a calorie burned but a calorie eaten is not a calorie eaten because one will save your life one will kill you and finally the Big Kahuna the one that blows everything else out of the water fructose and glucose all right now
 
 glucose is the energy Al life so here we're talking carbohydrates I think most of our audience will be familiar with the so-called macronutrients so we talked about fat in this case almonds there's some Fiber in there probably a little bit of carbohydrate a little bit little bit talked about the Porter House with butter right making me hungry already that's protein and fat MH very little of any carbohydrate it should be zero essentially maybe one zero zero yep um and then now we're talking about
 
 carbohydrates and we're going to subdivide that into glucose and fructose right galactose basically becomes glucose in the liver so we we can dispense with that unless you have a disease called galactosemia which is about one in 20,000 um and causes neonatal menitis and you know it's a disease as a pediatric endocrinologist I would take care of but we can dispense with that for the moment all right so glucose fructose glucose is the energy of life every cell on the planet Burns glucose for energy glucose is so damn
 
 important that if you don't consume it your body makes it so it will take an amino acid and turn it into glucose that's gluconeogenesis glucogenesis that's right it will take a fatty acid and turn it into glucose and specifically the glycerol portion of the uh triglyceride will turn into glucose so the Inuit they didn't have any place to grow carbohydrate they had ice they had whale blubber they still have serum glucose level and the reason is because because you had to you have to have a serum
 
 glucose level in order to power your brain in order to power your heart yes you you can use ketones of course you can but you know only if you're in a ketogenic state will you use exclusively ketones and you also need glucose for structural changes in specific proteins and particularly hormones so glucose molecules will stud TSH la FSH different pituitary hormones in order to increase their potency it's one of the reasons why aging leads to defective hormonogenesis for instance hypogonadism hypothyroidism is the loss of
 
 glycosilation on individual um uh uh peptide hormones because of uh the inability to add glucose because of insulin insens just it's an aging phenomenon okay we'll come come back to this because I think it's really important yeah the idea that ingestion of carbohydrates and the as you called it the studying of carbohydrate molecules on hormones can augment the function of those hormones and with aging that's a less efficient process a less efficient process but it's not because of consumption it's right people are still
 
 I I see the the uh plenty of folks who are uh 65 and older eating plenty of carbohydrates you're saying a lot of them have defic thyroid testosterone estrogen um prolactin Etc because of the way that those carbohydrates are not studing the uh the hormones exactly so they're all of those are glycoprotein hormones let's tea that up for later because I think that's an interesting Avenue to go down okay and there's a and there's a disease in children in in babies called congenital disorders of glycosilation
 
 where you can't put uh uh glucose Mo uh molecules on specific proteins and it causes severe mental retardation all sorts of metabolic havoc and a lot of those babies die for that matter so that's an important thing all right but that's how important glucose is fructose on the other hand this sweet molecule the molecule we seek the reason why the food industry studs every food in the grocery store you 73% of all items in the American Grocery Store have added sugar on purpose for the food industry's purposes not for yours
 
 because fructose is addictive activates the nucleus accumbens the reward center of the brain in the same way that cocaine heroin nicotine alcohol do and drives dopamine receptors down just like nicotine you know alcohol you know cocaine heroin do that molecule fructose is number one uh completely sigil to all vertebrate life there is no biochemical reaction in any vertebrate that requires dietary fructose that's number one number two okay so sorry I'm going to just answer so you're saying that even though we can
 
 process fructose we have a limited capacity to process it in the same way we have a limited capacity to metabolize alcohol now if you have one drink a day yeah you're okay if you have two drinks a day depends on how big you are you know you and I can probably I would argue two drinks a week is the maximum but but let's not go there the um but but in terms of you're saying when you say fructose processing a fructose is vestigal what you're saying is that we don't need to do it it's like the appendix it's an organ for which it has
 
 no function exactly and fructose has no function in the human body period you don't need it you don't need it don't need it but our diet is replete with it in fact our fructose consumption has gone up 25 fold since the beginning of the last century I have to ask this now I love fruit I eat berries Galore especially since the price of berries seems to have come down it used to be that you only get them certain times of year I'm what you call a drive by blueberry eater so I'll just walk past and just take a fistful you can't put
 
 them in front of me without me eating them this is even difficult for me when other people I don't know are eating them so um I eat lots of blueberri strawberries blackberries if they're in season I love them no problem loaded with fructose no plenty of fiber low fructose low fructose and berries berries are the lowest fructose of all the so worried about asking you this today thank you okay um and fruit is okay because of the fiber so the molecule the fructose molecule is the same whether it's in a berry or in a
 
 banana or for that matter in a Coca-Cola the fructose molecule is the same molecule the difference is that in the berry it comes with a whole lot of fiber in the banana comes with a whole lot less fiber and in the Coca-Cola it doesn't come with any fiber and the fiber is what mitigates the absorption so when you consume the fructose with fiber so your blueberries you're feeding your microbiome that fructose wasn't for you got it such a relief and um I I must say recently I had a whole body MRI as a preemptive
 
 thing uh someone that it was it was great I got to watch a Netflix in there and um I never had a whole body MRI I learned a few things that were useful to me I've got a clean bill of health so that's great one of the pie the feedback I got is um that my gut was filled with this very high contrast um stuff right and they asked you know do you consume a lot of blueberries and I said indeed I do why and they said um because that high contrast stuff it shows up white on the scan is um high concentrations of
 
 magnesium um that we see in people that ingest large amounts of blueberries which is pretty rare and yours are comparable to a bear in blueberry season wow um and basically my entire gut was filled with with blueberries I suppose I need to cut back a little bit but now I know that fruit is okay especially if the fruit has a lot of fiber yeah but fructose itself especially if it's not partnered with fiber yeah is first of all not required for survival at all but you're telling me is uh problematic yeah and let me tell you
 
 why it's problematic we haven't gotten to that yet we're just talking about whether it's vestigal versus needed now let's talk about what fructose does turns out fructose inhibits three count them three separate enzymes necessary for normal mitochondrial function now your mitochondria make at TP your mitochondria have to work at Peak efficiency that's what metabolic health is is mitochondria working at Peak efficiency well there are three enzymes that are inhibited by fructose number one amyas all right now amp kinas is the
 
 fuel gauge on the liver cell it's the thing that tells the liver to make more mitochondria fresher mitochondria because if your am levels are high that means you've phosphorated a bunch of atps and you have to regenerate them so you need some more mitochondria so it's a negative feedback pathway well you need that amp kyes to generate that mitochondrial biogenesis signal except that fructose a metaboli of fructose called methylglyoxal MGO sits in the active site of the gamma subunit of that amp kinas and actually
 
 binds to arginines in that active site rendering that uh um enzyme now dead it's an irreversible inhibition because of the Cove valent bonding of that methylglyoxal that alahh to the Arginine and now that enzyme is dead Okay so it basically acts like a key that doesn't turn the lock but prevents the the key that you want in that lock from entering the the lock it's like it's like gluing a lock shut yeah got it all right so that's one of the enzymes that's one okay second one aad L asil COA dehydrogenase longchain so this is
 
 necessary to cleave two carbon fragments of fatty acids to prepare them for uh uh metabolism so it inhibits that one and then finally it inhibits carnitine pidal transferase one now cpt1 now that's the enzyme that regenerates carnitine carnitine is the shuttle mechanism by which you get the uh fatty acids from the outer mitochondrial membrane through to the inner mitochondrial membrane so that they can be beta oxidized for energy so if you don't have that c uh cpt1 you're basically carnitin and
 
 therefore you can't generate um beta oxidation you said fructose inhibits all three of these enzymatic Pathways y as a biologist I have to ask you know how potently does it inhibit them I mean because there's there are drugs that block receptors and then there are drugs that block receptors with in unbelievable Affinity so you know I mean mechanistically in a dish meaning in vitro you can see all sorts of things but how how significant is this for like for obesity for mitochondrial function in Vivo in us all right so look you know
 
 the the dose determines the poison right paracelsus 1537 um there are toxins that are parts per billion and will kill you like sarin rysen Cyanide by the way cyanide is a good analogy because it's working on mitochondria it's basically causing mitochondria to be completely defective all right then there are um intermediate toxins like Arsenic and carbon tetrachloride parts per million and they take a little longer to work they're not going to kill you on the spot that's why I can eat an apple seed that has a
 
 little bit of arsenic in it but I'm not going to die right and then finally there and by the tobacco smoke goes in there and then finally you have um uh weak toxins all right and you know where it's not one exposure that will kill you it's you know 10,000 exposures that'll kill you like alcohol or toxic people yeah or toxic wellx couldn't resist sorry sometimes it don't mildly toxic people anyway the point is that fructose is in that last category so it's not what you do one day that kills you it's what you do every
 
 day that k kills you and if you basically eat Ultra processed food high in sugar for 10 years in a row it's going to show up in terms of your comorbidities and ultimately yeah it will kill you and we have the data to show you know how many years you will lose so right now in America we pay an 8ye longevity tax if you look at Japan who uh they have a mean age of death of 88 we have a mean age of 80 okay we're paying an 8-year longevity tax just by living here and we're talking about the healthy people now if you have metabolic
 
 syndrome it's a 15-year longevity tax and uh sorry if you have obesity it's a 15-year longevity taxt and if you have metabolic syndrome it's a 20-year longevity taxt that is primarily not completely but primarily sugar it's also you know Omega sixes it's also so trans fats you know left over because now they're gone but you know people are still suffering the ravages of the trans fats you know from the previous generation are they gone I mean I do remember as a kid when we had margarine in our refrigerator
 
 this is actually a big debate in my home one parent I won't identify which um was Pro margarine the other was Pro butter anti margarine right um the marriage didn't last but there were other reasons that's probably why I went butter um butter butter is fine in fact time declared you know a front cover Butters back you know um margarine was the bad guy without question U and we know now but you know back when we thought it was a calorie was a calorie we thought oh margarine you know it's the same you
 
 know nine calories per gram and we said it lowers your triglycerides bad idea it was because what it did was it lined your liver because you couldn't break that trans double bond and um you know so they're they're now gone from our uh food supply they're illegal they're illegal they're banned but you can make trans fats in your own kitchen by taking olive oil and heating it to beyond the smoking point so they're not completely gone they're just gone from Ultra process food so now sugar is the big problem because of
 
 these three enzymes that you are inhibiting the point is we were we started this with a calorie is a calorie well if you are inhibiting mitochondrial function then a calorie is not a calorie is it you're reducing the um intensity of the Furnace yeah exactly so this whole calories of calorie just makes no sense and it hasn't worked at any level and there is no study that actually shows that cutting calories makes a difference and I can show you you know voluminous data that shows that virtually every way loss study that CA
 
 that led to you know caloric restriction basically didn't work not for any length of time just a round out our earlier discussion because I find it fascinating and I know other people will as well talked about that 160 calories that's actually 130 at the business end of things uh of almonds we talked about the Porter House steak with butter and the 25% reduction in what's actually quote unquote eaten and I'll get back to this because this quote unquote issue I think the problem is there's there's a lack of
 
 useful language to dissociate this stuff yeah you know even just calling fat fat people think it it's going to make you gain body fat totally if we called it adapost tissue and lipids we would have avoided this confusion so I I don't want to get there just yet but I I want to make sure with the food industry does this on purpose really you oh absolutely so they tell you a sugar is a sugar which is not true they tell you a calorie is a calorie which is not true and they tell you a fat is a fat which
 
 is not true okay this is very specifically so when you're talking about sugar you talking about dietary sugar or you talking about blood sugar because blood sugar is blood glucose use dietary cholesterol or circulating cholesterol or you know absolutely yeah okay so we we've done this um you know uh to ourselves but the food industry has really promulgated it because we farmed out nutrition policy and information to the food industry so they actually use this for their purposes it's one of the problems in
 
 this field as we all know quality nutrition influences of course our physical health but also our mental health and our cognitive functioning our memory our ability to learn new things and to focus and we know that one of the most important features of highquality nutrition is making sure that we get enough vitamins and minerals from highquality unprocessed or minimally processed sources as well as enough probiotics and prebiotics and fiber to support basically all the cell functions in our body including the gut microbiome
 
 now I like most everybody try to get optimal nutrition from Whole Foods ideally mostly from minimally processed or nonprocessed Foods however one of the challenges that I and so many other people face is getting enough servings of high quality fruits and vegetables per day as well as fiber and probiotics that often accompany those fruits and vegetables that's why way back in 2012 long before I ever had a podcast I started drinking ag1 and so I'm delighted that ag1 is sponsoring the huberman Lab podcast the reason I
 
 started taking ag1 and the reason I still drink ag1 once or twice a day is that it provides all of my foundational nutritional needs that is it provides insurance that I get the proper amounts of those vitamins minerals probiotics and fiber to ensure optimal mental health physical health and performance if you'd like to try ag1 you can go to drink a1.com huberman to claim a special offer they're giving away five free travel packs plus a year supply of V Vin D3 K2 again that's drink a1.com huberman
 
 to claim that special offer for the third category of macronutrients carbohydrates you differentiated um glucose and fructose MH if I ingest um let's say a half a bagel um since we were talking about New York your city of origin they have great Bagels on the west coast yeah I know it's not the same it's pretty pitiful same with the pizza dough it's like they claim it's the the the water whatever it is it's different back there and it's better indeed half a bagel let's say 250 calories mostly carbohydrate mhm this is an an unlined
 
 un no cream cheese no shmear as they call back there no no cream cheese no butter none that thing just half a bagel 250 calories so that's what I ate you're saying that a calorie eaten is not a calorie eaten how much of that carbohydrate given that it's probably most let's assume it's mostly glucose let's do it this way yeah it is it's polymerized glucose okay polymerized glucose how much of that is actually utilized or burned versus um you know the the original 250 so if you look at what happens to energy in the body
 
 65% of that which is ingested goes to resting energy expenditure just to power the body 10% goes to the thermic effect of food and then 25% goes to activity that's the breakdown of where the uh energy goes and that's calories from fat protein and carbohydrates yeah from everything together and you know glucose is a perfectly good example of how that works the point is though that when you ingest glucose you're getting a big glucose Excursion in your bloodstream so you're getting a big glucose Spike and
 
 that glucose Spike has to come down well what makes it come down the hormone insulin insulin is the bad guy in the story The higher your glucose goes the more your pancreas will release insulin in order to bring that glucose down Well turns out that glucose rise was not benign that glucose rise led to endothelial dysfunction transient but nonetheless endothelial dysfunction could you just um remind people what endothelial cells are the inside of your arteries okay and it will change blood pressure we've got plenty of data to
 
 demonstrate how it changes blood pressure and over time that will cause coronary artery disease that will cause kidney disease Etc but it's the insulin response that is really the bad guy now people think insulin is good because it lowers blood glucose after all diabetics take insulin you know to lower their blood glucose okay let's take a diabetic patient with diabetes blood sugar is 300 that's bad we give them a shot of insulin in the arm blood sugar goes down to 100 blood sugar went from 300 to 100
 
 okay where did the 200 points of blood glucose go I'm assuming that the insulin was sequestered it to where I'm assuming to the liver to the fat interesting for storage that's insulin's job insulin takes whatever you're not burning and puts it into fat for storage insulin is not the diabetes hormone insulin is the energy storage hormone quickly does it do that because because if I'm you know having a a very busy day mhm or that diabetic person is having a very busy day and they're moving around a lot then
 
 you got insulin bound glucose in the bloodstream uh for how long no no insulin doesn't bind glucose insulin binds to its receptor sure sorry sorry and allows for glucose Transporters to work so so but for some period of time while that person is active There's an opportunity to utilize that glucose yeah right um so how quickly is insulin managing that glucose uh we know that the spike comes down quickly but the glucose is not available for energy utilization after what it's or it's it's sequestered to the the adapost to the
 
 fat tissue at within an hour is that about so about 90 minutes yeah but I mean if you're if you're if you're active if you eat uh you know a muffin and you're active Okay your muscles are going to take up that glucose irrespective of in insulin in fact muscles are insulin independent they have glucose Transporters but they are insulin independent because if they weren't then every patient in diabetic keto acidosis would be paralyzed okay so glucose will end up in muscles irrespective of energy status and uh
 
 insulin status and in muscles it's used as immediate Fuel and glycogen both okay metu and glycogen storage okay in the muscle absolutely all right now if you're active then you will clear glucose into muscle Therefore your blood glucose won't rise as much because it went into muscle and therefore your pancreas will put out less insulin because it doesn't have to clear as much from the bloodstream and that's okay that's good right but let's say you didn't exercise so you've got a big glucose Excursion now you have a big
 
 insulin response and that insulin is going to take the excess that's in your blood it has to clear it and it will go to fat for storage that insulin rise turns out to be particularly agrees in terms of metabolic disease and I can prove it there is a mouse my favorite Mouse I love this mouse this mouse turns medicine on its head and teaches every doctor why they have to go back to medical school and learn it right this mouse is called the paduro mouse p d RKO is it discovered by pedco no no it was uh discovered in ronon La
 
 it was manufactured in ronon lab so this is a tissue specific insulin receptor knockout Mouse Okay IR KO insul LAX insulin receptor in specific the kidney in the kidney interco glomular ptoy insulin receptor knockout mous we haven't talked too much about transgenic models and knockins and Knockouts so uh just in 10 seconds or less basically the these are mice that are genetically engineered to lack the receptor for insulin specifically in the glul poite the kidney in the in the kidney and everywhere else in this mouse insulin
 
 does its thing normally exactly great so these animals are ug glycemic normal blood glucose levels these animals are normally glucose tolerant they you know go up they go down just like every other Mouse these mice are not fat these mice are not thin these mice are mice except they have the worst diabetic nephropathy on the planet so they ner oh their kidney is degenerative their kidneys degenerate to nothing yikes now they have normal blood glucose levels they have normal glucose tolerance they have normal insulin
 
 tolerance whole body but their kidneys are dying how come can't be the glucose it's the insulin because insulin is the bad guy insulin's actually making the kidney disease and so these animals that are insulin resistant they have diabetic nephropathy without diabetes so the insulin is having a negative clearly negative effect on the kidneys without binding to the receptor exactly so circulating insulin can do stuff without binding to its receptor well it's no it binds to its receptor in different parts of the body other parts
 
 of the body in the kidney it can't because it's a knockout because it's knockout right the point is insulin does stuff by itself and it turns out insulin drives growth now every cell in your body wants to burn at one time in its life and wants to grow at another time in its life every cell has those two Pathways burning growth burning growth what determines whether a cell should be burning or whether a cell should be growing I don't know what makes it um burning but presumably it's in the has something to do with
 
 mitochondria it has everything to do with mitochondria right so every cell needs to burn and needs to grow at a different time in its life here's a way to think about it we all start out as a zygote a single cell we end up an adult now that single cell had to become two cells those two cells had to become four cells those four cells had to become eight cells and on and on and on and on so every cycle there's a doubling how many doublings to get from a zygote to an adult what's an exponential growth so yeah I don't I
 
 don't know it off the top of my head 41 41 41 two to the 41 doublings gives you an organism 10 trillion cells we're 10 trillion cells we're 10 trillion cells do we know that yeah okay two to the 41 okay okay now of those 41 doublings some of them had to occur in utero some of them had to occur postnatally so I need two numbers that add up to 41 how many in utero how many postnatally well way more you start off with a lot more than you end up with but then you have cells that turn over throughout the lifespan
 
 so this is a tough one okay because skin cells turn over I with neurons it's it's pretty straightforward because you're going to somewhere between three and 10 right well you're and you're born with somewhere between 3 and 10x of what you end up with depending on the brain structure yeah so but whole body wide I don't know how you'd come up put that number 36 and five okay 36 doublings prenatally five doublings postnatally and I can prove that to you too typical baby weighs s pounds first doubling 14
 
 pounds second doubling 20 uh 8B next doubling 56 lb next doubling 112 lb next doubling 224b that's hopefully it's top obes individ hopefully it's tops there not not all people 212 lbs are obese um but some people who are of certain Heights or below are 212 aerobes okay point is the cell has to know when to grow and when to burn it turns out that the signal for that is oxygen because oxygen is necessary for mitochondria to be able to burn in the absence of oxygen the cell only knows how to grow this is actually why OT
 
 warberg won the Nobel Prize in 1931 for the war effect he asked the question how come cancer cells don't need oxygen to grow and the answer is cuz no cell needs oxygen to grow in fact oxygen is the thing that prevents growth famous article from the New England Journal of Medicine 1951 Mount Everest in utero because every fetus is oxygen deprived so normal partial pressure of oxygen 100 millimeters of mercury out here right if if I checked your blood it'd be about 100 right I hope so how about a tumor cell um guessing tumor
 
 cell is probably is it double about 44 wait you just told me partial pressure of of oxygen in a tumor cell it's about 44 but you just told me that well tumor cells which grow like wild right they grow like wild because they don't have oxygen but they but there are some of the so here's what's peculiar about it um tumor cells are some of the most vascularized cells or tumors are are heavily vascular I mean I mean one way to one way to try and kill one is to to devascularize the tumor cell yes and and you know
 
 angiogenesis inhibition Etc you know it's a big deal you know Judah folman and all that from Harvard you know so the excess blood to a tumor is the attempt to bring in oxygen that it's not getting that's right as opposed to delivering lots of oxygen in that's why it's growing that's right okay but a fetus what's the partial pressure in the placenta I don't know 6 to 31 so it's actually like a mile above Mount Everest that's how much oxygen the fetus gets and it's that for that reason that you've got 36 doublings and then as
 
 soon as you're out you know then you cut the cord and you start breathing and now your partial pressure is at 100 that's when growth slows down has there been any effort to treat tumors by oxygenating tumors yes and what does that look like it's hyperbaric oxygen therapy it's a thing oh yeah yeah yeah we we'll probably do an episode on hyperbaric chambers it's the the the reason we haven't yet is it's pretty niche in but there are people who own these things who sit in these things um okay so we got here by way of by way of
 
 car by The Bagel right um so I just want to orient us um that you just that 250 calories of the The Bagel we talked about glucose excursions but it's that insulin rise that's driving the atopos it's also driving the growth okay in the absence of oxygen because if you have oxygen then you don't need that much insulin okay so because you're going to burn instead of store got it in terms of the the uh the raw metabolism of carbohydrate though that glucose if I eat 250 calories of glucose how much of that did I quote unquote
 
 actually eat how much is is used how much is used yeah let's assume that I'm I'm at my desk working or I'm walking around a little bit I'm not I'm not exercising hard in the in the subsequent hour so used for what is the question I'm getting back to the calorie is is the calorie a calorie clearly the answer is no but based on the processing of different types of calories we established it for fat the almonds we established it for protein right the Porter House with butter and now we're we're trying
 
 to establish that for the 250 calories of of bagel which is glucose right so the glucose has to be phosphorated so you're going to lose uh an ATP in the process so you're going to go ATP goes to ADP and then that ADP will go to a denzine monophosphate which will then go to im an ocol monophosphate which will then go to Uric acidd okay and that uric acid will be then released from the cell circulate in the blood and hopefully go out in the kidney in the process that uric acid can inhibit mitochondrial
 
 function and it can also inhibit endothelial nitric oxide synthese which is the enzyme in your vasculature that is your endogenous blood pressure lowerer right by expanding blood vessels and capillaries exactly right this is the mechanistic uh foundation of the drugs that were originally used for uh improving prostate function but are used to treat itile dysfunction which are the the PD Inhibitors which allow nitric oxide to be uh around longer and more of it right people use it for other purposes too now no one will forget if I
 
 queue it up with that that example well we we uh you know in the neonatal Intensive Care Unit it closes Paton ductus arteriosis which is a big deal in uh in the uh neonatal uh uh World okay I I want to ask you about that but but um so I heard two things one is that um glucose and the insulin that goes with it increases uric acid mhm uric acid uh while it has certain important functions in health too much of it you said Can inhibit nitric oxide yeah can inhibit nitric oxide so that means that the
 
 blood vessels and capillaries are going to stay more constricted so blood pressure is going to be higher than it would be normally that's right and then uric acid is also inhibiting mitochondrial function that's right okay um but eating half a bagel isn't necessarily a terrible thing if it's within your caloric requirements it and it it all depends on how much uh you clear and how high your insulin goes now let's compare that 250 calories of glucose to 250 calories of fructose right uh let's let's come up with a food
 
 example 250 calories of fructose would be trivial to uh consume in the form of high fructose corn syrup right so remember that high fructose corn syrup is half glucose half fructose 125 125 so let's use that well so let's assume um so we talk about a soda for uh to get that that uh 250 calories easily right um especially if it's not a can or a European siiz bottle or can 8 o 8 O can of soda okay so 8 oz can of soda um and maybe let's include a food item let's talk like a store-bought packaged cookie
 
 couple Oreos two Oreos okay probably get you to that 250 or maybe four Oreos maybe three Oreos yeah okay um Oreo lovers everywhere celebrating three 250 calories of fructose what's the effect on uric acid what's the effect on caloric burn what's the effect on anything for that matter that uh we should be aware of all right so first of all the Oreo has plenty of fructose in it so keep that in mind okay the um if let's say you consumed uh 250 calories in a bagel because that's pretty much polymerized glucose versus

D238	https://youtu.be/99Y4-ki1SIg?si=i_hiT8YAE15TcGBr	relating to someone who went through the same or at least something very similar than yourself is often the biggest step you can take towards anxiety recovery and finding the courage to take that leap of faith that you will inevitably need to take when you embark on the recovery journey and that is because if you don't find someone that you can really truly relate to or had similar experiences than yourself then it often feels like your anxiety is the worst case that your symptoms are way too severe to be just anxiety or that what  you are experiencing is just way too intense to Simply Be only anxiety and exactly for this reason I want to share with you my story of what kind of symptoms I dealt with the emotions I went through and the processes I had to learn to overcome during my anxiety days and if hearing other people's anxiety stories and symptoms is triggering for you then you might want to tune off from this one I have dealt with truly debilitating anxiety for around 5 years and it all started with that first panic attack that first panic attack had me  genuinely believe that I was having a heart attack or at least was on the verge of having a heart attack that panic attack started because my fingers on my left hand went kind of numb not really numb like I was confused if they were numb or sensitive if that makes any sense I didn't think too much of it so but I just constantly was in in thought in my fingers touching them trying to feel what is going on it was like I was completely chained by this by this sensation I couldn't get rid of this thought so these thoughts kept popping  up getting more intense more intense more intense and with that the sensation itself became more intense and that's when I slowly started to worry and I opened up a window on Google and typed in numb fingers on the left side and you can imagine left side numbness you won't find something nice on Google there so that's why I never Google your symptoms so I was eagerly going through all the pages all the sites and and and you can imagine everything on there was just negative scary there was almost no  mention of anxiety I guess there was no mention of anxiety at all it was all heart attack stroke I don't know some nerve damage whatever so yeah that's when I really felt like the adrenaline rushing in my head I could feel like these waves of fear hitting me it's weird Sensations like adrenaline was injected into my brain so I started having this debate this internal debate if I should like Get Up and Scream for help call for an ambulance or wait it out and see if it go away by itself but of course the symptoms became much worse  suddenly I had like these heart flutters and my chest became tighter my breathing became unnatural like very shallow and that numbness in my fingers turned into like a stabbing feeling that started here from my elbow going down to the fingers and also like a kind of pulling sensation here on my nerves it was weird so in that moment I was just mentally pacing and racing around with my thoughts trying to figure out what to do but eventually I got to the point where I had to physically stand up and was  pacing up and down the office really really trying to figure out the best solution for my situation I was not 100% convinced I was having a heart attack but also not 100% convinced I was okay it was like this inner battle should I should I not should I should I not am I going to embarrass myself or not that went on and on and on until eventually the symptoms just intensified and multiplied so much that I had to call someone and had to ask them to call the ambulance for me and this is the moment  where you hear a lot of people say that they slowly Cal calmed down and felt embarrassed because they called an ambulance and now they feel fine they they noticed it was just anxiety but I never arrived at that stage throughout all the 3 to 5 hours of waiting for the nurses to do the tests waiting for the test results waiting for the doctor I was on that stretcher really genuinely thinking I was about to die I kept getting these waves of anxi xiety and really proper fear and I curled myself up and tensed all my muscles because it  felt like this could somehow protect me from all the symptoms I was feeling and I can remember how I was just holding my father's hand on that bed my eyes wide open and really in Terror thinking this is it this is the day I'm going to die and you know what then happened the doctor came gave me a benzo pill told me it was anxiety gave me three more for for the next day and told me I should rest and that's it I maybe heard two sentences from the doctor didn't explain what was happening didn't say what was  going on just said anxiety and sent me back home so that was the solution from the doctor for a half day full of anxiety really believing I was going to die full of symptoms and really proper Terror and in my mind I just couldn't believe that somebody could look me in the eyes for like 10 seconds and simply say it's anxiety so that was a big big problem already from the first day and I luckily never saw that doctor again okay but to be be fair with that knowledge or that doctor telling me that I was fine  it's just stress I was kind of relieved so my dad drove me home I kind of I think I fainted out I fainted in bed like slept slept at 7:00 p.m. and woke up kind of feeling okay I still had that mental image of that panic attack and that fear of the previous day in my head but I thought that now that I knew it was just anxiety I should be fine nothing will happen well of course I was wrong symptoms started popping up again fear and Terror were raging in my head once again but this time it was different because this time I actually  knew it was anxiety I knew what anxiety could do to you at least to the extent that WebMD describes anxiety and I got that reassurance from the doctor before that it was stress but still I was getting all these Sensations and feelings and so in my mind it meant that this time it couldn't be anxiety it couldn't be a panic attack it had to be something more serious it had to be a real physical illness so there there I was once again in the middle of a busy street in Hong Kong really begging my father to call me an ambulance because  this time this time it is a heart attack this time it is the big one this time it is the real thing the real deal my Dad tried to convince me that it's just stress and panic but I didn't believe him cuz everything I was feeling was just too real back then I couldn't even imagine that anxiety can create these real Sensations and feelings so I really begged him to get me that amb which he eventually did but again everything came back fine I was okay and this cycle keep repeating over and over and over again I don't know how many  times I called the ambulance throughout the years I don't know how many times I went to the doctor throughout the years but it was just a constant repetition of getting panic attacks or feeling Sensations and symptoms and finding that reassurance from doctors which gave me some relief I always return back to being that anxious ball of symptoms if that makes sense so just a few weeks after that first panic attack I was completely consumed by my anxiety not really by the anxiety I was consumed by  the symptoms and feelings I was experiencing everywhere on my body and I really felt so hopeless because nobody could figure out what was going on with me I mean that's at least how I felt of course people told me it was anxiety but that didn't go into my head for me it was not anxiety it was a physical thing that just nobody could catch or nobody could figure out what it was so I was so consumed by the phys physical symptoms that I really spent days or even weeks researching a specific sensation so that  I really believe I was more knowledgeable on that specific disease than some other doctors out there that is how deep I was into my research how deep I was into my quest of getting to the bottom of it all this this Quest This research pretty much fored my entire life there was all left to it I couldn't do anything else my brain wouldn't let me do anything else there were actually only two parts left in my life on the one side I was pretty much waiting for that one big blow to strike me down and kill me off so to say and on  the other side I was kind of racing towards finding a solution finding the key of why I was feeling the way I did maybe there was a certain disease that nobody knew of or somebody in my age had like a million to one chance of having and the doctors didn't pay attention to that that was what I was looking for it was kind of a Time game in my head I thought if if I don't do something now something bad is going to happen later and you can imagine how much stress that causes to your mind and body and  basically everything so progressively the symptoms got worse and they didn't only pop up when the anxiety was high or I was feeling specifically stressed now the symptoms or plenty of the symptoms were there 24/7 for days weeks or even months on end without a break some of the symptoms that were with me pretty much all the time were the nist which started in my fingers now spread to like the side of my neck and my calves and also I had like burning sensation here in my uh here on my forearm and on my uh  quads I also felt lightheadedness and sometimes I got like this blurry sensation in my vision where everything seemed kind of Milky and dream like that was something that was with me really for I don't know the better part of 2 years and also my body turned into like a ball of ache like my muscles were tense pretty much everywhere I couldn't get my mind not to think about how hurtful my body is how tense my neck is how hurtful my Cal calves are the the entire day I would just be like stretching my neck massaging my  shoulders rolling around on the floor popping my bones so with all these Sensations happening to me I started going or seeking out specialists in certain Fields like a neurologist cardiologist what you call it virologist a chiropractor some kind of herbs specialist I got CT scans x-rays MRI scans from the brain everything you can think of I pretty much did but nothing really helped me nothing gave me relief or took some of the fear away from me at least not for long I always returned back to the anxious ball and so I always  went back to my quest to finding a solution not for anxiety but for a physical illness of course because back then I thought that if I got a specific number of tests if I scanned every every part of my body if I if my blood was tested for all these certain diseases and cancer markers if I pretty much got everything covered then I could accept it was anxiety without knowing 100% everything is clear there was no chance for me to to even start believing that this could be anxiety in my brain what I was  feeling was way too intense to be anxiety so that was always like a second thought for me so in my mind the game was kind of solving a gigantic puzzle like if I would have all the pieces together and made them perfectly match then I would get the picture then I would see clearly what is happening to me so that was my mission at this stage I was a little bit more than a year into the whole anxiety experience and here it got so much worse quite quickly because at some point I was even having like  this mental self debate if I would rather die from a heart attack or cancer and I came to the conclusion that cancer will be better because then I could prepare myself for death I could say goodbye to my loved ones I could prepare a will and that will I actually did draft up did write and told everyone where they could find it in case of my inevitable passing and mind you I was 25 26 back then and just a year before all my thoughts or worries were which party to go how many drinks to have and how to  meet girls that was my life before that but now I was this highly sensitized young man that would be triggered by the slightest wind like hitting me here on my neck that was a little bit unexpected maybe a window was open somewhere in the office lights changing or flashing when entering from one room to the other would set me off in a panic mode cuz I was confused if my eyes were failing me or if it actually was the light someone unexpectedly knocking at the door I would be spiraling in thoughts my  clothes like rubbing here or rubbing in my calves when walking around made me think of numbness like I wasn't sure if that was my clothes rubbing my skin or my skin giving me wrong signals telling me that there's something wrong and overall I would just be getting the weirdest Sensations like I would get these cut-like Sensations here my chest that really felt like somebody took like a razor blade small razor blade gave me like small little Cuts everywhere here this under the arms on the legs and the  worst ones were like these ice Pig headaches ice pick headaches I felt like somebody took a big ice pick and poked it right into my my brain like the all my my entire brain would be just flashing up and I also would be getting these uh brain zaps that felt like my brain was off for just a second like like when I was walking around it felt like I was just about to faint and then my brain would be backfiring up keeping me awake you know like you know the feeling when you're in bed and sometimes you dream that somebody's throwing a  ball and you get this shock feeling that's what I used to get like every five 5 minutes and especially when trying to sleep these brain Zs would keep me up all night long and this is also where the anxiety took away more and more from my life I couldn't even watch TV or watch a show anymore because something exciting or disgusting would trigger me would trigger symptoms I couldn't concentrate on a book anymore because my brain was never really there I was always scanning my body like my brain was always looking inwards trying  to get ready for action in case that big blow does eventually pop up so I was always on edge always waiting for that thing to happen also eating eventually became something I dreaded because thinking of fats thinking of unhealthy food made me kind of cringe so I only could eat very clean stuff like salads and chicken breast everything else would get my brain into hyperdrive thinking about how the fat would be clogging my arter iies and making me more prone to that inevitable heart attack or stroke  for example also hot shower is were a risk factor for me now because the heat would be too much for my heart to handle getting up too fast from bed or from a chair another risk factor because that would raise my blood pressure and maybe maybe a blood cloth could then be released into my bloodstream and blocking my vein to the brain yeah these were the thoughts constantly in my brain all the time 24/7 7 round and round and round and went and besides that I was also constantly checking my face like  was everything in place was everything there which should be could I even tell if I was having a stroke if everything is there where it should be was my brain capable of analyzing correctly so yes the fight or flight mode really did its best to keep me safe and tried really to figure out every possible scenario of danger and the longer I dealt with anxiety the less panic attacks I would get eventually towards the end I wouldn't get any panic attacks at all but that didn't mean that my life was better because the symptoms would get  much more I can't even say that symptoms got much more just my entire body was like One symptom everything hurt everything was out of place everything didn't feel right so wherever I checked and I always checked something didn't feel correct it was like my body was slowly withering away and there was nothing I could do it was at this stage where I often crawled into my par in's bed and had to hold my mom's hand for to find some sleep not because I wanted to feel Comfort but because I wanted her to  feel when my body went cold or feel when I had a seizure or something it was another safety behavior that I developed over time I always needed to be sure that I covered every aspect of danger possible and these were the ones what I consider where I have hit rock bottom for the past 5 years I tried really everything to unveil the disease not anxiety the physical disease which I was certain I was having nobody could find anything I couldn't research my way out of it I couldn't get a test that showed  that something was wrong nobody really cared nobody could help me and so I gave up hope I laid down my quest and gave up I really told myself to effort and give up if it happens it happens if it's a serious disease then what can I do if it's anxiety Then well at least now I'm living and working towards a life I can be proud of at some point instead of withering away I just simply really had enough but this is not the video about my recovery Journey which you can find I think here somewhere but I do hope that  sharing my story kind of helped you gain some trust in your anxiety diagnosis and that you now genuinely can believe that anxiety can create the craziest and scariest symptoms and also the most debilitating emotions and feelings and I hope it gives you the courage to take that leap of faith and also say eff it and start regaining bits of your life back 
P238	https://youtu.be/1pTdTYpvhFk?si=Ri94Iky1-1QO-YDr	so today we're going to teach you how to diagnose the inside of your body your health using your face but i need to tell you something how can i put this you don't want to start diagnosing your friends especially your family especially your spouse using what i'm about to teach you the worst thing you can do with other people is basically to tell them what their problems are unless you know they're paying you like in practice for 30 years or they ask you so use this information on yourself because the last thing i  want you to do is to start to explain to your spouse hey honey i just learned why you have a round face and why you have bags underneath your eyes and you have scaly rough skin and then you mentioned dr berg in the same sentence bad idea don't do it and it's bad manners and it's just you're asking for a fight so use this information for yourself all right so let's take a look at what's going on here let's say you're balding right usually a loss of hair on the top part of your head means you have too much dht dht is a very  powerful form of testosterone that is occurring because there's this enzyme that is converting testosterone into dht at a higher level than it should be and so what you want to do is you want to reduce this enzyme by taking certain inhibitors okay and those inhibitors come in pumpkin seeds green tea and zinc will help you lower this enzyme to help lower dht i have a lot more information on this but i'm going to give you the the big overview and the concepts not the specifics all right so if you're losing your eyebrows on the  outer part that is a hypothyroid issue slow thyroid you might need some iodine okay next thing is bloodshot eyes that's usually a liver problem now it could be that you got drunk the night before and you have a hangover and you have bloodshed eyes but it's either something related to the liver that is usually coming from your diet i've noticed in the past not recent past a long time ago when i ate poorly a lot of junk food my eyes were always bloodshot so bloodshy eyes mean stress in the liver but it can also mean  especially if it's red on the inside of your eyelids you have a blood sugar problem okay you're eating too many carbs i used to have that and you can also feel like sandpaper too so if there's irritability on the inside of your eyelids suspect you have insulin problems you have insulin resistance and you're pre-diabetic or heading in that direction now i am going to cover um what's behind dry eyes in a little bit so let's go on to the next one darkened circles underneath the eyes if you have these dark circles  that is a pigment problem coming from insulin resistance a lot of diabetics have this and they also get dark in pigments in different places in the body different folds and their armpits on their neck that comes from high levels of insulin which is affecting melanin in the body okay so if you have darkened circles underneath the eyes there it's what you have to do is you have to get on healthy keto and do intermittent fasting to help produce this insulin resistance situation now let's flip right over here  to these bags beneath the eyes okay if you get these like this swollen uh tissue underneath the eye or or even on top of the eye this is either a blood sugar issue same thing or there's something going on with the kidney now the thing that destroys the kidney more than anything is high levels of sugar so it does relate to insulin resistance because the kidney is one organ that gets hammered with a high carb diet but there's other causes of kidney problems as well but if the kidney is backed up with  fluid you'll see it underneath the eye it'll just be swollen now let's kind of go through this side here oily skin that means that your oil glands sebaceous glands are pumping out too much oil because your androgens are too high and if you're male you need more zinc to help regulate the amount of estrogen now if you're female it could also mean that you need more zinc but usually if you have too much androgen in your female you have something called polycystic ovarian syndrome and you might have other  additional symptoms like facial hair acne which is high levels of androgen which is coming from this insulin okay high levels of insulin because the carbs are too high are you starting to see a common thread so far a high carbohydrate diet also depletes zinc allowing the antigens to go higher if you are a female so there's a lot of issues with skin related to insulin oily skin acne and the list goes on okay let's talk about cataracts cataracts occur when the lens of the eye becomes opaque and you can no longer see  through it and the lens is very very sensitive to oxidation and where would you get oxidation you can get it from you know looking into the sun you can get it from chemicals you can get it from taking steroids and other medication but a very common cause would be if you're consuming a high carb diet this is why the incidence of getting a cataract if you're a diabetic is very very high also if you're deficient in vitamin a you're more susceptible to cataracts what happens when you eat a lot of carbs  without the antioxidants without the protective mechanism you get a lot of free radical damage you get a lot of oxidation and you have symptoms you might have peripheral neuropathy in your feet you might have cataracts you might have problems with the retina you might have problems with your heart so there's a very good remedy if you're starting to get cataracts to help reverse it vitamin b1 in the form of a fat-soluble version which is called ben photome that acts as a powerful antioxidant to help counter the  collateral damage from the high level of blood sugars if you're a diabetic so vitamin b1 as benfotamine will greatly help slow down and possibly reverse cataracts there's some other things you can take to that can act as a very powerful antioxidant nac drops okay it comes in a liquid you take that you put in your eyes and it helps to protect all the free radical damage that's occurring all right the next thing is red cheeks okay so you have these like either rosacea or red cheeks you see they're quite common  you see this in cushing's syndrome cushing's syndrome is a high level of cortisol okay that person is under a lot of stress and that's one of the symptoms but the treatment for red cheeks medically is giving a person an antibiotic now why would an antibiotic work for red cheeks well obviously there's some type of microbial imbalance going on why not give the person a natural antibiotic like garlic oregano thyme wormwood extract sage there's a lot of different herbs you can take as a natural antibiotic and  then give the person probiotics what's the best probiotic sauerkraut because it has the prebiotic and the probiotic but you can also take probiotics as a supplement but it's been very effective to help this redness in the cheeks now if someone has either a gray or brownish pigmentation on the cheek that's something a little different it's called melasma and melasma is an estrogen problem you're taking too much estrogen or you're being exposed to too much estrogen either in a birth control pill or some type of hormone  replacement therapy or it could be coming from exposure to you know a lot of plastics in the environment or certain chemicals that can mimic estrogen so if this is you what you want to do is you want to take something that can actually oppose that or help clean it up and dim is a good remedy which is a concentrated form of cruciferous or start to consume more cruciferous foods or iodine in the form of sea kelp can help balance estrogen now what about all this this scaly peeling type flaky skin that you get around the nose  okay or in the ear okay what is that that is a combination of low omega-3 fatty acids and high omega-6 fatty acids normally you want a one-to-one ratio very few people have that ratio there's a really good test that you can do you can actually they send you a kit and i'll put a link down below but they send you a kit you take a drop of your blood you send it off and they can tell you your ratios of how much omega-3 versus how much omega-6 and quite a few people have a severe imbalance and they're just really heavy  on the six and low on the three so that means they need to consume more cod liver oil fatty fish to bring these back in balance but if you have this imbalance you'll have rough scaly skin dermatitis a lot of skin issues inflammation of the skin dry eyes and dry hair now what foods are high in omega-6 chicken and fried foods as in fried in corn oil soy oil canola oil those type of oils which are very high in the omega-6 range including peanut oil as well now safflower oil and sunflower oil are also  omega-6 but they're much better because they're not gmo however you don't want to consume a lot of them a little bit here and there is going to be fine but most people just need to dramatically increase their omega 3 fatty acids if you're a vegan you can get your omega-3 from algae and some other sources like that also nuts and nut butters like in peanut butter in grains are very high in six low in three this is why cows that are fed grains don't have the right ratios of omega-3 to omega-6. same thing with other  animals that are meant to consume grass but typically a lot of teenagers you know they eat junk food they don't eat a lot of vegetables they don't eat fish they don't eat cod liver oil they have skin issues okay they have a lot of skin issues you'll see it around here a lot of times they will have also oily skin they'll have acne and so they can clean this up if they have this knowledge boy when i was a teenager i had a lot of these issues and i wished i had someone to actually tell me what to do and give me the correct knowledge so  i wouldn't have to go through that what we're looking at is a lot of different symptoms and indicators that give clues to help us pull the string to see what's behind it but unfortunately when you look up each one of these symptoms online especially on the first five pages of google you're going to find a lot of medical type recommendations medications creams and they're not going to tell you the deeper causes all right let's talk about blackheads blackheads it's a simple vitamin d deficiency if  you're low in vitamin d you get blackheads okay so get some more sun watch my video on how to create your own vitamin d supplement from mushrooms exposing it to sun or take it as a supplement okay cracked corners of your mouth right here and i i've had that i've had a lot of these symptoms in the past okay cracks that's a b2 deficiency vitamin b2 prevents the liver from becoming damaged it does a lot of other things as well but one thing it will do it affects the skin and it creates fissures okay and those fissures or  cracks also can cause chap lips and also can cause cracked heels on the back of your heels you'll get these little cracks that's a b2 deficiency coming from consuming too much refined flour usually okay and that would be in the form of like breads pasta cereal crackers biscuits pancakes things like that now when you see coal sores okay that is herpes simplex one that is a virus and the best way to put that thing back in remission is to take a natural herb or or something that is anti-viral like  garlic like zinc but there's been some great data on fasting periodic prolonged fasting that can help get rid of certain viruses the problem with viruses is a lot of these viruses stay in your body and they go into a dormant state and they wait until your immune system is weak and they come out and kick you when you're down when you get older when you're nutritionally deficient and especially when you go through stress one of the biggest stresses that causes viruses to come out of remission is losses  so sooner or later we're all going to experience losses people around us that we love we're going to lose them and so that stress can really hit the body and cause these viruses to come out of remission in fact a lot of autoimmune diseases also are triggered by severe stress in the form of losses so that is one area that you don't see a lot of information but i've seen it in my practice almost one for one i always ask people what happened right before you got this autoimmune disease or what happened  right before you got sick or had this virus come out of remission and there's usually always some type of stress event or some type of loss okay facial hair okay we talked about that a female that means too much androgens could be polycystic ovarian syndrome and the way that you get too much androgens is by having too much insulin so again the common theme is to go low carb and not eating so frequently as in doing intermittent fasting all right acne i already mentioned this but both females and males it's too much  androgens now it could be too much estrogen as well but typically it's going to be too much androgen and that usually comes from too much insulin now other things can cause acne too like drinking milk but it's not as common as this insulin problem right and so what you need to do is you just need to get off the carbs clean up the diet and this acne will go away but the acne is a real good indicator on what's going on with someone's diet but boy i wish i would have known what to do back in high school when i had bad acne because  it can be devastating all right last point you can see this little line here a round face i'm gonna put up a picture of when my son got married you can see the shape of my head was roundish compared to now that was because i was on a so-called healthy diet but that healthy diet include apples as snacks with peanut butter i wasn't eating like completely junk food but i was eating fruit and i was having a lot of snacks so if you have a brown face and you want to kind of strip off some of the fat or the  puffiness and handle a lot of these other issues you get on a healthy keto diet you stop snacking you do intermittent fasting and if you are new to my channel i have two very simple videos to watch in a row and i put them up right here check it out 
V242	https://www.youtube.com/live/BIPcfIaVweQ?si=7Jne0dP1EL2Wq-9B	[Music] Christ is risen indeed he is risen Allelujah thank you for joining us today on the Catholic Family News Channel my name is Matt gaspers I'm the managing editor of CFN and it's been a while since I've been on here with you all I I haven't hosted a show since my leave of absence at the end of 2023 so I'm very glad to be back and I'm especially excited to have our very special guest today with us father Chad Ripper welcome father thank you very much for having me Matt we've been trying to do this for a while
 
 so I'm glad we're finally getting it done absolutely I've been looking forward to this um many of you I'm sure know father riper for those who may not he's very well known for his work in the field of exorcism he's the superior of a a relatively new order it's been around for how long now father about 12 years yeah okay that's what I was thinking so it's called the uh Society of the most sorrowful mother it's also known they're also known as the doin fathers they are SE a semic contemplative order that are
 
 focused on the work of exorcism um but a lot of people don't realize that father riper also has a lot of expertise in the area of mental health he wrote a uh very easy read right father kind of a weekend read home people make it through it I'm impressed introduction to the science of mental health it's it's only it's a little under 700 Pages you can get it done in a weekend right yeah it's shorter it's shorter than my book diabolic influence which is technically speaking um volume four of that series
 
 oh my and uh it's only 828 Pages yeah that's right very easy reading so seriously it's a it's a very good a very dense work really meant for I think healthc Care Professionals if I recall correctly and just full disclosure I have not made it through the entire text I have um you know gone around bits and pieces and I have some quotes to share with you all today during the interview but I'm looking forward to discussing the topic of mental health wounds and healing which I think is something we need to hear more about uh especially in
 
 Catholic circles traditional catholic circles in particular and father is here to help us understand these topics more deeply and he has a lot of experience helping people with these so thank you for being here father before we get into it would you mind beginning with a prayer sure in the name of the father son and holy spirit amen direct oh Lord all our actions by thy holy Inspirations and carry them on by thy gracious assistance what every prayer and work of ours may begin from thee and by thee be
 
 happening through Christ Our Lord amen amen virgin most prudent pray for us in the name of the father son and the holy spirit amen amen if you've read the whole book you know why I Ed virgin most prudent but any yes I do know the reference to that actually from uh minion that's the other book that we're going to be talking about today one yep the nature of of spiritual warfare all right so before we get into the interview questions I just wanted to share real briefly father and I actually first met I think it was in mid 2017
 
 right around the time that I first started with CFN and father and his community had just moved to the town that I live in actually grey Colorado in the arch dasis of Denver because Archbishop Aquilla invited them into the arch dases to to operate do their work here so it's been a pleasure it's been a very great blessing to get to know father over these years and very excited to be doing this interview now so maybe father before we start into the uh the mental health and healing questions can you just share a little about your path
 
 to the priesthood and how you became interested in this subject of mental health I'm not sure I've ever heard you talk about that yeah actually I never have I mean it's I I've virtually never talked about my vocation situation I mean my first inclination that I had at vocation was when I was four actually I was oh wow I was at Mass with my mom all my other siblings had gone back to school I was the youngest and so my mom decided to go back start going back to daily mass because that was something
 
 that she always had done up until she had six kids right so then she had didn't have the opportunity so she went back to mass and while I was at Mass when she went up to communion because in that day you didn't come up to communion unless you actually received Holy Communion and it was still at the altar rail because we were it was still pretty conservative where I was at because the pastor we had was a uh an old Irish uh praised by the name of father granon who was um grumpy but Orthodox and as solid
 
 as they come right so he was like a fantastic Pastor to grow up under he was also a vocations machine he had 18 guys enter the Seminary out of his Parish wow while he there and this was in Wyoming right that's where you're from yeah so this was in Wyoming so i s when he was giving out communion at the communion rail one point time the thought just occurred to me so I'm four years old what I want to do and then from that point on it was pretty clear I did do some dating but it was kind of one of
 
 those things just like it conflicted with what I know I supposed to do so I was always miserable so I decided okay I got to really pursue this so then I um entered the Seminary right out of the it was it was very unorthodox so then I decided to go to this um to uh and actually it was at the Seminary that I first started uh actually taking classes uh I mean even though my primary focus was on philosophy I started taking classes uh in the area of psychology at that point and so then so time time frame like
 
 year-wise when when was this roughly uh this would have been 1983 okay 83 to 84 and then after that I realized because this is an orthodox I needed an orthodox education so I went to the um to the University of San Francisco this is San Francisco this is when father fesio was there but the philosophy Department there was excellent so I focused on philosophy knowing that's what I was going to need but it's in those first four years I began to realize that the anthropology that under girds the psychology was a
 
 problem so I started really focusing more on um understanding um you know the psychology side of it but then also understanding theistic to mytic anthropology side of it so that I could get a better sense of it and I began to realize that the and just watching you know I would just watch people who would go to therapist and then just the amount of success was practically nil I mean and and so I realized okay there's something wrong but anyway that all being said so it's during that time and then I did a masters in philosophy at
 
 the um Center for teristic studies at the University of St Thomas in Houston then I went back into the Seminary joined the fraternity became ordained for them and then they sent me on to get a doctorate in philosophy and so I focused on um an area of um intellectually how we actually are able to know what we're doing morally but that also fit in with the psychological side of things then once I was ordained that's when I decided okay now I'm going to start writing the book originally I wrote three volumes but now they're in
 
 that one volume which you showed people right right so there's just one volume there now that Co that covers basically it's a foundational work to give people an understanding of it we've had recently in about the last five years the sales of it and stuff are really increasing um and we're also getting an um right we've already trained close to 100 50 Catholic psychologists around the country in theistic approach because they realize wonderful yeah because they said they realize they need to understand what the anthropology is
 
 because they see a problem most of them are actually pretty decent therapists because they're just using basic common sense but now they wanted a foundation for it and so we're uh we train a lot of them we actually do this as part of the training for those the Mental Health Care Professionals who are going to actually assist us in doing Diagnostics of people who would either be possessed um or it's psychological illness and so we're trying to develop a group around the country um and so we're making some
 
 progress so it's it's starting to pick up some steam which is good that's very good I'm just going to share on my screen real quick here so people can see all of Father's books are available at census uh traditionis press which is uh senen Trad press.com should be on the screen right now so you can see you can find out there's a great book I have my copy of Deliverance prayers here I've been meaning to get a new one because the spine unfortunately broke and and pages are falling out so but that sign that I
 
 use it right so yeah all right let me take that off the screen here so yeah you mentioned in some of your response the difference between and you talk about this in one of your books in your book on Mental Health one of the fundamental misunderstandings you say of M modern psychology relates to its material object namely the human intellect it is because modern psychology has departed from a proper understanding of man's ontological Constitution that it has not had much success in curing modern man's
 
 psychological illnesses so could you maybe break down for us what's the what is the the Paradigm of modern psychology as far far as their anthropology and how does it differ from a t mistic realist understanding of man uh I think the pr fundamental difference is that uh in most modern psychological approaches especially in the old psychological schools but even in when you um look at the literature even now that it's being that's being put out there is a basic attitude that man anthropologically is or in an
 
 ontological way we would say in his being is purely a material thing right so they would not say that there's any immaterial thing like the soul or as I talk about in the book um from the time of Aristotle on there was a recognition that there were faculties of the soul that were that operated independently of matter part of it is it the intellect so the intellect is actually three-fold but um so part of the intellect is material right and so uh which we'll be talking about during the course of this
 
 interview but it's it's material the other part is immaterial which is so the ability of self-reflection the act of conscience um the uh the ability to understand truth and grasp truth and Beauty those are something that's actually done um on an immaterial level it's not done through a bodily organ it it requires a bodily organ to for the image in order to begin that process but there's certain things and then also of course Free Will is something that operates independently of matter because if free will if the will was actually
 
 part of the matter it would be determined by physical laws and so it wouldn't be truly free and so we have free will that's our experience that we can choose between goods Etc so there's certain operations in theistic understanding of things that operate independently of matter and it's precisely those differences than that give us an understanding of um uh the differences between the two and what's happened is is by focusing purely on human beings as a material thing they haven't fully grasped um you know Free
 
 Will certain um activities of the human uh the human individual and as a result of that they've had their success has been somewhat limited I should say that historically things are shifting though in the last 10 to 15 years there is um a shift that started to happen so we went from the the originally we there was basically philosophical schools like freudianism uh Union psychology and things like that but those began to wne because they just weren't working and so a lot of the people started in Psychology started
 
 taking a more scientific approach so it was trial and error you know which is basically the the uh empirical method and so they began to take a more uh scientific approach toward it and so was that like the behavioralist school BF Skinner kind of stuff or is that he was yeah he was the the guy that was kind of starting that going trying to go down that path I think um but he's he's usually considered one of the general schools but a lot of his stuff is actually a lot of the stuff that he talks about is actually valid it just
 
 has to be understood as being limited and not giving a full understanding of it there's are some false conclusions that he does arrive at but generally there's some stuff in there that is legitimate um but the point being is is that uh then we went through kind of a scientific pH or a a u a more uh empirical phase where they just was tiled and trusted then we went through a kind of a medical phase um which is more of a psychiatric phase where they started just medicating People based on what they had discovered in certain
 
 things in brain science right and then and now we're starting to shift back out of that a way um where it's kind of more of a recognition of the medical model has its own limitations and so now we're shifting back to a more um uh there's a desire for people to actually discover a more full anthropology so all these things can be good together the good stuff that from each of these things can be gleaned off and used and then the stuff that's not that's where they don't have the proper understanding or a
 
 fuller understanding can be used then to see these things in the context and actually help people with psychological um illnesses so we've actually the people that actually use theistic approach which is the one that I um kind of lay out in this book um their success rate is pretty high um as far as um when you're talking about people whose problem is not psychiatric in nature but that it's just something where psychologically they just have to process stuff they have uh one psychologist that I actually used to
 
 work with but unfortunately his health kind of declined and so he's not able to do the work anymore was had had about an 80% success rate which was pretty high so based upon just taking the theistic model that is wonderful I mean I'm sure something else that's obviously lacking in the modern secular psychology model is is divine revelation obious you know the fact that we that the the fall of Adam and Eve is real it's not just a myth and that it had real effects on human nature all that kind of stuff yes absolutely yeah
 
 that we're pro because of original sin we have darkness of the intellect weakness of the will or malice actually in the will weakness of the in our What's called the rasal appetite that's the when engages things are difficult and then concupisent right we just have these Tendencies and and also those are also the same categories um which was ironically because we kind of started this out with this but that those were called the the wounds of original sin right because they're were messed up as a result of this and it's the same thing
 
 in relationship to our actual sin so um so Revelation did actually give man a pro uh kind of a an initial understanding of psychologically how we work you know this is what this is what's going on this is why we're a mess even Aristotle one time said there's something fundamentally wrong with human beings because we grasp what is right but we're our the our lower faculties are disordered so he said there's something wrong with us right and obviously he didn't have an understanding of of original sin but he
 
 was seeing the effects of it yes that's amazing I didn't I wasn't aware of that that's really cool um so you you mentioned a little bit ago about the difference between the the immaterial part of the intellect and the material part and one thing I did read in your book which was very helpful is you Define mental health as quote a quality residing in the possible intellect which if I understand correctly is man's highest cognitive faculty which is immaterial as you said correct but you also recognize in your book that uh
 
 physiological causes for example brain chemistry can be at play when it comes to mental illness including things like depression right maybe you could talk a little about the relationship between the immaterial part of the intellect and the material part and how they interact with each other yeah so um uh hopefully I won't talk too long if I do just shut me up but uh but it's uh so basically we have the lower faculties which include uh things like our imagination our memory um a thing called the cogitative power
 
 that's the ability to make associations um and we know that this is actually something done at the level of the brain because when the plaque builds up although recently they're saying um in because I do keep up somewh with the the brain science they're starting to think that it's actually not the plaque on the neurons that actually causes the blockage and the being able to remember a relationship to uh to alzheimer's they think it might be a protein issue more than anything else but that that all
 
 being said the plaque builds up on the neurons and that blocks the cogitative powers ability to access memory so we can't this is why we can't um when somebody walks into the room we can't make the associations from the past and being able to recognize them and so but it has that power of Association you know the whole um advertisement industry in our country is based on this power of Association and that's where behavioralism kind of recognize certain aspects of these associations but it didn't have a fuller understanding of it
 
 like the like St Thomas did so those are the kind of lower faculties but then also there is um our emotions which also work through which work through a bodily organs so those are something we experience physically so those are on the lower levels then there is um once the image is prepared sufficiently for abstraction people can read about what that means in my book but once that happens at the level of the brain then what happens is then the higher faculty is able to abstract out of that a conceptual
 
 understanding of it so like I can have an image of dog and then I can abstract from that the concept of this is what a dog is or dogness right and then then I can make a judgment about that which is again a function of the higher faculties but that means that the higher faculties are dependent on the lower faculties for their operations so if those don't work quite right that can start affecting the upper faculties but uh the the mental illness um in the book I talk about mental illness is basically if you this
 
 these higher this higher faculty of the intellect has the ability so if I make a judge about something and I keep making a judgment eventually I develop an intellectual habit which inclines me to judge those things that way and when that uh Habit is disordered or not in congruity with reality then I it blocks my ability to actually judge reality for what it is and that's essentially what true mental illness is at the higher faculties and that's distinct from what when the lower faculties because of one
 
 of two things which I'll talk about here in a minute when those aren't functioning quite right we can still on the higher faculties know I you know I'm depressed or there's something wrong or there's not I I'm not seeing this for what it is so there's a recognition on the higher faculties that okay I'm not fully I don't have full mental illness what I call mental illness per se it's not mental illness in the proper sense it's just a recognition like there's something not quite right with my laure
 
 faculties I got to get those straightened out so and that can be in one of two ways when we're wounded or we go through traumatic experiences it can cause those lower faculties to become um the the associations to be disordered or to be too strong in relationship to things Etc and so we can have traumatic events or certain things that can happen to us when we're younger and then that can result in the lower faculties not functioning properly and so then when it comes for later associations or when
 
 that when I think about images in the lower level that can result in my um those not being prepared properly so it can start affecting my higher functions but but sometimes people can make that they can experience that so that when those things don't function properly so for example you know like for example women who are traumatized by say their father or some man right then the lower faculties when they see another man by association it Associates this man masculinity or me men with the trauma
 
 and so they'll they'll have like this fear of men and so that's done at the lower levels and so and that I think you would probably agree that that kind of thing can happen it doesn't have to be like this horrible trauma like some kind of abuse or something it can just be something like your dad loses his temper and scares you or something like it can be something like that yeah it can actually be even from our formation so this is one of the things I talk about in one of my um in one of my videos
 
 where in our culture we're seeing this where they're habituating these lower faculties by constantly putting things together to basically tra form us to think according to certain patterns so like and I don't have a dog in this race really but when when all we heard for four years was orange man bad orange man bad orange Associated orange man with bad and that's what the lower faculty so even when you see the guy even if you know look the guy's not bad or whatever you think about him this thing comes up
 
 right and so this is what they they tend to do with people so it can be by formation just bad formation and obviously during what we sometimes call covid tied right the same thing was going on oh yeah yeah and what they were doing is they were associating fear with c certain things right yeah you know if you go out it's going to be you're going to kill somebody you know and so so they literally trying to make these associations which can dis deform us so it doesn't have to be trauma it can be a
 
 variety of different things that can uh disorder those lower faculties so there's and and that's that those are just that's a psychological issue I call that mental illness per aidans that is different from a psychiatric condition where um there are so for example people who have hypothyroidism which basically can result in a chemical disposition problem and as a result that people can actually experience uh um depressive symptomology even though they're strictly speaking not depressed which I saw in your questions we'll talk about
 
 later they don't really suffer from depression in the clinical sense this is just it's a chemical thing which can actually be the result of um just the indisposition as the result of the chemical indispositions um that are affecting the brain and so this is one of and so that's more of a psychiatric condition and one of the things that they began to realize is that uh certain things like that so if you if you correct that so people who have thyroid issues you can actually give them a proper medicine and that will corre
 
 correct that and all of a sudden their symptomology evaporates right so there are certain things that can actually um uh can be done in relationship to certain kinds of those um there are and this is something I should mention there are uh there is a there's been a series of studies that was done um I can't remember I just just saw it the other day um but there was um when they first began to realize that um the in the brain there was a set of receptors in relationship to dopamine and various other chemicals that those
 
 receptors um how much dopamine you had in relationship to the the number of receptors would determine very often our psychological on the lower level our psychological response in relationship to certain things our experience and relationship to certain things and so what they began to realize is that well we could increase dopamine uptake and then that would actually result in the person having more of a balance so this is when they when they started coming out more with psychotropic drugs and
 
 actually that's they they actually came out with psychic drug before they actually realized the mechanism that was kind of behind that uh later what they discovered so by the 1980s what they had discovered by the brain studies is that if you increase the dopamine levels what happens is is the brain begins to adjust by increasing the number of receptors in the brain in order to accommodate the up uh the dopamine uptake and this is based on the principle that the body adjusts itself right it just it that that's just
 
 a general principle and so what they realized is and this is why people would be on there's certain meds not all of them so there's certain meds that would put people on and then they would realize it had to keep increasing it and it eventually it just wasn't solving the problem and so uh and so this was one of the reasons why there's uh um um the uh I can't remember the name of it but it's um there's a couple of books out there called the chemical myth it doesn't mean that there's not chemical issues that
 
 can't necessarily affect people on the brain level it's just what they're saying is is that the the big Pharma knew that certain drugs not all of them but certain drugs didn't actually solve the chemical problem they actually exacerbated it but because it's a billion dollar industry they continue doing it so that's just some for people to kind of you can go online and and there's um there was a two-part series of video that was actually done by the guy that was investigative reporter had discovered this some kind brought it to
 
 light um but those are just something to come and keep in mind but there are certain there are some other forms of things in relationship to the brain where um once the person on a psychiatric level gets kind of straightened out then the symptomology stops yep so yeah you mentioned big Pharma in particular and I had a question about that in relation specifically to depression which we've mentioned a couple times so there seems to be some controversy as I've noticed over classifying it as an illness at
 
 least some people and I'll give an example from earlier this year I noticed on on Twitter conservative commentator Matt Walsh who I I generally appreciate his commentary and stuff too especially his documentary what is a woman the very important very important viewing there but he spent a few days this past January discussing depression on social media and during one of his podcasts and in response to someone on X I guess it's called X now I I always call it Twitter still yeah me too clarified his position
 
 and and this is what he said quote my argument is that depression is despair which ultimately is a product of The Human Condition and to one extent or another an inevitable experience for conscious beings in this world I think calling it a disease is a category air and also misses the point and in the end hinders our ability to deal with it effectively which is why he said depression rates are getting worse not better now to be Fair the broader context of all of this seemed to be his concern about big Pharma he says that
 
 quote the psychiatric industry has turned every negative emotion and behavior into a disease essentially in order to profit from the sale of psychiatric drugs so I was just curious to know what what are your thoughts about Walsh's position and how would you define depression would you qu classify it as a real illness um okay so it he's generally correct but there is it's it's uh okay so based on what we just got done discussing depression can actually have a three-fold cause the first can be psychiatric um which is by
 
 the way not that many percentages of the the cases that I've come across so um and in that particular case if uh you know the uh the psychiatric side of it like for example as I mentioned with hyp thyroidism if you have that issue you're going to feel feel the symptomology of depress depression technically speaking you're not clinically depressed because I'll get to that in a minute clinical depression is different from just kind of temporary or transitory depression so clinical depression is an ongoing thing
 
 this is uh it's I would argue it's a mental illness because it's a set of intellectual habits that have now taken over the individual and so they actually get a pleasure we actually know St Thomas mentions it um in his writings but you also see this actually they know this from Modern brain studies that people who are clinically depressed when they think about depressing thoughts they actually get a dopamine rush and so they actually they get pleasure out of thinking of this stuff right so there's
 
 a that's based on that's a that's clinical depression it's not transitory because it's a set of and mental habits it doesn't change immediately but it is something that can be changed um by um making choices about their thought patterns Etc and so they can actually climb out of this and actually overcome the mental habits the body does there's a general principle in Scholastic philosophy which says that the body adjusts itself to the operations of the Soul so one of the things that can actually happen is is
 
 that the body as I mentioned um it kind of adjusts itself so if I start thinking depressing thoughts it's going to adjust itself in order to um to uh engage in depressive thoughts right and so this is you're going to actually see a chemical shift in the brain in order to accommodate this thing um and actually a biological shift too there's going to be things are going to actually occur biologically in the brains are going to shift to accommodate this activity if it's if it's prolonged okay that means
 
 that someone like that so I I tend to subscribe to a school in Poland whose attitude is in cases like that what you may have to do is put people on a psychiatric drug to in order to uh stabilize them first on the psychiatric level but only for a short period of time because you don't want the brain to start uh developing all these receptors again and end up with a problem because when people come off the psychiatric drugs after the development of the re of the um excessive number of receptors there is there's a massive dopamine drop
 
 and then it they they really go through some difficult issues so the realize it really should be used as a stabilizing kind of a factor and then the person to stabilize the person and then get the person um doing the things that they need to do and then you can take them back off and then just through their own activity they can cause this brain the brain to readjust so there's those two that's different from a transitory kind of depression and in that case I would agree with Matt Walsh that it's
 
 basically people have a set of something there are bad things that are happening in their life legitimately bad and as a result of that they they go through kind of a Despair and and so this is not it's not clinical depression because a it's rooted in something real and B it's also it's uh it's also something which is transitory where they can actually climb out of it pretty quickly if they just you know okay I got to get my mind off of this I got to focus on other things if they with just a little little bit of
 
 help they don't those are the people that big Pharma are encouraging doctors who are not psychiatrists who don't have the expertise who aren't doing the proper um uh examinations and testing on the individual to make sure that this is actually an actual brain issue they're just immediately putting them on these drugs in order to just solve the pro the symptomology but the problem with that is that you're not addressing the root cause in the person's um uh either circumstances or surroundings or in
 
 their psychology that is ex causing the issue and so you're only masking the the um the thing by this basically you're deadening the brain in a large way in relationship to these things so if it's something that it's a clinical depression issue give them that for a little while to get them stabilized but then get them to where they can start uh take and then you wean them back off into it and the general idea by that is 3 to four weeks at the most six on the outside um but then out uh but then or
 
 if there is an actual chemical issue which can only really be determined um legitimately when they um by proper testing but if not then what they really need to do is just learn how to process the the the the bad things in their life that's what they need to do so in that sense and I think that's a majority of the people that are just go to say I feel depressed go to the doctor and then they put them on a drug you know which that's in the end that's not solving their problem right I would definitely
 
 agree with that uh one book I wanted to recommend that I found very helpful over the years and learning about this subject is by Dr Aaron kirati who is a a Catholic psychiatrist used to work at a a university in California I think it's called the Catholic guide to depression I don't know if father's ever read this one but I found it to be pretty helpful from Sophia Institute press so I just wanted to show that to folks um and yeah ultimately this discuss I really wanted to get into the the underlying causes of
 
 things like depression and anxiety is the subject of wounds which you discuss in your books um so it seems that you know psychological disorders many times as you say are the result of wounds which are as you describe them psychological injuries inflicted by another person or sometimes even upon ourselves through our sin and you discussed this at length in in both of your books introduction to the science of mental health and Dominion the nature of diabolic Warfare and you explained that a psychological wound is
 
 a complex uh in complex thing involving the cogitative power the possible intellect uh particularly in judgment and reasoning the will and the concupiscible appetite so maybe you can break down that that big terminology for us help us understand what is a psychological wound essentially so well a wound is obviously we're using that terminologically because it it has a similarity to some type a physical wound so a physical wound is when you like you take an knife or someone stabs you so that's the agency someone does something
 
 against us or we can stab ourselves you know um but then what it does is it causes damage to like to to our flesh or something like that and so in the same fashion when we get traumatized or something bad happens to us or even bad formation can actually over the long-term cause woundedness in the sense of you're messing The Faculty up what happens is is that um now there's damage caused to the faculty by damage I mean it renders The Faculty not capable of Performing its function the way it was designed by God to function because God
 
 actually designed our psychological faculties based off on the natural law to function in very specific ways and when they don't function that way then that we we would say that there's a wound somewhere in the person's um psychology and actually this is true about all of us um you know and sometimes you get even traditional Catholics will say what's all this woundedness you know this just sounds like a bunch of modern psychological mumbo jumbo but actually we say it every time at Mass you know um it's anomer Ana
 
 that our soul shall be healed you know exactly recognizing that and the church has always used that terminology woundedness in relationship to us um as human beings so there's always been that recognition so that means then once the once the wound happens it can't the the skin doesn't function properly it causes pain and then it also requires a healing process so this it's the same thing in relationship to psychology so uh the one of the primary faculties that get as I I mentioned it before is this power of the
 
 cogitative power is ability to make associations and so like as I mentioned like if a woman is traumatized by men now the cogitative power because of its experience um it now Associates uh you know trauma or bad things with men the person doesn't even have to be thinking about the particular man that hurt them when they're being around other men and having this reaction the conut power can just make that Association man this is bad so and that that's an indicator that the that no it's only this particular
 
 man or it's only specific man not all men and so that's why the cogitative power is now wounded in the sense that it's not functioning right so just as someone who's like their leg is wounded will walk in a limp fashion so will the psychological faculties not function quite right and so that's primarily that that it is primarily the woundedness in human beings begins in the cogitative power but then we can also be emotionally wounded which is um where in relationship to certain things we always
 
 experience like sorrow or pain or things of that sort and so um and also that like if something was re if if the woundedness that happened to us causes a great deal of Sorrow so for example like the the the woman with her father or something like that as human beings we have a natural inclination to want to love our father and to be you know under his care and when that is viol ated it causes a tremendous amount of sorrow and so we can actually become emotionally wounded as a result of that okay yes and
 
 again this is true about all of us in varying degrees there's so it can be from slight woundedness all the way up to pretty Gravely wounded because I've met um uh especially among women because they seem to be more vulnerable in this regard I've met women who you know their fathers were alcoholics or they were whatever and they would beat them and things like that and these women um at when they get older in life you know they're very strong women they might be very moral they might be leading trying
 
 to lead a good Catholic life but they're they're damaged in certain areas and so as a result their judgment because the cogitative power is the one that makes these associations and therefore affects our image and our imagination and so their judgment is off very often about things they tend to judge things excessively okay so then also woundedness can also be in the possible intellect so if I judge something falsely you know then and if and so for example if I judge yes men are bad all men are bad then what happens is now I'm
 
 left with this the intellectual wound and the possible intellect where now my future judgments about men are going to be affected so I'm going to when I'm around men I'm going to be watching for them I'm going to be say you know are they going to hurt me are they going to do this and I'll interpret this is something that you really see with people who are borderline personality disorder types every single thing you do it they they percept perceive ceive it as an injury as a Injustice I call them
 
 Injustice collectors right you just say you know good morning and they're just like what do you mean by that you know you're just so but anyway so but that is an indicator that their judgment has now been affected and so they can it's almost like a wound that's festering and that's puss and it's you know just the slightest touch is like screaming pain kind of thing right yeah yeah exactly in fact we'll get we can talk a little bit about this in relationship to Healing what we have to precisely along that
 
 line that you just mentioned so the wound those are the those are the faculties um uh and then also in the will so but the the concubus appetite can be um you can suffer the um that's just the that's just the part of us that has the ability to have the emotions that pertain to delightful things pleasurable things but then also um negative things like sorrow and things like that um the erasable appetite is the one that has the ability to engage in things that are um uh uh that are arduous and difficult you know and that
 
 it's called the rasal because it deals with anger so people who are really angry a lot of times it's because they've been wounded and so their um St Thomas defines anger as a perception of injury with a desire for in Vindication well when we're wounded that means for example physical wound if I've been physically wounded it means that the skin around that wound is super sensitive or the wound is sensitive well the same thing and psychologically when people are wounded they're also very psycholog olc Al sensitive to what
 
 people say and so they tend to become more angry or overreact Etc so um and so that's why a lot of times angry angry people they really have to learn how to process their own woundedness in order to get over that so those are kind of the general areas in which we can become uh wounded and there's different ways of addressing each one of those right so a book I've have uh read some of recently just trying to learn more about this subject in preparation for our interview partly um in his book called be healed
 
 Catholic psychologist Bob shes he's the founder of something called The jp2 Healing Center I think it's down in Florida right um he calls in his book he calls them the seven deadly wounds kind of a play on words for the seven deadly sins he identifies them as abandonment fear powerlessness hopelessness confusion rejection and shame and he says when we are wounded we often internalize messages about ourselves this in turn deeply affects our identity the way we see ourselves we may believe with our intellects that God are that we
 
 are God's beloved children but our hearts believe a different message so what do you think about his classification system you and would you agree that these wounds often lead us to believe lies or maybe exaggerations about ourselves and our circumstances I think you kind of already answered that a little bit but yeah absolutely yeah in fact the W in fact yes I mean I would give it a kind of a turistic um kind of analysis to it which is basically means that when when we get wounded or hurt that what happens to us we now
 
 psychologically associate with us that is bad things happen to me and so human beings by Nature well when bad things happen to you they start thinking well then I must be bad that these things bad things have happened to me or that I'm in this pain or or what have you and so it can develop into those things uh uh precisely as um uh Dr shes talks about and I think that I I I mean I there's I think a lot of these classifications like his are very helpful um I I think that sometimes they're somewhat Limited
 
 in in their use and scope I think he's trying to break it down into layman's terms so to speak you lose some of the you lose some of the substance probably yeah which is which has its place right I mean it does have its place and it can be very helpful for people to begin to understand that this is what my patterns are thinking of because of this right which I think is helpful in relationship to that and you're seeing a lot of that work that's being done um that's actually improved significantly in the
 
 last 15 to 20 years there's been a lot of work that's being done by people you also see this even in relationship to Father wounds right that is uh one of the things that has to do with um you'll see more and more in relationship to um um SSA issues and things like that which people like Paul vits and those have talked about that and the uh Etc but anyway that all being said um the these things can actually be very help ful because they can actually about half about depending on the type of uh psychological illness or the difficulty
 
 that the person psychologically is dealing with about half to 80% is just understanding the structure of what they're dealing with right and then the other 20 to 50% is okay now I know what I need to put in place to overcome it right and so U knowing it is you know is is a large part of it yeah I remember you you mentioned in um in Dominion somewhere talking about you need to know the specific faculty that's been affected or is being affected by the wound in order to Target that area and and do specific things to get over that
 
 um and something I noticed uh that Dr shoes he disting and this is not unique to him of course but he distinguishes in his book between the intellect and the heart and we know what the intellect is but sometimes the heart is a word we tend to use a lot but aren't necessarily able to Define as easily now the catechism of the Catholic Church does describe the heart as the of one's being where the person decides for or against God as well as the seat of moral personality I was just curious do you know if ainus has ever discussed the
 
 heart what does that mean or how would you define it yeah well actually ainus doesn't talk too much about it other than the context of the will so actually if you look at the history if you actually look at the history of the use of that term heart in the spiritual literature it means primarily the will which is what the catechism the Catholic church is talking it's the will primarily okay but it it sometimes is extended to also include the the uh emotions or the appetites under the direction of the will so they'll they'll
 
 include those so um but usually when they see they mean heart um that's what usually what they mean primarily the will but it can also include both and I think that one of the things that though that Dr sh is really pointing out which is really key is is that and you see this even with people like when they forgive people who have hurt them or even when they're um intellectually as he mentioned they understand okay this is what I'm actually dealing with I would argue that okay what you're seeing
 
 there is that the possible intellect which is this immaterial part of the intellect has the ability to see the truth about the matter but the lower faculties are still this cogitative power that Association especially if I've confirmed it by thinking about it and saying yes this is true I confirm that thing and it's and I actually can habituate the ctive power and how I make these associations and so or if something is really traumatic has happened to me that leaves a longlasting impression in the cuta of power so that
 
 even if intellectually I know okay this is what the case is that doesn't mean that the that the cogitative power and then the emotions consequent to that aren't still going to have those experiences or make those associations it just means so for example I can forgive somebody in uh in my will because intellectually I know okay this is what I need to do and I will to forgive them that doesn't mean that I'm not going to have the emotional response that is still part of that when I'm around the individual initially it takes
 
 a long time to heal those wounds by looking at them and from a specific point of view and retraining the cogitative power to change how it Associates and that's part of the healing process and that takes time and so people I'm sure a lot of Grace as well asking for the grace of healing I know you talk about that as well yes exactly so people have to be patient with themselves and realize that there's it's very very rare that a person 's mental illness issues are corrected by a single thing although sometimes you do
 
 see that once in a while but it's pretty extraordinary usually even though once they realize okay this is what the issue is you know even though they recognize yes I'm a Child of God yes I should have charity for myself that I am lovable that there are these attributes they're still going to have these associations based upon their woundedness and how how people hurt them so much they're still going to have those and that takes time to train the cuta of power to look at it differently to store memories which
 
 these C the cogitative powers relying on those have to also be changed and those are changed by what we think about and things like that and so those have to be changed so that and so there's a lot it's a healing process and this is one of the reasons why um working with healing of memories and things like that very often has a tremendous impact yes so yeah and I we can get a little bit into the healing of wounds which is ultimately what we all want right I mean that was a a major part of our Lord's
 
 Earthly Ministry obviously was healing not only of bodies but also of souls that's right so you observe in um in your books that only those with the proper psychological tools and resilience can heal and you discuss several such tools or or remedies as you also call them in your books for example you just mentioned purification of memory uh counseling provided that it's done by someone who's not going to lead you in a weird uh crazy Direction which I want to ask about how do you find a decent a good counsel also but you also
 
 mentioned the importance of forgiveness prayer especially meditation or mental prayer um devotion especially to the Sacred Heart things like Detachment mortification and the development of virtue and of course also the power of confession for healing those wounds which we inflict on ourselves through sin uh we don't have time to cover all of these of course but maybe we could focus on just a few for example I was hoping you could tell us a little about um the aordance of developing virtue both on a natural level and then of

D253	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9UVBEZN69k	this is our snow room it is one of my favorite how much weight did you lose 25 kilos the Allure is lifechanging weight loss one word game changer this is transformational medicine but does it come with life ending risk he was only on it for 19 days I can't accept that someone can just stop living on 60 Minutes the breakr to treat Parkinson's drug addiction early onset ALS ERS the drugs reshaping the world are these drugs safe we don't leave matches in the hands of children has to be supervised so how far would you go  why are we risking Our Lives to be thin is a recall something you're considering blame it on our success as a wealthy Western Nation but we live with an enormous problem our size too many Australians are too big everyone knows excess weight is is bad for our health but battling the Bulge is a fight too few of us win and that's the reason drugs like OIC are so in demand they promise a quick fix to losing kilos even though they're not designed as weight loss remedies but users beware the OIC hype is starting to wither replaced with  the reality that it and similar drugs are very risky even deadly for much of her life growing up debilitating pain was Shannon Natalia's unwelcome but constant companion it was an Agony made worse by not knowing what caused it or how to fix it it feels like you are in a wet suit and fill the inside of the wet suit with like just sludge and heavy heavy sand and then you're having to walk around found in that wet suit and it's just strapped to your legs after years of scratching their heads in 2020 doctors finally diagnosed  Shannon with lipedema an incurable disease that had produced an abnormal buildup of fat in her lower body at first pain management was limited there's everything here that you could even think of to be honest the gym and cold therapy recovery sessions provided minor relief so this is our snow room it is one of my favorite components to use for pain management okay so this is the Himalayan rock salt room but then Shannon's GP prescribed injections of OIC I felt normal all of a sudden my inflammation was gone my pain  was gone all because of OIC nothing had made the impact that that made OIC had originally been developed to treat diabetes but when it became known a side effect of the drug was rapid weight loss its popularity exploded I wanted to show you guys that everyone starts somewhere even if you're starting back somewhere Shannon is proof it's effective her transformation was amazing and not only did her pain disappear so did the excess kilos lipedema had cruy inflicted how much weight did you lose 25 kilos lipedema is now one of many  conditions scientists believe could be treated successfully with medications like OIC and with a mass of enthusiastic spooking from social and mainstream media it's no surprise these products have taken on the label of Wonder drugs drugs like OIC may also help curb drug addiction o zic could help people with early onset Alzheimer's if you could use it for all these applications it would truly be a miracle drug I liken this to when the te Ford was first um invented and suddenly we had changes in  transportation and the horse and cart went out professor of medicine and endocrinologist at St Vincent's Hospital Dr Katherine zaris is Blown Away by the potential of drugs like OIC have you ever seen a drug explode around the world the way o empad not really when I think back at other points in medical history probably the introduction of penicillin has been as transformative so this is it's a game Cher incredible yes but by no means a miracle in the making while OIC and a number of similar weight loss injections  come with promise they also bring risk a g drug Roy Webster is convinced about the cause of his wife's death 12 months ago Trish Webster had been taking an OIC like medication called sax sender to lose a few kilos because she wanted to look her best at her daughter's wedding she shouldn't be gone you know I don't think she should be gone she didn't deserve that Trish was thought to be the first Australian Death linked to these weight loss injections but after 60 Minutes reported it late last year more families  contacted us with similar stories how did he feel about his weight he used to joke that you know you needed a big carcass to carry around a big heart but he wanted to be healthy he wanted to live a long life and now I can carry his ashes around in one hand Sue and Elise Ramsey want answers they want to know why 18 months ago their much-loved husband and Dad Tim died after taking injections of sax sender what made him decide he wanted to lose weight I think it was um the prospect of um maybe walking at least  down the aisle that he thought I do need to lose weight Tim was a trucky it was a job that made exercise and eating well difficult so when the 58-year-old decided to try sax sender to lose weight Sue thought it was worth a try so Tim went to the GP and asked for it y she gave him the script and said it will be good for all aspects of your life it it will protect protect all your organs and so that's when he thought yep that sounds good to me Tim was confident the injections would work but after only 19 days  something was clearly wrong here the truck would you be a to come down and take hospital please thank you when Elise received this voicemail you can hear the desperation in his voice it doesn't sound like him that's not his voice she rushed him to hospital Tim was complaining of severe stomach pain but after a series of tests the doctors couldn't find anything a Miss did you mention to the doctors that he was taking sxender yes and I asked if that would was um bit problematic for his other medication and he said no that  would be fine so really there was nothing more they said about the sex sender they just sent him home the following night Tim's pain got worse he collapsed in the bathroom at home 40 minutes of CPR couldn't save him last November 14 months after he died a coroner ruled Tim's cause of death was undetermined but Sue says that doesn't make sense I don't believe that anybody should die without an explanation there has got to be you just don't expire there has got to be a reason for Tim's death and so I think that's when we  really really thought maybe the sex Ender had a lot to do with it [Music] yeah you just do not expect to find your daughter on her knees in front of the toilet ball dead Leoni margets knows the distress Sue and Elise Ramsey feel her 39-year-old daughter Naomi Rooney died in June 2022 after taking OIC injections Naomi was desperate to be a mom and had been told she needed to lose weight to have any chance of falling pregnant she was very aware of turning 40 and her options of being a m were they were running  out as an experienced nurse Naomi had an expert knowledge of drugs and their side effects but even so something tragic happened after she started using the zic my first thought through my head was this cannot be happening this cannot be happening this cannot be real but things just happen so quickly and then it was an awful awful tussle to wrestle her out of the out of the toilet and to get her onto the floor to try and do CPR yeah and she never regained Consciousness no now when a partner um picked her up he said straight away that  she was blue around her mouth and there's nothing that I can do to erase that image Leon is angry at the ease in which her daughter Gotto zenic she bought it online after filling out a simple questionnaire and having a telephone consultation with a Doctor Naomi Rooney and Tim Ramsay's deaths are now both being investigated by Australia's drug regulator the therapeutic Goods Administration but their families want more they're demanding the TGA make doctors do more to ensure their patients use drugs like OIC safely why can't you  give them more than guidance why can't you tell them don't do it Ashley Keenan was the perfect patient to be prescribed OIC the Canadian has diabetes and is overweight but the drug that was supposed to save her life almost killed her I was only on OIC for about 4 months when I ended up in the ICU an intensive care unit for 10 days I nearly died Ashley suffered what's now emerging as a serious concern a severe gastrointestinal reaction to the drug the doctors told me it was what they call a perfect storm the side effects of  the OIC gave me pancreatitis the pancreatitis caused me to vomit uncontrollably I actually remember one of the ER doctors telling me that he roped in every specialist that he could so so that he could try to save my life despite her near-death experience OIC had been doing what it's become famous for Ashley was losing the kilos but when she stopped taking the drug and returned home from hospital she quickly put weight back on what she did next was confounding I'm quite ashamed of this at one point I actually went back on OIC  because I hated how much weight I had re gained and my doctors gave it to me they they said okay well we're going to monitor you more closely this time and after two months I had pancreatitis again it made me realize like okay this medication is harmful doesn't that show the power of this drug though even though you nearly died you went back for more I know it's it's not something I'm proud of um but it did really open my eyes to how I I thought about myself and my body Ashley's experience is what Dr  Mahia etan has been researching at the University of British Columbia he's been studying the increased prevalence of gastrointestinal issues in people taking AIC and similar drugs for weight loss what he found worries him we looked at the risk of for um gastrointestinal type conditions and I can say on average there was an added increase in risk of around 5% in absolute terms why were these findings concerning to you Doctor because although the 05% uh on the surface may not seem like a large number when we consider that  millions of people around the world are taking these drugs it could translate into a relatively uh large number of people affected in fact Dr etan calculates the current OIC craze means several hundred, people could be suffering potentially deadly side effects but back in Australia Professor Katherine zarus says the risks can be mitigated with proper medical care doctor are these drugs safe used appropriately cautiously Guided by experts these drugs are very safe currently OIC is only approved by the T  GA to treat diabetes it's no secret that drugs like OIC are landing in the hands of people who shouldn't be on it why do we need to be cautious we need to be cautious because these drugs have adverse effects and these adverse effects can be really very severe but this can be prevented but you have to be advised how to do that and a handout and an internet consultation is not enough one needs to see an expert these can be dangerous drugs if they're left in the hands of people we don't leave matches  in the hands of children we shouldn't leave these drugs in the hand hands of people it has to be [Music] supervised and the benefit of these drugs I don't think should be overlooked but they're not the Silver Bullet for weight loss Professor Robin langum is the chief medical advisor at the therapeutic Goods Administration one of her roles is to investigate adverse outcomes associated with pharmaceutical drug use she's well aware of the tragic cases of Trish Webster Tim Ramsey and Naomi Rooney but is guarded about whether  their deaths could impact the use of OIC like drugs in Australia clearly anytime anybody loses a loved one in association with a drug that they've been prescribed or a device that have they've been using is just absolutely devastating and you know we really feel a responsibility every death that's reported to us is investigated and if we do see that there's a need to change the messaging with the drug the information that goes with the drug or even in some cases to withdraw the drug then we have the power  to do so is a recall something you're considering a recall is a very serious decision that we'd make and only done when the risks are completely outweighing the benefits of these drugs determining that will take time but more immediately Professor langum warns of another danger at present GPS should only prescribe OIC for the treatment of diabetes not weight loss but the reality is many doctors are simply ignoring the guidelines our guidance to doctors is that they focus the use of the limited amount of asmic that's in the country  that they focus the use of that OIC on patients that have type 2 diabetes why can't you give them more than guidance why can't you tell them don't do it our work is is uh guided very much by the legislation that we have and we don't have the powers to uh mandate it's less than one 1% of people who have these adverse effects but that's still somebody's dad it's still somebody's sister it's still somebody's loved one absolutely absolutely it's a very serious and and uh and very tragic problem for the families that are  concerned and uh we don't wish to minimize that at all but there's yet another frustration faced by the TGA the success of OIC for weight loss has caused a worldwide shortage of the product and that's led to a growing practice by pharmacists to make their own versions of the drug for patients that are receiving compounded semaglutide type products this is not a zic this is not the drug that has been uh extensively evaluated and tested and approved uh for its safety and uh its efficacy it's a dilemma what to do about  the use of OIC and drugs like it for weight loss Shannon Natalia is convinced they work the families of Tim Ramsey and Naomi Rooney say otherwise for many of us the desire to be thinner is over helming but at what cost what's your warning to people who would be watching this and they know they shouldn't be on it I don't think people who want to fit into a frock for their school reunion uh or look good on their social media should be using this I think that that's a complete waste of time and dangerous and preventing people  who need the drug from accessing it hello I'm Emelia Adams thanks for watching 60 minutes Australia subscribe to our

J280	https://youtu.be/3iWhhRxyRJk?si=pUjo75XKZeM21JBA	i'm going to show you three ways to make your water drinkable but before we do we need to go over all the little things you need to be sure of before you even think about treating your rain water to make it drinkable the first thing we want to do is start at the roof the material your roof is made out of determines whether or not your rain water will be able to be drinkable or not the best roofing that you can have is a galvanized steel roofing it's common all throughout here in hawaii other roofing materials such as terra  cotta or asphalt roof just leach way too much debris and chemicals into the water making it almost impossible to filter for drinking so you want to be sure that you have a roof that collects clean rain water before it even gets into the tank next you want to be sure that you keep your gutters clean gutters are a common spot for debris for pathogens for all sorts of things to accumulate and to get into your water supply so i like to make sure that i check on my gutters at least two times per year maybe more if  you know that you get more debris in your gutters but be sure to keep those gutters clean and by doing that you'll also keep out mosquitoes you want to be sure to limit as much debris from getting into this water tank here as possible so by installing leaf guards on the downspouts or other pre-filters on my system here i have a pantyhose covering the inlet pipe going into my tank and it collects all of the debris before it gets a chance to falling in and every once a month or so i just change out the  pantyhose with a fresh clean pantyhose and i am able to create a clean water inside my tank just by doing that but occasionally your tank does get dirty and you want to make sure that you keep your tank clean i made a video that shows you exactly how to clean your catchment tank how to clean it how to treat it and how to make sure that it's the cleanest possible water sitting there in your tank it's not drinkable yet but it's about to be now before i show you how to turn that water that's clean nice and  clean sitting here into the tank into drinking water why don't you go ahead and plant your finger on that like button every time you plant your finger you're helping this channel grow and speaking of growing if you want to help this channel grow even more why don't you head over to homesteading.com amazon and you could do all your shopping on amazon from there all right we're going to start with the most popular way to filter your rain water into drinking water and that is with a uv water filter that we have right here  this uv water filter system is really common around here in east hawaii it's been approved to turn rain water catchment water into drinking water for the whole house so this water coming out of your your tap your shower your kitchen sink all that water is made drinkable with this system what it does is it has a uv bulb that neutralizes the bacterias and pathogens that normally make you sick when you drink water that's untreated it kills those off and it allows you to be able to drink the water safely of course you have to  have a couple pre-filters in there to get some of the larger debris and sediment out before it gets down to the uv filter that actually kills those microscopic bacterias and pathogens that these filters can't take care of one of the drawbacks of this system is that you got to change the bulb every year once in a while you got to change this ballast right here the bulb itself costs a little over a hundred dollars and sometimes you don't know if it's necessarily working or not it can get dirty inside  the light can get blocked and your water may not be getting filtered that's something to be um concerned of so i advise checking your bulb at least twice a year to make sure that everything is clean inside and working properly it's a pretty good system to have but for those of you who are limited on power you're really off grid you only have a couple solar panels this may not be the best system for you it takes a good amount of power to run this thing so i want to show you this next way to filter water a way that  doesn't take any power except for the power of the pump to move the water through your house let's go check it out another way to filter your rain water to make the water in your home drinkable is with this clarify quantum disinfection filter right here this thing is great for off grid home setters it takes no power it doesn't require you to set up any plugs or any additional things all you got to do is have some basic plumbing skills and you can get this thing hooked up once again i like to make sure that i  have a series of pre-filters uh going from 30 microns down to 15 down to five maybe even down to even lower two or whatnot make sure that you have some pre-filters before the water gets to this system here and then this system uses a sort of quantum technology it neutralizes the ions of pathogens and diseases that might be found in water and it kills it utilizing no power to do it so it's a great system to have if power tends to go out where you live you don't have to worry about is your water drinkable or not  because this thing works whether you have power or not one of the drawbacks though is the price of exchanging out the filters this unit nowadays i hear costs about 600 and replacing the filter can cost about 300 prices have gone up since i originally got this unit here a few years back it makes having drinking water off-grid a really simple easy thing something you don't have to worry about so uv filters and quantum disinfection are a great way to filter your whole house for water but that depends on having an operable  pump uh electricity but what happens if you don't have those things and you still need drinking water i like to have redundancy in my life and there are a few backups out there that we can use that can filter our rain water without any power or pumps or anything whatsoever one way is a berkey water filter they are a gravity fed water filtration system that fits on the counter in your kitchen and you just pour water in the top it filters down and at the bottom you have clean drinking water it doesn't make all  the water in your house drinkable but you do have drinking water available now i don't use a berkey because i already have a whole house water filter but i do have backup the backup for my home is this lifestraw whole house water filter if you've ever gone backpacking or whatnot lifestraw has a product known as a sort of lifestraw pen or straw if you will where you can pretty much just stick it in water and and suck right through that thing and be able to drink water straight out of there but this is just a  larger version of that this one can filter water by simply filling it up and allowing the water to filter through and you have enough water to feed to provide for a few people i could just use the water straight out of this water tank to be able to filter through this thing right here it doesn't require me to have any pumps or anything so in case all else fails i have my backup water filter right here so there you have it everyone three ways to make your rain water drinkable you never have to worry about drinking water  again take care of your water and it will take care of you make sure that you keep your rain water tanks clean and if you don't know how i made a video that you can check out here and every once in a while test that water to make sure that it doesn't have any pathogens or whatnot that you may have missed and i made a video showing you how to test your water right here that you can check out so once again everybody thanks for watching i appreciate you make sure you subscribe so you never miss another one until next  time ahui ho 
S280	https://youtu.be/u6bT7dxmxMU?si=05jklkyHYG7kEfSL	is our drinking water safe let's look into it [Music] hello everyone and welcome back to my channel uh today i'm going to take a look at our drinking water uh the reason this came up a couple weeks ago i saw a youtube video uh an expat couple not too far from here actually they were saying in their video that our drinking water that most people get here uh in the blue jug everyone refers to it is the blue jug it's from the water station uh every burn guy around here has one or two stations so there's a lot of them  they were saying in there that the water from there is no good and that the people don't take care of the equipment they don't change the filters because they cost too much and i was i was a little taken back by it because i'd never heard this before i've been here quite a few years i've never heard of never heard anybody speak about the only thing people talk about is you know make sure you get your water from like the blue jug from the water station don't drink the tap water everyone knows that here  and so i was all taken back by it so i said in a live stream uh on pilot's channel that uh you know i didn't really believe them uh i even had people uh message me uh a couple people and they were like two days later and they were saying that all the people rip every rip off the poor filipinos with the you know from the water it's no good and all this stuff and it was like you know again taken back i said this guy must have watched the same video i did because you never hear about that you never hear anything like that about it  and uh so my take on it was you would hear something okay i mean there's so much of it going on that you would hear from somebody about it okay and afterwards though i thought you know what a hypocrite maybe maybe there's some truth to it so i decided to find out you can get these little testers this little little one a couple hundred pesos i think about 230 delivered uh you can get up you know a thousand pesos 1200 pesos you know that they're not that expensive but you know they seem to be pretty accurate uh  at least good enough to kind of get a rough idea what are we looking at here so let's get into it let's go see what we got all right this won't take too long follow along all right well here we go we got the blue jug okay and uh this you know kind of give us a good baseline i've got some uh hopefully that'll focus in there a little bit that is distilled drinking water now that should be pretty good okay distilled because of the process so i got that and now i got blue the dreaded tap water and we'll  you know compare between these and let's see where we end up okay all right so i've got the distilled water i don't know if i can focus in on that too well it's really a small little meter but it says zero hmm i wonder if this thing's even working but then again distilled water should be the very cleanest there is okay all right so now we've got the dreaded tap water so i don't still i don't know if you can read it but we're definitely getting a reading okay 577. okay all right so here is the blue jug  from the water station and it's reading 13. okay so there we got the readings now what do they mean okay this meter is in parts per million other meters have uh just a numerical number and then you got to look at the scale to compare it to what what that is in parts per million but this one is just direct parts per million so it's very easy to figure out it's got a little scale on the back again kind of small even a little hard for me to read but nothing surprised has been here okay so distilled water was zero  and it should be really if you think about it so that's the actual absolute purest you're going to get distilled water okay so according to this 0 to 20 is very high quality drinking water okay purified drinking water and the blue jug was 13. okay so looks pretty good the tap water was over 500 577 according to this that is considered polluted water by bpa us epa standards well that may be a little bit more than i wanted to hear but actually i did look into that before and remember this is uh standards for  drinking water okay which are very high standards potable water for using like washing clothes taking a shower in comes under different standards and 577 it's not very good but it's not going to kill you i think some of us may remember something happened in flint michigan in the usa not too long ago and i understand the water there was part of the parts per million was in the thousands okay several thousand parts per million okay now now this tester is just for testing of total dissolved solids okay  but now that can include minerals which mineral water is not that bad for as long as certain levels you know kind of low levels actually you can also have biologics in there okay um you know uh bacteria uh also it could become chemical but the thing is with parts per million when it's the number is very low it doesn't matter if it's all mineral or all biological it's so low that it's considered safe for you okay so that's what you look at if you need to know what it actually is you have to go to a lab or have a very  sophisticated tester not something that we can just buy aquazoda okay but it's really a good handy tool to see you know what's going on at your place you know [Music] maybe you have your own filter system a real good way to keep track of it make sure it's working right okay so i'm not really surprised by all of this like i said i think i would have heard something about this being a problem the video was that i saw uh that the expat couple on there you know they were pretty much just blowing it off sounded like they were just  repeating the same old hateful stuff you hear on the forums and the facebook groups here you got a lot of group of people that just everything about philippines is bad everything everything all all the girls are bad you know it's just so generalization okay uh do some of them have bad water i'm sure they do there's a lot of them here like i said probably two in every barangay at least two in every baron guy i'm sure your bigger barangay is gonna have a lot more than that so yeah of course they do  but i think the majority of them are probably pretty good and uh you know in that video they were saying they don't want to spend the money and change the filters every month because they're expensive well they really don't know the process and the way these uh stations work and the way the operation is in there um one first thing is you don't change the filters every month okay it's over a certain period of time you have one or two of the filters that are very expensive the rest of them are not that terribly expensive they're also  back flushed on a regular basis to clean them out the way that the main filter on one of these works the first pass filter is a very expensive one my cats are playing hard rough necking and that's what that noise is so they have a first pass and it's a very expensive about a hundred dollars for filters it's not really that bad but it is an industrial type filter and it can be used for a pretty good amount of time as long as it's properly back flushed and what will happen is if you don't it's going to clog up mostly  with minerals and if it clogs up you're just not going to get no water flow you're not going to have bad water coming out of it you're just not not going to have any water at all and then you can't do your business because you can't feel the jokes okay so they are replaced on a certain time frame but not every month so obviously in that video they don't they don't know what they're talking about they don't know the way the uh you know the water stations work the way the systems work and so anyway  so like i said it's it it's a lot of stuff that you hear repeated around here from people just you know seem to have a negative effect on everything about the philippines i said you know you got to be careful what you listen to um but like i said i was afterwards i i thought well you know they could be right but now i know that my water is pretty good and that's why i thought i would let you guys know uh this is a good item to have something you might want to use and keep around it could be pretty handy at  least you'll be able to know you won't be guessing you won't be speculating well don't ah all right hold up which one was that was that the oh no honey 
G281	https://youtu.be/m5S042RAc4k?si=ZeCwN8-kIGWvc-VJ	if you don't use it will you lose it I'm talking about sexual intercourse and your vagina so many of you guys have asked me you said Dr Jen I don't have sex often I haven't had sex for a long time etc etc whatever the situation might be if I don't use my vagina in this way for a long time could I lose it you ask and that's a really great question I'm going to answer that question today I'm going to tell you what can happen um if you don't use your vagina for a while in terms of sexually with sex ual intercourse guys I'm Dr Jen  coddle practicing family physician on air health expert and Video Creator I want to start by busting a couple of myths that you guys um have asked me about that I've seen on the goog smugler number one is I'm seeing a and I'm sort of giving you the answer right but I'm seeing people online saying things like your Heyman will regrow or grow back if you don't have sexual intercourse for a while so let me first of all debunk that one because that is not true okay once the Hyman is altered from sexual  intercourse or whatever because other things that can alter the Heyman um no it doesn't regrow regrow or grow back or things like that so no that's not the case even if you don't have sex for a long time your Hyman uh is not does not regrow okay the other thing that I've seen online that you guys might be wondering about is people have asked hey if I don't have sex for a long time uh is it true that my vagina will close up and maybe that's what people mean when they say if you don't use it will you  lose it well good news here guys is nope it's not going to close up okay okay um uh there are situations where a vagina can close up but this is not necessarily one that I think of so it's not going to close because you're not having sex all right um so I hope that that's helpful but let me tell you what can and may happen if you don't have sex for a while and by the way I should say um it's perfectly fine to do whatever is right for you this video is not a video advocating for sex now there are tons of  benefits of sex from intimacy to stress reduction I'm going to some of these later to perhaps improve sleep um so many other things right mental health reasons whatever but this is the thing you know look everybody has a different preference a different style a different um even libido so what you choose for you is your choice and whatever you choose is okay all right um but let me go back so we're now we're g to now we're going to jump into the me of this video uh which is about what happens to  your vagina if you don't have sex for a long time this I decided to do this video because a lot of you guys wrote in comments of my other videos you guys remember the video on what happens to your vagina as you age I also have the video on vaginal dryness the video about vaginal dryness came up from a lot of the comments you put on uh the video what happens to your vagina as you age and on the vaginal dryness one a lot of you guys said hey if I don't use my vagina will I lose it so first of all  thank you all for all your comments take a look at those videos if you have not by the way just DM me if you can't find the links I'll put them in the description but uh first thing let's just jump right in now okay first thing that can happen if you do not have sexual intercourse for a while is that your uh vagina can experience decreased elasticity so what is elasticity you know you think about something as almost being able to snap back being able to stretch being malleable right um and if you're not sexually active um for a  while you could experience decreased elasticity meaning it's not as malleable pliable it's not as stretchy it doesn't it doesn't um it doesn't give the way it would or perhaps does when you're more sexual active Okay now one thing I should say and um I didn't realize this until I was going back and and editing the video um but sometimes this decreased elasticity can cause either discomfort pain Etc with sexual intercourse may not cause anything you may not notice anything but some people may find that it feels a little  different uh or may feel a little bit uncomfortable maybe at first or maybe for a little while first of all I should say that pain discomfort with intercourse always need to be evaluated by your doctor you should really get that checked out but just understand that that elasticity could do that how much decreased elasticity occurs really depends on the woman also probably depends on whether you are premenopausal or postmenopausal as well because things like vaginal dryness and thinning of the vaginal walls which can happen in post  uh and postmenopausal women uh can contribute to that elasticity um and and younger women or women who are premenopausal may not experience it to the same degree but decreased elasticity definitely can happen um you certainly can bounce back with sexual activity but how long it takes to bounce back how much you bounce back uh probably depends on your age uh and so many other factors but yes that is one thing that can happen uh your vagina becomes less elastic if you are not using it uh with sexual intercourse okay uh the other  thing that can happen Okay is um some people say that actually and I say some people some experts say that if you don't have sex for a long time your libido will actually go down that is your desire for sex okay now some women experience this some women experience a increased interest in sex they haven't had sex for a long time and the interest for it really just kind of Fades okay I have plenty of patients who've said this I also have patients though on the other side who feel that their libido has gone  up the lack of sex has actually or whether it's that or other factors but with the lack of sex um they feel more sort of interested in sex okay so I think one of either of those can happen your libido may not change at all but you could also experience a decreased interest in sex or desire for sex but you could also have an increased uh libido or desire for sex as well I think that's a thing um and then let's go to some of the other things that can happen when you don't have sex for a while this  is not necessarily affecting um uh the vagina per se but your whole body remember that sexual activity intimacy is important for our well-being um not just sexual intercourse right but intimacy and connection with other people your partner or having a partner that does a lot for our soul um you know not just our body but our soul as well also sex can also relieve stress being an anxiety reducer may help with sleep may do so many other things but let's also talk about Stress and Anxiety um around the active sex many of you  actually have written in on the comments saying you haven't had sex for a long time and the thought of being sexually active after having not been sexually active for a long time actually makes you nervous makes you anxious um and so specifically you know I think and I've seen this with patients and you guys have told me this too not having sex for a long time I think could cause some anxiety in some of us when say jumping back in the saddle okay simply because hey you haven't done it in a while now  is that a natural feeling or natural emotion if you feel that way absolutely right anytime we kind of do something new or do something we haven't done in a long time it'd be like if I didn't drive for a long time and then got back in you know behind the wheel I'd be a little nervous right um so if that's how you feel that's okay and that seems plenty natural okay but yeah not having sex for a while and then you decide to you could feel nervous about that right um another thing that can happen um after not having sex for a while is  it could take more for you to get aroused you may not be able to get aroused at the same speed and sort of tempo Etc that you could before okay not everybody will experience this but plenty of people do experience after long periods of absence where their time to arousal is longer and maybe what uh they require to become aroused takes is different right might take more or take less it's just a different thing so don't be surprised if arousal um in the state of getting aroused uh changes as um as you go longer and longer without  uh with with absence okay um also other people talk about and I guess this sort of goes with a decreased elasticity there can be a tightness to the vagina but again I think that's just another way of describing decreased elasticity decreased stretchiness and stuff that I mentioned in the beginning about things that can happen when you simply have had passional intercourse um for a while okay these are just a few things that can happen uh as you go for a long period of time without having sex once  again it's perfectly fine to go for a while without having sex uh if that's your choice okay uh you're not going to lose your vagina it's not going to cease working um it's not going to close up you will not regrow a Hyman it's and I I don't want and also as many of you guys have written and asked about this um there also seems and I maybe I'm just sort of rejecting but I've sensed almost like a sense of Shame and I have to say some many of the men who've written on uh comments on my videos have been very  supportive but um some people whether men or women have been negative about the concept of not having sex for a long time on the on the part of the woman I want to make sure that there is no shame surrounding this do not be shamed or feel shamed if this is you it is okay to be absent it is okay to go long periods without having sex uh it's okay to never go any periods without having sex if you are someone who has sex every day twice a day that is okay too but what I don't want is I don't want to see shame and I  don't want you to feel shamed okay it's okay it is um and what I would say is uh there are certain medical conditions and things that can cause uh problems with your vagina cause the opening to the vagina to feel more stenos or close up for medical reasons if you have any concerns and you're saying gosh something doesn't seem right see your obgy and your doctor right away okay this video is just for a little bit of food for thought your doctor really should be the one guiding you through everything and making sure that  everything down there is normal especially if you have a question but guys please no shame here okay this is a positive environment and the truth is um our bodies are amazing and I'm glad you guys are asking these questions are really good questions so let me know what you think about this video tell me other questions you have uh let me know if you haven't had sex for a while if you've noticed any other changes with your vagina that I haven't mentioned and by the way this was not an all-inclusive  this so

Y281	https://youtu.be/W9I_GCHiOKM?si=Rgj7Pj1Pv3tn5YxY	- You know, as we go through life, we learn a lot about what is considered common knowledge. Things that are passed around by our family, friends and teachers. But, what if I told you that some of the common knowledge that you believe to be truth is actually all wrong? This is "Myths You Still Believe", the series all about explaining the truth behind the most commonly believed myths. In this, the pilot episode of this new series, we aim to tackle the myths that were taught to us as kids about our own bodies.  Remember when you were a kid and you'd make faces like and your mom would be like, "If you keep making that face it's gonna stay like that forever"? Yeah, spoiler alert, myth. So get ready, because here are "7 Myths You Still Believe About Your Body". Not wearing a coat makes you sick. Here is a myth that everybody living farther than six inches from the equator has heard before. The notion that temperature alone can lead to colds and flu illnesses has been passed around for well over 100 years  and has been proven completely wrong. Illnesses are caused by viruses, and though it's true that they spread more frequently in colder seasons, you're actually more likely to contract one inside than outside. See, it's the exact opposite of what you were told. Science is flipping it on you. In fact being outside, warm or cold, may actually help prevent illness, especially with a more active lifestyle. So, get out there and be active, run around. Don't swim right after eating. As kids, many of us were told to never swim  30 minutes after consuming a meal or you could cramp up and drown. In fact, you can still hear mothers at the beach today telling their children to wait patiently in the sand while their food digests. Yeah, myth. First of all, food takes hours and hours to digest, not half an hour. And while yes, the process of digestion can cause cramps, the theory that blood immediately leaves the limbs to aid digestion is absolutely false. You are not going to lose the use of your arms and legs just because your stomach's having a hard time  breaking down a ham sandwich. Mmm, that was good, oh, digestion's begun. Can't shake your hand, can't high five you, sorry. Limbs are out of commission. Blood is blue until oxygenized. Your veins are lying to you. Well them and whoever was the one to tell you this incredibly common misconception. Despite the bluish color of the lines running up and down your arms and legs, all of your blood is red. This is due to the iron-infused hemoglobin which is a red-colored protein that binds with oxygen.  The reason that your veins appear blue is because your skin filters light wavelengths differently and reflects them back to what your eyes perceive as a blue color. Any surgeon will tell you that once someone is on the operating table, there are no blue veins to be found. Just trust me, it's all red. (imitates gagging) I don't like talking about it, just, they're red. Moving on. Swallowed gum stays in you for seven years. This little piece of folklore was invented shortly after the invention of chewing gum,  probably by parents and teachers who didn't want their kids chewing gum either when they were about to fall asleep or in the classroom. It was told that accidentally swallowed gum would remain in your body for seven years while your stomach tried to dissolve it. Now while it's true that gum can't properly be digested, it's a total farce to claim that it stays in your stomach. Remaining intact, it simply moves through your digestive system and leaves your body the same way that other waste does, poopy!  That being said, don't go swallowing large amounts of gum because it could cause constipation and you're going to have a hard time explaining that one to your doctor. Bubble farts and whatnot, it's just weird. Shaving hair makes it grow thicker. If this were only true. While this claim was made mostly to men in their late teens to encourage them to stay clean shaven, it's about as factual as believing that whiskey actually puts hair on your chest. This was disproved as far back as 1928 when a study in shaving showed that there was no change  in the thickness or speed in which hair grew back. Now, hair that grows back can feel coarser after shaving, but that's actually just because the tip of it is less natural due to the razor slicing it. And let's face it, if shaving made hair grow back thicker, we'd all look like walking mops immediately following our teen years. Sure, I'm just going to shave, bleh. Just, no. Waking a sleepwalker can hurt them. While it certainly is jarring to suddenly realize that instead of being safe in bed you're standing in your own kitchen,  the idea that you can somehow damage someone's brain or cause them to have a heart attack just by waking them is completely false. In fact, it's actually more often dangerous to not wake a sleepwalker. People have been known to fall down stairs, wander into the street, or even attempt driving, not knowing what they're doing. In fact, as it turns out, waking a sleepwalker can actually be more unsafe for you than them as sometimes the confusion can cause them not to recognize you and lash out physically.  (imitates sleepwalker) Oh, I'm sleeping... (screams) Who is you? Ah, ah! Just, that could happen, just watch out now. Sitting too close to a TV ruins your vision. This myth claims that if you're too close to a screen, the brightness and moving images can either blind you or make you go permanently cross eyed, both of which are just plain silly. This idle threat has been around since TVs were first invented, and is rumored to have been started by a doctor who linked distance from a screen with epilepsy in the 1970s.  The truth is, most families just used it as a way to get their kid's big head out of the way. You should have seen me as a kid. I looked like a pumpkin on a toothpick. I still kind of do, it's a big melon. Thank you guys so much for watching the pilot episode of "Myths You Still Believe".

be legal to meet weed Tycoon Steve D'Angelo at the site of what will soon become the world's biggest marijuana dispensary did you ever think that you'd like one day have like a Best Buy siiz retail facility like if this is a place where cannabis lives now like did you ever think it would live in a place like this yeah you know I've I've always imagined this from the time was about 15  years old uh what's what surprised me is how long it's taken us to get here there's nothing more American than what's happening with cannabis now man you know cannabis stayed the same for like 8,000 years basically there was very little change in cannabis and the product right then it collided with American Ingenuity uh nothing's ever going to be the same and we're now you know talking about how the Pie Gets diced up and you know whose livelihood is going to be effective in a positive and possibly a negative way so it starts  becoming very very serious it's about people being able to pay their mortgage and some really keeping the farm you know what I mean keeping the farm keeping the [Applause] [Music] [Music] Farm California supplies up to 80% of all the weed in the US and the Emerald Triangle a remote free County region north of San Francisco is C weeds epicenter producing an estimated 4 to7 billion doar of marijuana a year it all started in the' 60s the first plants were sewn by hippies who migrated from San Francisco and Beyond into the hills  to live private lives off the land and illegally grow weed while the Cannabis became famous and their numbers grew The Growers remained a hidden and Ultra secretive community in 1996 California passed proposition 215 making it the first state to legalize medical marijuana and allowing Farmers to grow small numbers of plants legally for the first time while some Farmers embraced medical growing others continued to grow illegally now California looks set to move beyond the restrictions of medical  legalization to full recreational legalization sounds like great news but the market will be open to Big pocketed investors and that could result in gargantuan weed factories putting small cannabis Farmers out of business will California's full legalization end up shutting independent Growers out of the very culture they [Music] created oh Another Day in Paradise good morning ladies smells like OG I'm in the hills of mesino County to meet Casey O'Neal a third generation HT farmer who's hoping he and his fellow  ganja Growers won't lose their foothold in what might become the biggest marijuana Market on the planet you know I grow very specific types of strains to call them the thunderbucket face punch uh they have very wait what do you call it thunder bucket face punch very strong very heavy this is the land I was born and raised on in the early early days days it was it was really rough they hauled water from town they had no money and then one of the neighbors ke my grandpa in to the magic that was grown in the woods and we  started to realize like canvis was a potential so this has been my home my whole life except for when I went to college yeah and then as I came of age and it became my farm and so over time it has developed into my livelihood my office my reality and so you know to be able to live and farm on the place that I was born and raised on is a is a powerful thing we got this guys we got this yep so you can see that we've got these kale plants that are kind of growing up and the Cannabis is getting bigger so what  we're going to do is we're going to clear back the kale first you kind of make a little bunch and sometimes we'll we'll bundle them I like to just throw it in the tub rather than bundling it but it's kind of you know f with proclivities and so is it common to grow vegetables that you eat right next to cannabis like this we've been doing some surveys uh 40% of our small cannabis Farms cultivate uh other food crops for market and 75% of our Farms cultivate food crops for personal consumption without  cannabis I would not grow production vegetables at all the work is too hard the pay is too little this is part of a system that helps make small farms work our entire reality especially here in the triangle is supported fundamentally by cannabis dollars Timber went out a long time ago fishing went out a long time ago this is the Fallout of an industrial Timber regime and this land has been used for industrial practices in the past and and then sort of relegated to the hippies and and we have been able to breathe life back into it  and create these microscale homesteads these self-supporting Farms we didn't do this because it was a job we did it because it was a way of life and cannabis was part of that do you think that this way of life is in Jeopardy yes I looked at the future of Regulation and I said I'm not going to survive and when the thing goes into legitimacy the idea that we would be denied the right to participate in it it would be a great tragedy it comes back to advocacy and being part of the democratic process because there's a  river of corporate money heading our way from a variety of different corporate interests who would love to see the thing develop under a commodity corporate perspective that doesn't include us and so they try to typ cast us as Criminal and so to be able to represent myself and say I'm not some nameless faceless criminal I'm me this is what I do and cannabis is part of it and it should be allowed to be changes the dynamic the number one question I get outside the area is well how quickly can you scale  yeah and my response is by definition craft does not scale I can't there's an estimated 53,000 small farms in California that grow cannabis and the question is will we be surfs producing things for conglomerates or will be will we be specialized micro craft scale Farms see you guys are all sort of banding together as cannabis Farmers to sort of make sure or like hope that the regulations that come out when legalization happens in 2016 carves out a niche for you guys being able to sort of stand for that has been both very  difficult but very invigorating it's like we're people didn't end up out here in the Hills because they were public people they ended up out here because they really liked their privacy and so dragging it into the public has been very difficult and and trying and it's hard but in a sense you think that's what you have to do to survive totally and that's why the more effective we are at banding together and representing ourselves as business owners as Crafts People the more of us will make it today Casey is hosting a recruitment  meeting for the emerald growers association a lobbying group he chairs he wants to unite local cannabis farmers and business owners to influence lawmakers in Sacramento and swing the coming marijuana legalization in their favor has the co-op on one side I'm going to do a a legislative update I'll talk about what's been going on in the state legislature it's been pretty hectic there's going to be compromises that we're not going to like but there's going to be lots of stuff that we really needed to happen that'll be there and  you know at this point I'm confident that we are making our voices heard enough to carve out the things that we absolutely must have so we're holding these barbecues and these workshops and we're getting the experts together and we're figuring out how do we help our Farms make the transition cuz nobody's compliant I'm not compliant none of our Farms are compliant right now but we've never had the opportunity to know what compliance is and that's so what it is can we do individually or as Farms to  make this thing go forward communicate with everybody join EG come to Sacramento talk to your people that are Eastward win the hearts and minds I think you know that we all have to take that step to join the co-op and work together we can't all just you know hide and do our own thing if we want to survive the thing is we keep telling our story that's the whole point this is you know families this is you know lots of people are just making a simple living which is like the American dream the family farm  with an honest product really they call it criminal but we know it's the most honest product you can produce because it it's beautiful it's healing and uh it's magic it comes back to we were really successful at creating this Mystique nobody knows anything about us they have all these default positions about us you guys are all like criminals and pillagers right and us coming and being like ah this is who we are they're like oh you guys are a bunch of hippies okay cool it feels like a you know a  really Monumental shift is happening and and we're shoving hard can we eat now while Casey has successfully coed this band of marijuana Farmers out of hiding to join forces and push the coming policy in their favor I wonder if this is really the best option these Farmers have for surviving the arrival of big business while old school Growers like are tackling policy in the hills of Menino I've come down to the township of Leonville to speak with a new breed of Weed Farmer these guys moved to the  triangle after medical marijuana went legal in the 9s and they became known as the green rushers among them were Jessica and Jamie [Music] warm Jamie met Jessica at Burning Man as she was completing her PhD I know that's a sheep that's a sheep yeah and gives to the Sheep they are now raising their child Donovan on this idilic Farm where they also grow weed Northern California is one of the last places where you can you can grow and Homestead you know um on some relatively cheap California land right right here we have our Greenhouse  uhhuh the strains here I'm really excited about so in the back here we have a harleen we have a um an OG black and that's called happy valentine these small things are agent orange Donovan's watering they're they're tiny ones they're small sometimes I feel a little funny talking about strands when I'm in front of my kid or kids generally is that right yeah I mean I don't know it's a maybe a testament to how strong the stigma can be which is like this is something I do all the time I talk to people about weed  all the time and yet I feel sometimes a little like hesitant to be like oh OG again right something that I think we're coming out of and you know that's one thing that is so wonderful about this community this is just part of who we are you know uh the Cannabis is everywhere you know we throw barbecues here people bring kids the plants are here and it's just a normal thing while it's an Open Secret that marijuana farming is a huge industry in the Emerald Triangle most Growers have stayed hidden in the Hills due to the  ongoing threat of prosecution but in order to battle the large scale operators who will set up shop when the California Market goes fully legal Jam wants to be first to Market so he's taken the risk of opening a nursery on Main Street between a thrift shop and a health food store where patients and other Growers can buy clones of his plants this is the spot this is artifact Nursery cool hi this is Camille this to meet you come on in Krishna cool welcome this is it this is it this is where patients come in and  get signed in mhm so this is where all the plants are this is really the nuts and bolts of the nursery uhhuh you can smell it can you a familiar smell around here I must be used to it the hardest worker is ham right here on the floor he looks like he's hard at work hey man how are you you how you doing good patients can come in look at the Clones uh you know got a lot of different genetics you have like three different sizes you have like small Med that's exactly what we have so we start them in Rockell here  get you a pretty little babies so those are $12 you've got these they step up into 3 and2 in soil they've kind of grown a little more have a stronger root mass right uh and then you can buy them as large plants as well those are ready to these look pretty nice those are ready to grow one those in my apartment so what's this one here that's oldfashioned MH locally breed strain what I like about your spot here is that we're in the center of town basically like yeah mhm it's a very like clear recognition of something that  everyone knows which is in the Hills there are a bunch of people growing growing weed well there's two kinds of people in mesino County those that say they grow weed and those that don't say they grow weed those that are lying right so you're trying to I mean what it is is like here in this sort of like weed Capital you're putting down some rout some stake in the in the Main Street to say like we're a business are there any risks that are associated with that like what's on the line a lot yeah the risks yeah I mean it's  federally illegal um but uh you know it's it's allowed in the state of California for medical use and we just are doing our absolute best to stay within the guidelines yeah we abide by all the rules set forth prop 215 um and yeah and just take take that risk proposition 215 was a ballot initiative to make medical marijuana legal in California and was passed by the public in 1996 it allowed individual counties to make their own rules which include limits on the number of plants that can be grown and stipulated Growers must be  nonprofit but could receive quote unquote reasonable compensation a term left open to interpretation unsurprisingly enforcement of these regulations have been difficult for Growers to predict Federal and local police routinely conduct sweeping raids often tarring legal and illegal Growers with the same brush recently Trinity humbal and mesino County Sheriff's departments teamed up to conduct one of the largest raids busting multiple Farms over 4 days in June 2015 and destroying close to 100,000  plants everybody knows someone up here that's gone to jail right for something you know it's all pot related and I think that's a very real thing for a lot of us up here raising families raising small children is that there's always an element of risk whether you grow 25 plants or you grow 100 plants or you don't even grow on your property you grow on another property it keeps us up at night sometimes I think it can keep everyone up at night right getting anxiety about the police coming or um hey baby you know you worry it's like  that irrational fear that someone's going to take your child away from you I know huh that will never [Laughter] happen the level of danger faced by marijuana producers like the warms who dare to make themselves visible is decided by local authorities interpretation of crop 215 I went to speak with mesino Sheriff Tom mman to find out how he decides whom to raid what are some of the challenges of being in law enforcement in a region like Menino County where there's so much marijuana grown well I the challenges  are not that there's so much marijuana growing the challenge is that the laws that are on the books are not black and white and I'm going to say that there is no agreement on what the law marijuana laws are in California so my focus is to go after the people who are in my opinion taking advantage of the Goodwill voters of 1996 when they passed proposition 2115 and how are people taking advantage of that proposition well I proposition 2115 was written to be a medicinal marijuana ordinance a law and it's a very vague law but  20-year-old with a sore shoulder who says he's growing to improve his quality of life maybe needs to suck it up and get a job and uh the sore shoulder is going to go away and they've turned it around to say this is my god-given right to grow marijuana well wait a minute is it god-given right of your neighbor to be able to go in their backyard and trim their roses or have a barbecue without smelling marijuana I say it is and I imagine since this is such a big County that the actual nuts and bolts of  enforcement is kind of a challenge in and of itself for the most part our marijuana investigations are complaint driven you know if a neighbor called and said my neighbor's growing marijuana and I think the Sheriff's Office should investigate our Deputy would go to the house and they' look and if need be eradicate the Marijuana arrest the person and see that they get their day in court do you think that people should be able to grow marijuana and make a living from it I think people should abide by the law and  proposition 215 wasn't a proposition on how to make your house payment if they're selling one plant as and making a profit on it they're in violation of the law because they're a commercial marijuana operation I mean the reason I asked that question is that there are a lot of people who believe that the only way to survive as a medical marijuana grower in this County specifically as like legalization in California might come you have to be upfront you have to say this is who I am I am a grower but  they feel that the danger of doing that is getting undue enforcement on uh compliance issues from the sheriff's department I can tell that you've been influenced by some people's very strong opinions well and in a sense I'm trying to bring their their complaints to you to see how that uh how you respond to them remember when proposition 2115 was passed by the voters it did not allow for any profit Heering so while there's people who say this is how I make my living you know and I have to make my  house payment I have to pay my child's orthodon bills and so forth I'm saying well that's great but that's not what the law is you know the law might change there's like certainly a lot of energy towards making recreational or adult use legal is that something you'd be in favor of how do you think that would affect the county I have so many things to worry about throughout my day that I do not spend a lot of time on hypotheticals sure but it's something that seems to be coming like the marijuana the legalization of  marijuana is a wave that's kind of hitting a lot of this country and medino County humbal County Trinity County it's where a lot of of the marijuana in this country is grown so how is it that you aren't preparing in a like sort of what how are you preparing you know I'm going to guess you're very good at what you do of of doing interviews and knowing how to operate a film crew and whatever okay I I'm very good at enforcing the law so while so excuse me I listen to you listen to me okay no one can predict  where we're going and and if we don't know where we're going we don't know what our problems are if we don't know what our problems are going to be we don't know what the solutions are yet but we'll figure it out thanks Sheriff appreciate the time while the worms take a risk by becoming the first to Market with a brick and mortar on Main Street I'm driving to humbold County just north of mesino to meet an altogether different kind of marijuana farmer hidden among the mountains here presiding over much  larger grows this region is home to the millionaire Outlaw so I'm going to meet this guy Ziggy who's been farming here for decades and apparently he uses a BMW as his farm truck so he's doing pretty well well here we are wild cat Farms this is called wild cat Farms wild cat farms and so this is one sort of large grow operation so how many plants are in this parcel right here this is a 99 plot uhhuh down below is Blue Dream uhhuh on the lower part of the tier what we're walking through here is old school AK-47  and I have Sour Diesel and what we found out is some of these fuy strains like the sour diesel have a synergestic effect with the opiates an American love drugs and when the doctor gives them the oxy the sour d or the OG gives that oxy a little extra bang for the buck like you take a look at this and it's big like this is a lot these are a lot of plants but like what what's the surrounding area like what what what did we pass when we were driving here oh you probably passed 700 farms in the 17 miles coming up the hill as you notice  700 700 yes there's probably a billion dollars annually in cannabis money that comes to this County you go to the gas station they have a cash counting machine um people come in that are running Diesel and might buy $77,000 worth of fuel in $20 bills that you can either weigh the 20 or you can run it through the machine but it it's a very unique cash economy here and where is that money going right now um it's going into the bank of the stump what's the bank of the stump we can't we don't bank with like the real Banks cuz they  take our money and they tattle on us so we have to hide our money you know in Humble County it's not uncommon to hear people um talk about I forgot where I buried 500k yeah that's sound would be really stressful it's just the the reality of it and how long have you been doing this for 40 years you've been growing weed for 40 years yes for a long time like it was not it was not legal oh God no no felony pot yeah felony pot did you ever get taken down or busted oh gosh yes I've been arrested yeah but never  convicted of a felony I was acquitted what is it like to go from something that was kind of like an outlaw business to something that is now considered potentially this corporate business the the corporate structure of now becoming friends with the banks who have never been my friends before and friends with the police who've never protected or served me um no no no I don't want to play that charade I'm 56 years old I'm about done I'd like to help take this to the legalization level and be able to hand the torch on to the  next Generation to improve or destroy it right but I would like to go buy a Maserati with a company paycheck before I'm done having made millions in his 40 years as an outlaw grower Ziggy is cashing out in face of full legalization I went to speak with the next generation of humbal wheat grower Ziggy's Protege Leo Stone about the financial impact of total legalization you have to have a certain level of scale just so you can be profitable because it's not a cheap business to cultivate cannabis right let's get in  it and what are these can these are sour diesel can you tell me like where Sour Diesel tends to be the most popular man sour d is the most popular on the East Coast you know um for the large part A lot of the buyers that come to pick up sour d are from the East Coast I mean in a sense it's an export crop right because it's so it's so popular around the country I wish it wasn't I wish we could keep the crop in state there's a lot of risk that's that's in play with people coming from the east coast and  buying your crop you know you you have to deal with the uncertainty that your buyer's not going to come back next year because there's a lot of risk for buyer just to come from the East Coast bring that large amount of capital so he could be able to buy up your crop then he has to send it back we're taking product out of state it'd be safer we kept it in States yeah but the retail prices in cannabis and California alone have kind of you know they remain the same you know past 7 to 10 years you're looking  at anywhere from a $6,000 to a $9,000 P pound retail right you know you cut that in half you know Growers should usually be getting anywhere from like 35 to 45 a pound which is what the status quo was for a long time but you know for some reason people are having a really hard time settling for 12 to, 1500 a pound and you know the general consensus in meno and humble is that you know a lot of a large part of the reason the bottom has dropped out of the wholesale Market was because of dispensaries the  illegality of marijuana has historically kept its prices artificially high with premedical marijuana prices peaking at close to $5,000 per pound after prop 215 was passed the prices Farmers could get for wholesale weed entering the medical marijuana Market dipped down to below $2,000 per pound by 2010 once the market goes fully legal in California it's expected that prices will drop even further due to the arrival of corporations that can produce on a large scale making the survival of small craft Farmers even less likely but  then what do you do as Growers do you keep you get bigger do you like how do you sort of combat the the falling prices it depends on what kind of price point you're looking for and it depends on who your network is because people that come from the Midwest and East Coast cannabis prices are inflated while Leo's Reliance on the black market might work as a short-term solution to weed's price drop what's going to happen if more states legalize or if California cracks down in the black market [Music]  entirely one farmer trying to find a sustainable solution to pot's Falling wholesale prices is Swami chya he runs ganja ma Gardens alongside his life partner Nikki lto and together they're capitalizing on his reputation as a maestro grower of Premium pot Swami was born in New York in 1943 and moved to San Francisco in the late 60s where he immersed himself in hippie culture that spiritual journey led him to India where he spent over 10 years he converted to Hinduism and became a spiritual teacher known as a Swami and  that's Po and Sh not the lord of the universe and then as you dance you can go the other leg too the same way the other leg and back and forth right like that returning to America he found his Indian spirituality Blended perfectly with the ideology of the back to the land hippie farmers who founded the Emerald Triangle and he has since become a Mainstay of the community and an expert cannabis [Music] producer that's that's me okay um I'm wondering can you take us around your property and sort of show us what you  got here all right how did you get inspired to do this well actually I had a vision a long time ago mhm it was on July 4th and we're all just like in Bliss with the nature and so on and and the medicine of the Peyote the sacred medicine MH I had this Vision I was about halfway down the mountain it's like someone turned on a slide projector right here in my third eye and this picture was like there was this this mountain this rounded mountain in the distance and then there was these trees this row of trees and then there was  this Golden Meadow yeah and then behind me these two giant pine trees is and this is like right here in my forehead and this say This brilliant picture right so then 30 years later almost to the day we took possession of this place and that was 12 years ago mm and how's it how does it feel to have sort of like a 30-year Vision kind of come true but then at the same time have that Vision kind of lay Complicated by the big business of of cannabis if say in Fresno Merced Central Valley they put up these  huge green houses and they're growing thousands and thousands of plants yeah that could take our Market away it's up to us to promote our product saying that this is pure it's organic it's grown in the Sun and it's the finest that you can possibly get and it has spirit and if you're going to industrialize something you're going to take the spirit out who do you want to grow your cannabis and how you want them to grow it you look like the kind of person I want to grow my cannabis well I'm very happy to do  that for you maybe we should go look at him yeah let's take a look okay so here we are at the Garden just walking out amongst them you're n mhm you're kind of exalted in a way just from the fact of this the air that they're creating these things are just in the sun this greenness and it's just it's thrilling to be in the plants we have a clean green certification which is actually more stringent than organic and so as a result we don't get 6 and 8 pound plants we get one to two to three to maximum maybe four pounds so  that's another kind of Challenge almost that you're another chall but that's why we're saying if you want the purest the best you can't be looking for quantity you're looking for quality and in order for that to sort of work economically you would need the per pound cost to sort of Bear right well but see we're hoping that that that the price of cannabis is not simply a bulk commodity price you know like wheat Futures in Chicago M because it's got to be quality priced just like wine you can buy Two  Buck Chuck maybe you're happy with that fine enjoy sure but if you want a real Ambrosia right you're going to pay 30 40 $50 $60 for for one bottle and we do get a premium price for our cannabis we definitely do what are the what's the sort of you know going rate for your stuff versus may not whether I really ought to tell you okay uh going rate for a wholesale pound of cannabis is anywhere from $1,000 to $1,500 a pound mhm M we get from 22 to 27 so maybe that sort of cuts to the heart of it in a sense is  like is weed a commodity or well weed might be a commodity but cannabis isn't okay right and so actually in our Movement we are trying to use only the word cannabis because it is what you call it and we're calling it weed it's not a weed look at this beautiful plant and it's not just growing [Music] randomly so listen we've been waiting a long time to get loaded here tell me which one would you like to smoke we got got CET here okay and take a smell of that one see this is what a connoisseur will  do the first thing they'll smell they'll smell the Cannabis and then they'll look at it it's a it's Piney and Lemony Piney and Lemony right and this one is called Orange turbo that's a little skunky and maybe like tea yeah mhm I don't know you tell me which yeah well no you tell me it's your nose it's your weed right cannabis [Music] and how did you guys me known each other a long time I could begin to guess how many joints we've smoked together over that time well not only that but how many incarnations  we've had together sure now in a very new incarnation of this relationship because well we have a spiritual marriage yeah you have a spiritual well he he took a lot of vows when he became a Swami I say it's not one of those vows being s mag but what's even worse is he doesn't eat onion and garlic and I'm Italian so that's the hardest part but let's show that to the cameras like like on John Stewart or something like that it's like Uncle benle Ben converted cannabis what it started as a joke really but then it became The Branding  is for real you know this is something if you're going to get into the future Market you better start your branding now so we were very lucky we already kind of had a foot in the door we're actually getting a tradar marked and everything as we speak yeah oh yeah well and it's also like you have uh in Swami like a personification of the actual product that you're kind of selling right he is s of a good image well he fits yeah really one of the things we're doing with the Swami select salons is you know  that the people that you know meet the grower meet the farmer so it's an educational process to say wouldn't you really rather have your cannabis grown at Turtle Creek for 60 bucks an eight oh I'm feeling pretty [Music] uh I could see Swami's brand becoming akin to the D peran of marijuana a prestigious Market position he and other small independent labels will need to hold out against the might of corporate [Music] cannabis I've come to the largest wholesale medical marijuana purchaser in the world Harborside dispensary to speak  with owner Steve D'Angelo I wanted to know how the biggest player in the current medical marijuana market and the Cannabis tycoons who will follow him will affect the craft scale farmers of the Emerald Triangle you come through these doors and you see this kind of like beautiful Mecca of like of cannabis sales it's amazing so here you'll see our sample cases are all of these are grown in California all of these are grown in California is this a typical dispensary well we are probably the largest retailer of cannabis in the  world as far as I know uh when we first opened this spot uh people looked at me like I was crazy they're like you're never going to be able to serve as many patients it's way too big so now we're going to go from the public part of the facility into the private secure part usually not this so uh this is the intake room this is where Growers will uh bring us their medicine and we put it through a quality control process I'll show you how that happens so big bags of weed here yeah I mean it depending on what your scale is  uh we would call these average size bags of weed well I'll pretend to be a grower who comes in all right so hey Steve hey CHR how you gr this weed for you all right well let's take a look at it and so what I'm going to be looking for here is you can see there's some little crystall and structures on the surface of the vegetable material there so those are called tricomes and that's where all of the active ingredient of the cannabis plant lives there is no active ingredient in the vegetable material  itself uh so by looking at the size and the shape the color and the density of those tricomes we can get a basic understanding of the quality of that cannabis the potency of the Cannabis and whether or not it was grown to full maturity or Beyond full maturity a lot of your economics I'm imagining are based on how you price your inventory as it comes in and for the farmer a lot of their economics is based on how much they can get for each pound that they sell well this is really the most critical part of our whole  business model because if we don't buy the Cannabis that our patients want we won't be able to sell it right so where are we headed now we are uh getting close to the most secure part of the facility which is the Vault where we store our cash where we store our bulk medicine mhm so uh this room also is biometrically controlled [Music] okay watch your step on the way up here so this is our vault well it smells great in here yeah well for obvious reasons we don't want to have ventilation shafts in the most secure  part of the facility so don't drop in here you'll see some of the bulk cannabis that's come in recently uh-huh and so you can see here all this cannabis is uh is in our branded right exactly so is this stuff that you guys grow or is this this is farmer grown no this is just our standard packaging so whatever grower brings us to it our top shelf always goes into these jars mhm what is the actual flow of cannabis to money like give me a sense of the sort of scale of the operation well we sell several pounds of cannabis uh every day  uh and we take in you know north of $25 million a year uh at this particular shop right prop 215 requires that all marijuana companies including Steves remain nonprofit putting extra earnings into community services and Charities we will happily Embrace a for-profit model with equal enthusiasm as soon as that's legal but until then we'll obey the law rigorously until now Steve has been buying weed from local Growers like Swami and repackaging it thwarting any attempts they make at branding themselves but Steve has even bigger  plans for when Pop becomes legal that will change the industry completely so uh right now we are in one of central California's traditional agricultural regions and we're going to be touring uh what I think uh is the future of cannabis agriculture in California or at least a part of that future uh-huh wow this is huge yeah this is uh this is quite a large greenhouse and how many plants do you think could fit in one of these warehouses or one of these green houses um you depend entirely on the size of the plant uh but in the  thousands of plants thousands of plants and they would produce thousands of pounds of of Bud they would it's exciting right I mean like there's a there's a way of looking at this and saying like wow this is a lot of weed that's going to be grown here in California by scaling up we're going to be able to start providing the consistency uh that the Market's really looking for and would you be able to operate a place like this at full capacity under the medical laws or would recreational marijuana have to be  legalized uh right now this would is not something that would be sanctioned uh by regulation we're working ahead we're looking forward to the day when that will happen how will places like this affect the sort of larger industry and the way that people grow there's certainly going to be displacement as this industry changes my hope and my belief is that this industry can be created in a way so that there's a lot of different tiers uh for different levels of production I think that there's plenty of consumers  who are not going to want cannabis that's produced in a large facility at a large scale they're going to want cannabis that's grown in very small plots by Master Gardeners and I think of anybody's a really talented cannabis grower or a really talented concentrate maker or a really talented manufacturer of cannabis products that they're going to have a much much better future in the legal economy than they do in the underground economy now people who have just sort of been skating along uh because it's illegal and they don't need  to try very hard and they don't need to compete uh those folks are not going to have a place in the new market and and you know I don't think that's a bad thing you know when we say big marijuana and you look at a place like that could have a potential like this would someone say that you are big marijuana and you're going to steal my business or you're going to steal my market share or you know you're embodying a future that might not be in line with what we think the plant is I don't think the big  marijuana is a Bad Thing uh I think that big marijuana done the way that every other Big Industry in this country has been done is a bad thing but we have a potential to create a new kind of industry and that's what we need to do look there's going to be a battle for the soul of this industry uh it's underway already uh there's going to be people who are going to try and craft it in the image of every other single American corporate industry and the only way that that is not going to happen is if people who care about the plant and  people who care about the future step up to the plate and start creating companies and start creating products and start creating brands that will be values based [Music] propositions after my time here I've come to realize that however the small farmers choose to adapt be it by branding their Farms as the Dom peran of cannabis or passing the mantle to the Next Generation uniting with fellow Farmers to influence legislation or rushing to become the first to market the likely winner in this new era of legalization will be the  consumer marijuana quality options and services will increase while prices will fall and so it goes in America big business will make the bulk of profits while the tens of thousands of Growers of the Emerald Triangle will fight to stay alive in this Brave New Marketplace these farmers are more than just stoners ERS making easy money in the Hills they are the heart and soul of marijuana farming in America and a living link to its Origins and so the fact that a great number of them will not survive this  transition feels like a loss whether legalization spells the death of the very society that founded this industry or whether growing evolves into something even better one thing's for sure it's been a privilege to have glimpsed this Bastion of renegade cannabis culture before it burns out [Music] hello [Music]
